Script Processing
=================

Quick introduction to script processing:

1) Install Python 2.7 along with it's nltk and matplotlib packages:
* [nltk installation instructions](http://nltk.org/install.html)
* [matplotlib installation instructions](http://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html)

2) Install a git client.

3) Create an account for yourself on github, and set up SSH keys to the account.

4) Run: ```git clone git@github.com/matt-viblio/tsl```

5) Add the parent directory of the tsl directory to your PYTHONPATH environment variable, on *NIX this can be done with:

```source setup-env.sh```

On the setup-env.sh file in the tsl directory.

6) Look at the example film scripts in [example-scripts](example-scripts)

7) Process the scripts into a parsed format by running:

```
cd utils
./parse_scripts.py
```

8) Look at the parsed output under example-scripts/parsed

9) Look at the [generate_reports.py](utils/generate_reports.py) and [partition.py](utils/partition.py) utility scripts for examples with what can be done with the parsed data (these scripts will produce their output under the example-scripts/parsed director)
