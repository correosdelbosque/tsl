No object is so beautiful that, under certain 
conditions, it will not look ugly.

FADE IN:
EXT. RUDYARD, MONTANA - NIGHTFALL - DEAD OF WINTER

Down a long country highway on the Montana Highline is a city 
sign for RUDYARD, MONTANA.  Its mostly covered by an icy 
snow drift but enough can be seen to make out the citys 
population.  

Its January and Rudyard is cold.  Barren.  Hollow.  Endless.  

Thousands of acres of shivering cattle and frozen ground.  

Off in the distance, the soft glow of a ranch house just 
barely lights the landscape.  Its a small, humble house on a 
never ending piece of land. 

The kind of house you might drive by and think Who lives 
there?.

INT. KITCHEN OF THAT RANCH HOUSE - SAME TIME

VIVIAN HUNTSMAN is 36.  Shes pretty but you can see the 
long, hard, quiet minutes of life creasing the corners of her 
eyes, dulling the sheen of her skin.

She opens the oven and pulls out a pitch-perfect roast that 
would make any chef proud.

But Vivian could give two shits less about it. 

She jabs a carving knife and fork into the hunk of meat and 
carries it out.

INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Vivian lays the roast on the table.

Her three sons LUKE (18, senior football star), RYDER (14, 
middle-school-most-popular), JACKSON (11 naughty country boy) 
and Vivians only daughter SUMMER (13 going on thirty, 
morbidly overweight and aware) are at the table waiting for 
the vittles.

Vivian looks at the lone empty chair at the head of the 
table.  


INT. DEN - CONTINUOUS
Vivians husband LEONARD, late 30s, wrangler-wearing-racist- 
cowboy, scratches his crotch as he watches an Elk Hunting 
Video on the VCR thats held together by electrical tape.

             VIVIAN
      Supper.

Leonard doesnt turn from the TV.

             LEONARD
      Better be beef.  Im growin tits 
      we been eatin so many god damn 
      vegetables lately.

ON THE VIDEO:  The HUNTER SHOOTS AN ELK DEAD IN THE EYES.

             LEONARD 
      Man, I gotta get out there more.  I 
      aint hit a fucker dead in the eyes 
      like that in ages.    

INT. DINING ROOM - A WHILE LATER

The family eats dinner together in quiet unison.  The sounds 
of Kool-Aid being chugged and forks hitting plates the only 
noise that fills the air. 

             LEONARD
        (without looking up from 
         his food)
      Got a bill today from the dentist. 
      What you gettin done that cost  
      two hundred dollars?

             VIVIAN
      A root canal.  I got a good deal.  
      It normally wouldve been five 
      times that much, at least.

Leonard looks up from his plate for the first time.

             LEONARD
      Well, next time just have it 
      pulled.  No more of this fancy 
      Hollywood dentist crap.

A moment of sorry life passes.

             VIVIAN
      It was a root canal.


Summer looks at her teeth in the reflection of her fork.
She does.

             SUMMER
      I wanna get braces to improve my 
      alignment.

             VIVIAN
        (smiles)
      Summer, you have perfect teeth.

             LUKE
      She just wants braces cause Katie 
      and Destinee both got em.

             SUMMER
      Nuh uh, Luke!  Thats not true!

             LUKE
      Yes it is.  Youre always tryin to 
      be like them.  Youre never gonna 
      be popular Summer.  May as well 
      stop tryin.

Ryder and Jackson laugh.  Summer gets up from the table and 
runs to her room.  

Vivian is white hot.  

             VIVIAN
        (to Luke)
      Dont you ever talk to your sister 
      like that again, do you hear me?

Vivian gets up and goes after Summer.

INT. SUMMERS BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Vivian knocks lightly on the door and walks in.  

             VIVIAN
      You ok?

Summer is on the bed, buried under the covers and crying 
loudly.

             SUMMER
      Yes.

The octave of her wails increase with every breath. Vivian 
sits on the edge of Summers bed and pulls the covers from 
over her head.

             SUMMER 
        (tripping on her breath)
      I...hate...all...humans...with...Y.
      ..chromosomes.  

Vivian couldnt agree more.  She strokes Summers face to 
calm her.

             VIVIAN
      Oh, sweetie. You love your brothers 
      and they love you. Theyre just...
        (cutting the B.S.)
      Acting like stupid boys because 
      boys are stupid.

Summer smiles through her tears.  

             VIVIAN 
      Youre a a very special girl 
      Summer. You know why?  Because you 
      are both kinds of beautiful. Youre 
      beautiful on the outside but more 
      important than that youre 
      beautiful on the inside.  Thats 
      the most important kind of 
      beautiful you can be.

Vivian kisses her on the forehead and heads toward the door.

	SUMMER
      Mom?
             
             VIVIAN
      Yeah?


             SUMMER
      Youre both kinds of beautiful too.

             VIVIAN
      Thanks baby.  

INT. VIVIAN AND LEONARDS BEDROOM - LATER

Vivian is in bed, her eyes glued to an OLD VHS VIDEO of DIANE 
SAWYER being INTERVIEWED ON LARRY KING LIVE.

ON THE TV:

             LARRY KING
      What was it like to go back?


             DIANE SAWYER
      After months of searching for them, 
      trying to find them... and after 
      the fall of the Taliban, once 
      again, our cameras in position, and 
      the door opened...

Leonard comes in the bedroom, and without a word, ejects the 
tape from the VCR to watch SPORTSCENTER.

             VIVIAN
        (stern, for Vivian)
      I was watchin that.

             LEONARD
      Youve seen it like a billion 
      times.  Its gettin weird.  Like 
      you got some kinda weird lesbian 
      love on her or somethin.

Vivian doesnt respond.  Her eyes fixed on the wall.

             LEONARD 
      You know what?  If youre gonna be 
      all pissy Im goin out.

Leonard grabs a hat and his Carhart jacket and walks out.  
Vivian lets a moment pass, hears the door slam and puts the 
tape back in the VCR.

ON THE TV:

             LARRY KING 
      Diane, what a feeling that must 
      have been?

             DIANE SAWYER
      It was, it was. Flying in, same 
      mountains, same terrain, same 
      beautiful people, and the 
      completely... well...
        (takes a moment)
      Hope changes everything, doesn't 
      it? 

Vivian presses pause and stares at Diane, studies her.  And 
then rewinds.

             DIANE SAWYER 
      Hope changes everything, doesnt 
      it?


EXT. SCHOOL BUS STOP -  SUNRISE
Vivian drops the kids off at the remote end-of-the-road bus 
stop. They pile out of the mini van bundled from head to toe.

             VIVIAN
        (shouts after them)
      Be good!

INT. WALMART - MORNING

Vivian strolls the cereal aisle.  She grabs a box of Post 
Raisin bran but looks at the shelf and sees that the generic 
store brand is fifty cents less.

She stares at the two boxes, torn.

She puts the Post back and throws the store brand in the 
cart, like always.

INT. DINING ROOM - LATER

Vivian sits at the dining room table eating a huge bowl of 
raisin bran.  She stares at the box, wishing with every bite 
it wasnt generic.

INT. KITCHEN - A WHILE LATER

Vivian hides the box of raisin bran way up high on top of the 
refrigerator behind a bunch of jars of disgusting looking 
pickled vegetables.  

Vivian doesnt see her but DARLEEN a thirty something, robust 
ranch wife with eighties hair, elastic waist pants and a 
great big smile stands just below her with a plate of cookies 
in hand.

             DARLEEN
      I made you Snickerdoodles!

Vivian loses her balance and just short of topples over.

             VIVIAN
      Jesus, Mary and Joseph! You scared 
      the living shit out of me, Darleen!

             DARLEEN
      Happens to me every morning when I 
      look in the mirror.  
      
(then)

             DARLEEN 
      Came by to see if you wanted to 
      grab lunch in town?  Its buy one 
      get one at Pork Chop Johns! On me. 
      Man I love those chops. 

             VIVIAN
      Thanks but I already did the two 
      hour round trip to Walmart and I 
      need to get something going for 
      supper soon.
        (re: hidden box)
      Plus I already ate two bowls of 
      raisin bran.

             DARLEEN
      I dont know how you eat so much of 
      that stuff.  Runs through me like a 
        (whispers)
      Kenyan
        (full voice)
      in a marathon!

             VIVIAN
      You whisper Kenyan like its a bad 
      thing.  I think Kenyan people like 
      being Kenyan.

             DARLEEN
      And as for supper, thats why our 
      father in heaven created KFC.

             VIVIAN
      You know I could never.

             DARLEEN
      Life is too short for nevers.  I 
      think today is as good a day as 
      any, dont you think?

             VIVIAN
      Next time, Dar.  

Vivian raises her pinky, ala pinky swear.

             VIVIAN 
      Promise.

EXT. SCHOOL BUS STOP - ALMOST DUSK

The kids pile into Vivians mini-van from the blustery, bleak 
bus stop.

INT. KITCHEN - A WHILE LATER

Vivian pulls out a white paper package that had been 
defrosting in the fridge. ELK written on it in thick, black 
marker.

She flops it on the counter, opens it and stares at the 
bloody, gamey meat.

INT. LUKE, RYDER AND JACKSONS ROOM - CONTINUOUS   

The boys lay around playing video games.  Homeworks not much 
of a focus around here.

             VIVIAN
      Boys, Ill be right back.  

Summer walks in behind her.

             VIVIAN 
      You and Luke hold the fort down for 
      a little bit, ok?

             SUMMER
      Ok.  Where are you going?

             VIVIAN
      Just gonna run a quick errand.

EXT. GAS STATION/KENTUCKY FRIED CHICKEN COMBO STOP - MINUTES 
LATER

Vivian pulls the mini van into the Gas Station KFC, the only 
fast food restaurant within thirty miles.

A BANNER that reads BUCKET OF CHICKEN AND ALL THE FIXINS 
FAMILY MEAL $12.99! flaps in the blustery, sub zero wind.

FADE TO:

FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER....

Vivian is still in the car.  Mulling it over. 

Desperate to take the dive and go in but swirling with 
uncertainty and fear. 

A sudden wave of confidence rushes over her. 

And she rides it.


             VIVIAN
        (feigned mantra)
      Life is too short for nevers.

She gets out of the car and heads into the KFC.

INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Vivian brings the BUCKET OF CHICKEN AND CONTAINERS OF SIDES 
out to the dining room. The kids swoon for the chicken and 
mashed potatoes.  

Leonard looks at Vivian, raging, speechless.  

             LUKE
      I wish we were rich and could eat 
      like this every night for the rest 
      of our lives.

             RYDER
      Me too.  

             LEONARD
      Well were not rich.  
        (pushes his empty plate 
         away)
      I aint eating this shit.

Leonard gets up and grabs his Carhart jacket and hat.

             VIVIAN
      But Leonard, its...

             LEONARD
        (cuts her off)
      Vivian, I dont want to hear it.  I 
      do my job.  You do yours.  End of 
      discussion.  
        (then)
      Ill be late.  Dont lock the door 
      in case I lose my keys again.

             VIVIAN
        (under her breath)
      My birthday.

INT. VIVIAN AND LEONARDS BEDROOM - LATER

Vivian folds a seemingly endless basket of laundry.  She 
grabs a stack of the folded clothes and puts them in the 
closet. 


She sees an old TONY LAMA BOOT BOX and pulls it down. 

Vivian sits on the bed and opens the box, carefully.  She 
pulls out AN ACCEPTANCE LETTER to the University of Montanas 
School of Journalism, A PHOTO of her giving the valedictorian 
address in high school, a SCHOLARSHIP OFFER... 

             VIVIAN
        (sighs, to herself)
      The box of what coulda been.

EXT. FRONT YARD - 3 AM

Leonard pulls his truck into the driveway, clipping the 
mailbox on his way in.  He parks and spills out.  

His KEYS FALL FROM HIS HAND into the snow.

Leonard gets to the front door and searches all of his 
pockets.

             LEONARD
        (baffled, wasted)
      Its like they disappear into the 
      god damn thin air.

EXT. BACKYARD - MINUTES LATER

Leonard GRABS A SAW from beside a pile of logs in the yard. 

EXT. BACK DOOR - CONTINUOUS

Leonard SAWS A HOLE AROUND THE DOORHANDLE until the handle 
pops off. He reaches his hand in the newly formed door-hole 
and unlocks the door.

             LEONARD
        (so proud)
      There.  Now I dont even need a 
      stupid ass key!

INT. VIVIAN AND LEONARDS BEDROOM - LATER

Vivian is sound asleep with the contents of her what coulda 
been box scattered around her, like a life collage.  

Leonard, piss drunk and horny-as-a-mutha-fucka barrels in and 
wakes her.

             VIVIAN
        (startled)
      Leonard! You scared me.

Vivian lays back down and curls into the covers.  Leonard  
undresses.  Hes stumbling and fowl.

             LEONARD
      I thought I said not to lock the 
      door.
        (then)
      Get naked.

             VIVIAN
      Its three in the morning.  Youll 
      be passed out before you could get 
      it up anyway.

             LEONARD
        (buck naked machismo)
      Hey, dont say that.  I can get it 
      up like a light switch, baby doll.

             VIVIAN
      Fine then. 

CUT TO:

TEN MINUTES LATER...

Offensively naked and gyrating in an oddly fast humping 
motion, Leonard is still trying to get it up.  With each 
gyration, his knees crushing the letters and photos from 
Vivians what coulda been box.

             LEONARD
        (to Vivian)
      Cmon!  Help me out!  Its like you 
      did some kinda voodoo on it.
        (to his penis)
      Do your thing fucker!

Vivian lays underneath him and stares at the ceiling with a 
look in her eyes that says only one thing...                

Is this really my life?

EXT. HOUSE - BACK DOOR - MORNING

Theres a blizzard outside.  Its horrible and status quo.  


Vivian dutifully covers the HOLE LEONARD SAWED with 
electrical tape.

INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

Vivian eats a bowl of her generic Raisin Bran as she admires 
an old black and white PHOTO OF DIANE SAWYER on the computer.  

Diane is wearing a sash and tiara.

THE CAPTION UNDER THE PHOTO READS: 

Diane got her first big break after winning the Junior Miss 
pageant

             VIVIAN
        (jokes to herself)
      Well, maybe thats what I should 
      do.

Vivian, just for fun, GOOGLES: beauty pageants for married 
women.  She gasps when MRS. MARRIED AMERICA PAGEANT pops up, 
right up at the top. 

She clicks on the BE A CONTESTANT tab and scrolls down the 
page.  She reads the CONTESTANT CRITERIA section.

             VIVIAN 
        (reads aloud to herself)
      Must be a natural born citizen of 
      the USA and currently married. 
      Previous titles should be noted and 
      will be considered and weighed 
      heavily during our selection 
      process. Please fill out the form 
      below and we will mail you an 
      application. 
        (thinks)
      Ive got two of the three.

INT. DARLEENS KITCHEN - LATER

An excited buzz in her grin, Vivian sits at Darleens Kitchen 
table while Darleen PULLS THE INNARDS OUT OF A GOOSE shes 
about to cook.

             DARLEEN
      Whats the smile all about?  
        (pulls the neck out of the 
         goose)
      Ah, there it is.


             DARLEEN 
        (then)
      Did you kill Leonard?

             VIVIAN
        (bursting with pride)
      Im gonna be in a beauty pageant!  
      Well, I think I am.  I want to be.  
      To try to be.
        (whispers like its top 
         secret)
      Mrs. Married America!

Darleen cracks up.

             DARLEEN
      Mrs. Married America?

Darleen laughs even harder.

             VIVIAN
      Im serious!

             DARLEEN
      Im sorry, its just...
        (through her laughter)
      I have this image of a bunch of 
      women bustin outta their old prom 
      dresses, covered in meat grease and 
      baby puke.

             VIVIAN
        (caught in her dream)
      Its my ticket Darleen.  This is 
      what I need to do.  
        (sighs)
      But they have to choose me first.
      Do you think a lot of women from 
      Montana will apply?

Darleen puts her goose innard covered hand on the hip of her 
oversized ankle gathered sweatpants.

             DARLEEN
      Well, I cant see why they wouldnt 
      but that doesnt mean you shouldnt 
      try.

             VIVIAN
      Theyre sending me a packet in the 
      mail. I gotta fill it out and put a 
      bunch of pictures in it and send it 
      in and then theyll decide.

             DARLEEN
      Thats it?  Thats all you gotta 
      do?

             VIVIAN
      Well, theres one other thing.

             DARLEEN
      Whats the one other thing?

INT. LIVING ROOM - TWO WEEKS LATER

Leonard and the kids are lethargically laid out in front of 
the TV watching AMERICAN IDOL.  Vivian walks in from the 
bedroom, dressed in jeans and a coat, carrying a large purse.

Shes wearing make up, not much, but some.

Leonard sees her. She looks pretty and he knows it.

             LEONARD
      You dont usually wear make up.

             VIVIAN
      Thanks for noticing.

             LEONARD
      Hey kids, dont Mom look kinda like 
      a clown with all that make up on?

The boys laugh.

             SUMMER
      I think you look pretty Mom.

             VIVIAN
      Thanks baby.
        (to Leonard)
      Ill be back in a few hours.  These 
      PTA meetings can run real long.

Leonard belches loudly.  

             LEONARD
      Can you grab me one of them 
      leftover deer sausages out of the 
      fridge before you go?

INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Vivian gags pulling the grey, homemade, barely cooked sausage 
out of the Ziplock bag in the fridge.


INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Vivian hands Leonard the sausage on a plate. He takes a huge 
bite of the cold greasy link.

             LEONARD
        (mouth full, re: American 
         Idol)
      The only reason that black girls 
      still around is cause they gotta 
      keep her on there cause of that 
      damn affirmative action.  She cant 
      sing worth a shit.
        (to the kids)
      Thats what we get for having a 
      black president.

Vivian takes a deep breath, composing herself as to not say 
the million things shed like to.

             VIVIAN
      Ok, well, Ill be back later.

             SUMMER
        (only one to look up)
      Bye Mom.

EXT. BLUE SKY COUNTY K-12 SCHOOL - LATER

Vivian and Darleen stand before a LARGE SIGN THAT READS: 4H 
INDOOR COUNTY CARNIVAL. 

             VIVIAN
        (nervous)
      Well, here goes nothin.

             DARLEEN
      I still dont get it.

             VIVIAN
      It said on the Mrs. Married America 
      website that previous titles are 
      weighed heavily when theyre 
      reviewing applications to be a 
      contestant.

Darleen looks at Vivian, sincerely confused.

             DARLEEN
      And you think this counts.

             VIVIAN
      Its all I got.


INT. BLUE SKY COUNTY K-12 SCHOOL - 4H INDOOR COUNTY CARNIVAL - CONTINUOUS

Vivian and Darleen walk into the school.  


             DARLEEN
      Viv?


             VIVIAN
      Yeah.

             DARLEEN
      I think this is a little girls 
      pageant.

REVEAL: Little girls and toddlers in jaw dropping amounts of 
make up and ridiculous, cheap sparkly dresses meander through 
the halls with their parents.

             VIVIAN
      Dont be silly.  Its for everyone. 
      There are three age groups.  This 
      is probably just the little ones 
      getting ready to go on first.

             DARLEEN
      Oh.
        (beat)
      What age group are you in?

INT. 4H INDOOR CARNIVAL - SCHOOL AUDITORIUM STAGE - LATER

BRYTNEE ANDREWS, 12, twirls on the stage in a way-too-short-
for-her-own-good mini dress.

The PAGEANT ANNOUNCER (who likely also ran the cattle auction 
earlier), is in her 50s, has a bad frizzy hair-do and is 
sporting waist high, pocket-less dungarees.

             ANNOUNCER
      Brytnee is twelve years old and a 
      sixth grader. Her three favorite 
      things in the world are Justin 
      Bieber, Spaghetti Os and Jesus.  
      When she grows up she wants to be a 
      Mommy, a wife and a part time hair 
      stylist.  Brytnee Andrews everyone!

BRYTNEES MOM, late 20s and a meth-addict with few remaining 
teeth shouts from the meager crowd.

             BRYTNEES MOM
      WORK IT BABY GIRL! YOU GO BRYTNEE! 
      SHOW THE JUDGES WHAT YOUR MOMMA 
      GAVE YOU!

The PANEL OF JUDGES, comprised of CREEPY OLD RANCHERS take 
notes.

INT. BACKSTAGE - SAME TIME

Vivian, a ball of nerves, paces back and forth in her 1994, 
purple, puffy sleeve prom dress.

ON THE STAGE:

             ANNOUNCER
      Our next and last contestant in the 
      twelve and up category is Vivian 
      Huntsman!  

Vivian walks out onto the stage.  Shes clearly embarrassed 
but steadfast in her determination to win.  

Awkward really doesnt even cover it.

             ANNOUNCER 
      Vivian is thirty six years old.  
      Her three favorite things are her 
      kids, Raisin Bran and the internet.  
      When she grows up...
        (awkward pause, silence)
      She wants to be just like Diane 
      Sawyer.

Brytnees Mom thrusts her fist in the air (like any meth 
addict mother would).

             BRYTNEES MOM
      THIS AINT RIGHT!  THAT FUGLY OLD 
      BITCH IS OLDER THAN ME!

             DARLEEN
        (yells)
      GO VIVIAN!

             BRYTNEES MOM
        (to Darleen)
      ILL PUNCH YOU IN THE FACE BITCH!  
      ILL PUNCH YOU IN THE FUCKING FACE!

The equally METH ADDICTED MAN with Brytnees Mom holds her 
back from climbing the chairs to get to Darleen.

Darleen looks around, surveying the scene.

             DARLEEN
        (to herself)
      Dont do it Darleen.

Darleen stands up, with gusto.

             DARLEEN 
        (still to herself)
      And Im doing it.
        (to Brytnees Mom)
      ILL PUNCH YOU IN THE FUCKING FACE 
      BITCH!

Fearful, Brytneess Mom sits down, silent.

             DARLEEN 
        (to herself)
      Well that worked better than I 
      thought it would.

ON THE STAGE:

             ANNOUNCER
      Thank you Vivian.  Next up swimwear 
      and crowning!  But first well have 
      a look at some prize winners from 
      earlier today!

A GIRL comes out with a BABY GOAT, which POOPS on the stage 
and a BOY comes out with a BABY PIG.  

MINUTES LATER:

Vivian, in a too-matronly-for-her-age ONE PIECE bathing suit 
and Brytnee in a SUPER SLUTTY SEQUINED STRING BIKINI, stand 
on stage. 

             ANNOUNCER 
      Before we announce the big winner, 
      well announce the Miss Fuzzy Bunny 
      award for the contestant with the 
      fuzziest, nicest personality.  And 
      that goes to... VIVIAN HUNTSMAN!

A BOY IN A WHEELCHAIR rolls out, very slowly, to present 
Vivian with her prize of A BABY BUNNY IN A CARDBOARD CAGE and 
A HEADBAND WITH SPARKLY BUNNY EARS.  

Vivian accepts the bunny graciously and puts the bunny ears 
on her head.

IN THE AUDIENCE:

Darleen tries desperately to quell her laughter as she takes 
a photo of Vivian.
BACK TO:

             ANNOUNCER
      Ok, everybody!  I know were 
      gettin anxious to get on over to 
      the pig roast next door, does that 
      barbecue smell good or what!  So 
      with no further ado,  the winner, 
      of this years 4H Indoor Carnival 
      Pageant is...
        (takes a moment to 
         process)
      BRYTNEE ANDREWS!

Crestfallen, Vivian smiles graciously.

Brytnee takes center stage. The ANNOUNCER places a small, 
plastic TIARA on her head and hands her a bouquet of grocery 
store daisies with the NEON $3.99 price tag clearly visible.

INT. THE LUMBERYARD BAR - LATER

Vivian and Darleen are bellied up to the old, hole-in-the-
country-wall bar.    

             VIVIAN
      I cant believe I lost to a twelve 
      year old girl.  

Darleen places her hand on Vivians back, lovingly.

             DARLEEN
      Viv. You didnt lose.  You won Miss 
      Fuzzy Bunny! That is extremely 
      prestigious.

They both crack up.

             DARLEEN 
        (through her laughter)
      I think I actually risked my life 
      tonight cheering for you. You know  
      my Momma always told me not to 
      fight with people with less teeth 
      than I do fingers and looking at 
      that woman, I know why she said 
      that.

             VIVIAN
      Well, I gave it my darn best.

             DARLEEN
      Id cheers to that but we dont 
      have drinks! I hear the new 
      bartender here is cute.  Hes an 
      adopted son of that big Mormon 
      family that has that ranch down by 
      the creek.
        (whispers)
      Hes Mexican.

             VIVIAN
      Darleen, you gotta stop that! Its 
      not like its a secret hes 
      Mexican.

The BARTENDER, indeed both cute and Mexican, comes up to the 
ladies.

             BARTENDER
      What can I get you ladies tonight?

             DARLEEN
      Peach schnapps, neat.

Vivian hesitates.

             DARLEEN 
      You are the current reigning Miss 
      Fuzzy Bunny of the 4H!  This is 
      something to celebrate.

Darleen plops Vivians sparkly bunny ears on her head. 

             VIVIAN
      Fine. Make it two.

             DARLEEN
      Now, thats what Im talking about.

             VIVIAN
        (laughs to herself)
      What am I even thinking.  Mrs. 
      Married America?  
        (sighs)
      Right?  I mean, you dont think I 
      should do it, do you?  Go for it?  
      Just tell me Im being crazy. 
      Clearly I need to hear it.

             DARLEEN
      Honestly?  


Vivian isnt sure she wants to hear the answer.
             DARLEEN 
      I think you can do anything you 
      want to do.
        (then)
      Only problem with you is, you gotta 
      believe it first.

             VIVIAN
      It says if I get in I have to have 
      a talent. 
        (thinking)
      I dont have any talents.  I mean I 
      took piano lessons when I was nine. 
      But thats it.

             DARLEEN
      Just tape record Leonard for an 
      hour and then tell everyone you 
      live with him everyday.
        (then)
      Now, THAT is a talent.

             VIVIAN
        (half-laughs)
      You know he wasnt always such...

             DARLEEN
      An asswipe?

             VIVIAN
      Yeah, that.  I mean was he ever a 
      prince charming?  No.  But back in 
      high school, he had such a big 
      heart.  He handled me getting 
      pregnant with Luke like a real man. 
      But then...
        (beat)
      Its like each day he just got a 
      tiny bit more angry at the world 
      and now, thats all he is.  Angry.  
      At me, the kids, the car.  The back 
      door.

The bartender slings their schnapps and slides them down the 
bar.

             DARLEEN
      Tonight isnt about him.  

Darleen clinks Vivians glass.


             DARLEEN 
      Its about you.  Bottoms up!

EXT. LUMBERYARD BAR PARKING LOT - MANY DRINKS LATER

Darleen and Vivian make their way out of the bar.  Darleen is 
shit canned and Vivian is well on her way.  

Just as they walk out, DR. RYAN TAYLOR, late thirties, 
handsome local dentist, is on his way in.

 
             VIVIAN
     Ryan!

             RYAN
      Vivian?  


Ryan is as shocked as he is happy to see her.

             RYAN 
      Wow, wasnt expecting to run into 
      you here.

             VIVIAN
      Yeah, I dont get out much.

             RYAN
      Hows the tooth we did the root 
      canal on feeling?

             VIVIAN
      Its perfect.  All the pain is 
      gone.
        (smiles)
      Thanks again for giving me such a 
      great deal.

             RYAN
      Anytime.
        (re: bunny ears)
      Celebrating Halloween a little late 
      this year?

Embarrassed, Vivian quickly takes them off.

             VIVIAN
      Forgot I had them on. I was just in 
      a beauty pageant.  Just a small one 
      next county over.  But Im tryin 
      to be in a bigger one. I won a pet 
      rabbit but I gave it away.
        (beat)
      Kinda stupid, right?

             RYAN
      Well, Im not surprised you won.

             VIVIAN
      I didnt exactly win but thank you. 
        (nervous)
      Well, we should go.
        (looks around)
      Right Darleen?
        (shouts out, looks around 
         more)
      Darleen?
        (horrified)
      DARLEEN!  

REVEAL: Darleen squatted down peeing behind a dumpster, not 
nearly as inconspicuous as she thinks.

             VIVIAN 
      What are you doing!

             DARLEEN
      No more toilet paper inside!

             VIVIAN
      Well, theres none out here either!

             DARLEEN
      Now that is a good point!

Darleen cracks up and FALLS OVER.

             RYAN
      Maybe I should give you guys a ride 
      home.

             VIVIAN
      Were fine.

             DARLEEN
        (shouts over)
      I ALMOST FELL IN MY OWN PEE!  BUT I 
      DIDNT.  DONT WORRY!  I DIDNT!

INT. RYANS TRUCK - MINUTES LATER

Ryan is at the wheel, all three of them squished in the front 
cab of his truck.  Their big winter coats taking up nearly 
every available inch.

             VIVIAN
      Its freezing out there!


             DARLEEN
      I need to go on vacation where its 
      hot as Hades.  

             RYAN
      If you dig a hole deep enough you 
      can go to Kerguelen Island.

Vivian and Darleen look at him, confused.

             RYAN 
      You guys dont know we live on an 
      antipode?

             DARLEEN
      Sounds like somethin a doctor 
      would stick up your ass.

             VIVIAN
      Dar!

             RYAN
      We here in little ole Rudyard 
      Montana have the distinction of 
      being the only people in the entire 
      United Stated that have the 
      pleasure of living on an antipode, 
      where there is something directly 
      below us that isnt water.  
      Kerguelen Island. Its somewhere in 
      the Indian Ocean.

             VIVIAN
      I think I heard about that in 
      school and forgot about it.  Like 
      everything else. 

             DARLEEN
      Well, we should go there. Hank and 
      Ive been saving forever for some 
      kind of vacation.  Be the perfect 
      excuse to break out my thong 
      bikini.

Vivian and Ryan laugh.

             DARLEEN 
        (dead serious)
      I look better in a thong than youd 
      think.

They pull in front of Darleens house and she hops out.

             DARLEEN 
      All I know is, I hope Hanks up.  

She rolls her hips feeling groovy and sexy.

             DARLEEN 
      Cause I feel like some action! 
        (sings, ala Marvin Gaye)
      Lets get it on.

             VIVIAN
      You are somethin else.

MINUTES LATER:

Ryan and Vivian are alone in his truck.  Its quiet and 
awkward and you could cut the sexual tension with a knife.

             RYAN
      Shes a piece of work that Darleen.   
      Hasnt changed a bit since high 
      school.

             VIVIAN
      Dont know what Id do without her.

Vivian looks at Ryan and smiles.

             RYAN
      Youve changed a little.  You used 
      to be vivacious Vivi!  Always 
      looking for lifes next great 
      adventure!

Vivian smiles and puts her sparkly bunny ears on her head.  
They both break into a much needed but quiet laughter.

Feeling too silly, she peels them back off.

             VIVIAN
      Life sure has a way of making you 
      change even when you dont want to.

A heavy moment passes. 

             VIVIAN 
      Im sorry about Laura.  I couldnt 
      bring myself to come to the 
      funeral.  


             RYAN
      It was a horrible time in my life. 
      Im not over it, dont get me 
      wrong.  But its been a few years 
      and I feel ok about it now.  It was 
      too soon for sure but it wasnt 
      then versus never, you know?  

             VIVIAN
      Yeah.

EXT. FRONT OF VIVIANS HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

Vivian and Ryan sit for a moment in the parked car.

             VIVIAN
      Well, I should get in.  I havent 
      been out this late in I dont know 
      how long.  House is probably a 
      disaster.

             RYAN
      Good night, Vivi.

             VIVIAN
      Good night, Ryan.

Without a kiss, a hug or even a shake goodbye, Vivian hops 
out of his truck and waves goodbye.

EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Vivian turns the key, quietly and tip toes into the house.

INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Desperate not to wake anyone, Vivian sneaks in.  Leonard is 
awake in the living room, beer in hand, several empties 
littered on the floor around him.

             LEONARD
      Well, there she is.  How was the 
      PTA meeting?  

             VIVIAN
      Leonard!  What are you doing up?

             LEONARD
      Waitin for the celebrity 
      appearance.

             VIVIAN
      What are you talking about?

Leonard gets up and steps face to face with Vivian.  He grabs 
her ass and talks into the deep of her ear.

             LEONARD
      Its a small town Vivian. You lied 
      to me.

Vivian doesnt say a word. 

             LEONARD 
      What the hell are you doin in a 
      beauty pageant anyway?

             VIVIAN
      No reason.  Just for fun.

             LEONARD
      Heard you almost won.  
        (laughs in her face)
      Dont get me wrong.  You were hot 
      when you were young. Remember 
      fuckin in the back of my truck?  
      You were all pretty and tight down 
      there.  
        (Mr. Macho)
      I got you pregnant the first time.  
        (stumbles onto her)
      Takes a man to make a man.

He sticks his hand up her shirt.

             VIVIAN
      Youre drunk Leonard. Stop it.

Leonard grabs her crotch and kisses her neck.

             LEONARD
      I aint fucked a beauty queen 
      before.  Now I got one in my own 
      house.

Vivian sees ALL OF THE KIDS STANDING IN THE HALLWAY and 
pushes Leonard away.

INT. DINING ROOM TABLE - A WEEK LATER

Vivian folds a WRITTEN ESSAY and slides a PHOTO OF HERSELF 
FROM THE 4H CARNIVAL PAGEANT into her finished application 
packet and seals it.

INT. POST OFFICE - AFTERNOON  

Vivian cradles the application package in her hands.

             VIVIAN
        (to herself)
      Dear Jesus.  If you ever wanna do 
      me right?  This is the way.

She opens the lever door on the mailbox and tosses it in.

FADE THROUGH A SERIES OF DAYS:

-- Filled with anxious hope, Vivian CHECKS THE MAILBOX AT THE 
END OF THE DRIVEWAY.  She pulls out a stack of junk mail and 
bills.

-- Still brimming with hope, Vivian checks the mailbox.  Its 
empty.  She looks at the paper still laying in the driveway 
and realizes its Sunday.

-- Vivian waits at the mailbox for the POSTMAN.  He hands her 
a meager stack of more junk mail and bills.

INT. HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

Vivian is in her pajamas, eating Raisin Bran.  

Another day. 

Same reality.  

Theres a knock at the front door, she sprints to get it.

I/E. FRONT DOOR -CONTINUOUS

Vivian opens the door to a FED EX DELIVERY MAN standing on 
her steps with a large envelope in hand.

             FED EX DELIVERY MAN
      Vivian Huntsman?

             VIVIAN
      Thats me!

He hands her the envelope.  Its from the MRS. MARRIED 
AMERICA PAGEANT.

             FED EX DELIVERY MAN
      Have a good day, mam.

             VIVIAN
      You too.

BACK INSIDE.

Vivian sits down on the couch and takes a deep breath.  She 
opens the envelope.  

Cautious.  Doubtful.  Desperate.

Reactionless, she reads the letter inside and then folds it 
back up and places it in the envelope.

EXT. DARLEENS HOUSE - MINUTES LATER 

Darleen opens her front door to find Vivian, STILL IN HER 
PAJAMAS.

             VIVIAN
      IM GOING!

             DARLEEN
        (re: her pajamas)
      Where?  To Crazytown in your 
      Crazymobile?

Vivian pulls the letter from Mrs. Married America from her 
pocket.

             DARLEEN 
      NO! 

             VIVIAN
      Yes mam!
        (huge smile)
      Wanna come?  Its in VEGAS!

             DARLEEN
      Well of course I do.  
        (without hesitation)
      But what did Leonard say?

             VIVIAN
      Nothing!

Darleen looks at her suspiciously.

             VIVIAN 
      Because I didnt tell him yet.  I 
      will. Im just too damn happy to 
      think about that right now!


Darleen gives Vivian a huge hug.  The two of them jump up and down and cheer in ecstatic union.  

Darleen stops and looks Vivian dead in the eyes.

             DARLEEN
      Im really proud of you, Viv.

             VIVIAN
      Thanks.
        (smiles)
      I think Im proud of me too.

INT. KITCHEN - DINNER TIME

Vivian, a bit more dolled up than normal and looking very 
nervous, piles the last of SEVERAL TYPES OF ROASTED GAME MEAT 
onto a huge platter and carries it out to the family.

AT THE TABLE:

The kids dig into the food and Leonard looks quite pleased.

             LEONARD
      Now, this is a supper!

Leonard piles his plate with meat and potatoes.

             VIVIAN
      So, I got a letter from the Mrs. 
      Married America pageant today!

             LEONARD
      The Mrs. What?

             VIVIAN
      Mrs. Married America.  A beauty 
      pageant for married ladies.

             LUKE
      Like peoples Moms nstuff?  Who 
      would watch that?

             LEONARD
      Nobody is who.

             VIVIAN
      Anyway, they want me to be in it!

Leonard looks up from his plate and stares at Vivian.

             LEONARD
      Why the hell they want you in it?  
      Howd they even know who you were?

             VIVIAN
      Well, I sent in an application.

Silence blankets the room.

             VIVIAN 
      And they chose me!  Can you believe 
      it?  All I have to do is get a few 
      things together, dresses and stuff 
      and get myself to Vegas but I 
      figure I can get that all worked 
      out somehow.

Vivians nerves set in.  She instantly starts to backpedal.

             VIVIAN 
      You know, on second thought.  Its 
      just too crazy an idea.  Forget I 
      even brought it up. I dont even 
      know what I was thinking.

More silence fills the air.

             LEONARD
      Better not cost us a dime.  Not a 
      red penny.
        (then)
      And make sure your Aunt Jeannie 
      comes and keeps after the kids so I 
      can get some huntin in.

Vivian bites her lip desperate to contain the bursting 
excitement shes feeling.

INT. DINING ROOM - DAY

Vivian reads through the letter from the pageant outlining 
everything shell need.

             VIVIAN
        (reads)
      Most contestants get local sponsors 
      to cover fees and expenses. 
        (thinks)
      Local sponsors?

She looks up and sees Summer standing beside her.

             VIVIAN 
      This is gonna be a lot harder than 
      I thought.

Summer rests her hand on Vivians shoulder.

             SUMMER
      Lifes a lot harder than I thought.

EXT. DOWNTOWN RUDYARD - DAY

Its a postage stamp of a western town, with a clearly 
depressed economy.

INT. RUDYARD HARDWARE - SAME TIME

Vivian, wearing a suit and carrying various pageant 
materials, smiles brightly. Shes just finished her pitch to 
the SHOP OWNER (60S, cheerful ole chap).

             HARDWARE SHOP OWNER
      Well, Id love to help!

He opens the register, grabs five dollars and hands it to 
Vivian.

             VIVIAN
        (as polite as possible)
      Thank you!

             HARDWARE SHOP OWNER
      And my MeeMaw can help you learn a 
      song on the piano, shes taught in 
      Rudyard for over seventy years!

Vivian looks behind the counter and sees MEEMAW, A 
BREATHTAKINGLY OLD WOMAN in a chair, half asleep.

             VIVIAN
      Yep!  She taught me when I was 
      nine.  

INT. RUDYARD LADIES WEAR SHOP - MINUTES LATER

Vivian walks in the local ladies wear shop.  Its a tiny, 
dusty time warp.


             VIVIAN      Hi Betty! I wanted to see if you 
      might be interested in sponsoring 
      me for my pageant?

SWING TO:

BETTY (70S, smoking a cigarette, blueish bouffant hair).

             BETTY
      Of course sweetie!  

Excited, Vivian takes out her clipboard ready for her pitch.

             BETTY 
        (before Vivian says 
         another word)
      Take your pick!

Vivian smiles as best she can as she looks over to the measly 
rack of horrendously dated dresses.

INT. RUDYARD PET AND FEED - MINUTES LATER

Vivian looks at the PET AND FEED SHOP OWNER (50s, rancher 
mustache) quizzically.

             VIVIAN
      Thanks for your support!  I didnt 
      know you were a photographer!

             PET AND FEED SHOP OWNER
      Sure am!  Ill get you some real 
      great shots for your pageant.  Got 
      a studio right out back in the 
      shed!

EXT. DOWNTOWN RUDYARD - MINUTES LATER

Vivian looks up and down Main Street, crestfallen. 

INT. RUDYARD FAMILY DENTISTRY - SAME TIME

Ryan looks out of the window of his office and sees Vivian. 

EXT. DOWNTOWN RUDYARD - MINUTES LATER

Vivian heads for her mini-van.


             RYAN      Vivian!

She turns around, surprised.  

             VIVIAN

      Ryan! 
        (calms herself)
      Hi. 

             RYAN
      Just wanted to see how your tooth 
      was feeling.
        (nervous)
      Again.

             VIVIAN
      Great! Really great. Even better 
      than before it hurt!

Vivian laughs, embarrassed at her obviously nonsensical 
comment.  Ryan looks at her clipboard full of pageant info.

             VIVIAN 
        (embarrassed)
      Oh. Just that silly pageant I was 
      thinking about doing.

             RYAN
      Doesnt sound one bit silly to me.

Their eyes connect for a moment but Vivian quickly changes 
gears, nervous.

             VIVIAN
      Well, I should go.  Need to get the 
      kids from the bus stop.

             RYAN
        (re: pageant stuff)
      Good luck with all of that.  I 
      think its really great youre 
      pursuing your dreams.  The older we 
      get, the harder than can be to do.

             VIVIAN
        (all smiles)
      Thanks.

INT. BATHROOM - MORNING

Vivian is on her hands and knees scrubbing the family toilet. 
Theres a KNOCK AT THE FRONT DOOR. 

I/E. FRONT DOOR - SECONDS LATER

OLLY the local POSTMAN (60s, ruddy cheeks) hands Vivian a 
letter that she has to sign for.

             OLLY THE POSTMAN
      Must be important.  Sent certified!

             VIVIAN
      Thanks Olly!

INSIDE:

Vivian RIPS OPEN the Envelope.  Inside is a check for FIVE 
HUNDRED DOLLARS and a congratulatory letter from the CITY OF 
RUDYARD CHAMBER OF COMMERCE for her pageant participation.

At the bottom of the letter is a list of local businesses in 
the chamber.  RUDYARD FAMILY DENTISTRY IS RIGHT DAB SMACK AT 
THE TOP.

             VIVIAN
        (to herself)
      Ryan Taylor, what did you do?

MOMENTS LATER:

Vivian, on the phone, paces back and forth as the other end 
rings and rings.  Her heart nearly stops when the other line 
picks up.

             WOMANS VOICE 
      Patty Lane, Mrs. Married America 
      Nineteen Ninety Nine, how may I 
      help you?

Vivian fans her face to calm her nerves. 

             VIVIAN
      Hi, my name is Vivian Huntsman from 
      Montana.  Im calling to let you 
      know Ive officially raised all of 
      me fees and Im coming to Vegas!

             PATTY LANE
      Well, that is wonderful news!  
      Welcome to the Mrs. Married America 
      family!

             VIVIAN
      Thank you very much.  I am so 
      honored to have been chosen.

             PATTY LANE
      Well Vivian, well look forward to 
      meeting you and your hubby in Las 
      Vegas!  What did you say his name 
      was?

             VIVIAN
      Im sorry, did you say my husband?

             PATTY LANE
      Why yes of course!  This is Mrs. 
      Married America.  What goods a 
      wife without her husband there?

Vivian is shell shocked and crestfallen.

             VIVIAN
      Right!  Of course.  What was I 
      thinking.  His name is Leonard. The 
      both of us will be there.  
        (total b.s.)
      We cant wait!  

             PATTY LANE
      See you at the pageant!  

INT. DEN - AFTERNOON

Vivian does her best to hold it together as she walks away 
from Leonard.  Hes clearly just broken her heart and told 
her hes not going to come.

EXT. DARLEENS HOUSE - LATER   

Vivian, in tears, knocks on Darleens door.  Darleen opens 
the door and gives her a motherly, loving hug.

INT. RUDYARD FAMILY DENTISTRY - A WHILE LATER 

Vivian tries to hand the check back to Ryan.

             RYAN
      Keep it.  Even if you dont cash 
      it.  Just keep it.

Vivian smiles meekly, sad but appreciative of his gesture.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Vivian, swollen eyes and a sunken heart puts THE LETTERS FROM 
THE PAGEANT AND THE CHECK FROM THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE INTO 
HER WHAT COULDA BEEN BOX.  She puts the box on the shelf 
and closes the closet door.

EXT. CATTLE RANCH - DAY

Darleen pulls up beside a large cattle ranch in her 1997 F-
150.

OUT IN THE FIELD:

Leonard, tossing bails of hay onto the field from an old pick 
up truck, is startled to see Darleen.

             DARLEEN
      Hey Leonard!

             LEONARD
      Darleen.  What are you doing here?

Darleen hands Leonard an envelope.

             LEONARD 
      Whats this?

             DARLEEN
      Its a plane ticket.  To Vegas.  

Leonard looks at the ticket and tries to hand it back.

             LEONARD
      I aint goin to no beauty pageant. 
      But thanks.

With a robust and cocky smile, Darleen refuses to take it 
back.

             DARLEEN
      Oh youre going.  You know how I 
      know youre going?

Leonard looks at her, taken aback and curious.

             DARLEEN 
      I know youre going because if you 
      dont?  Ill spend all the money I 
      got puttin up a big ole billboard 
      that says Leonard Huntsman gets 
      drunk and cant get it up.

             DARLEEN 
        (then)
      Viva Las Vegas Baby.

Darleen walks away, leaving a stunned and speechless Leonard.

EXT. DRIVEWAY - SUNRISE

Vivian rolls down the window and WAVES TO THE KIDS AND 
LEONARD as she and Darleen drive away in Darleens pick-up, 
which is packed full of pageant wear and duffle bags.

             VIVIAN
        (shouts out to them)
      BYE GUYS!  I LOVE YOU!!!

INT. DARLEENS PICK-UP - CONTINUOUS

Vivian looks back and waves one last time as they pull away, 
all four kids waving good-bye.

             VIVIAN
      Darleen, I dont know what you said 
      to him but I could tell you thank 
      you every day for the rest of my 
      life until I died and it wouldnt 
      cover how much I appreciate that 
      you got him to come.  

             DARLEEN
      Never tried so hard to get someone 
      I cant stand to come to something 
      in my life.

             VIVIAN
        (big smiles)
      We are on the road baby!  MRS. 
      MARRIED AMERICA HERE WE COME!

EXT. WIDE OPEN COUNTRY - DARLEENS PICK-UP - DAY INTO NIGHT

Vivian and Darleen wind through MONTANA.

The red rocks of UTAH.

The hot desert plains of NEVADA.

I/E. CIRCUS CIRCUS HOTEL - DARLEENS PICK UP- LATE NIGHT

They pull into the cheesy, dated Vegas strip hotel.  

             VIVIAN
      Were here!  I cant believe it!
        (looks around in awe)
      Its beautiful. 

Darleen looks up to the TOWERING CIRCUS CIRCUS SIGN. ITS A 
LARGE CREEPY CLOWN.

             DARLEEN
        (horrified)
      Yeah if youre not scared to death 
      of clowns. Why do all clowns have 
      to look so evil! 
        (looks away, panicked)
      SO GOD DAMN EVIL!

INT. CHECK IN - CIRCUS CIRCUS HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER 

Vivian and Darleen wait as a WOMAN AND HER HUSBAND in front 
of them are helped.  The woman has at least ten pieces of 
KNOCK-OFF LOUIS VUITTON LUGGAGE beside her.  Her nails long 
and red, her hair perfectly done.

             WOMAN
      Im here with the pageant. Amberr 
      with a double R Lakes, the second R 
      is silent.  AKA Mrs. Texas! 

She canoodles with her husband.

             FRONT DESK MANAGER
      Well, were glad to have you here 
      Mrs. Texas.  

His hands type furiously into the reservations computer.

             FRONT DESK MANAGER 
      I see youve booked our Golden Tent 
      Suite.
        (smiles, hands her a key)
      Dolly Parton once stayed in it.

             AMBERR
      I love me some Dolly!
        (then, to her husband)
      Thanks for letting me book such an 
      expensive suite.

Amberr turns around, wearing a SWAROVSKY CRYSTAL PIN SHAPED 
LIKE THE STATE OF TEXAS and a bitchy snarl of a smile.  The 
scratched red of her Louboutin's flipping up with every step 
as she walks away.

             FRONT DESK MANAGER
      Next!

Vivian and Darleen approach the front desk.  The Front Desk 
Manager eyes them with incurious judgement.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - CIRCUS CIRCUS - CONTINUOUS

Darleen and Vivian walk into the room.  Its likely one of 
the least impressive rooms in the entire hotel.  

Vivian is really excited about it.

             VIVIAN
      Its like Ive died and gone to 
      hotel heaven!

Vivian runs to the bed on the far side of the room and sits 
on it, taking it all in.

She smiles and grabs a PHOTO OF DIANE SAWYER from her purse 
and tapes it to the wall just above her bed.

INT. BATHROOM - LATER

The shower running, the bathroom filled with steam.  Vivian, 
in a towel, wipes a circle clear in the mirror and stares 
into her own reflection.  

She smiles and waves to the crowd, one hand over her heart 
in a mark of sincerity.

             VIVIAN
      I cant believe I won!  Thank you 
      everyone for choosing me as Mrs. 
      Married America. This is the 
      greatest honor I could ever imagine 
      for myself.  Thank you, thank you, 
      thank you!

SMASH TO:

EXT. CIRCUS CIRCUS HOTEL - BALLROOM - MORNING

A welcome sign beside the door reads:

WELCOME BREAKFAST FOR MRS. MARRIED AMERICA PAGEANT 
CONTESTANTS AND THEIR FAMILIES.

Vivian is BURSTING with excitement.

INT. CIRCUS CIRCUS HOTEL - BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS

Vivian and Darleen head for the CHECK IN TABLE.   

Vivian is mesmerized by all of the other PAGEANT CONTESTANTS 
checking in, she is among the most modest and BY FAR the 
palest.

             VIVIAN
        (under her breath to 
         Darleen)
      Everybodys so tan!

AT THE CHECK IN TABLE:

A SUPER BITCHY WOMAN is in charge of sign ins at the table.

             VIVIAN 
      Hi there! Im Vivian Huntsman, Mrs. 
      Montana.

             WOMAN AT THE CHECK IN TABLE
      Heres your name tags, sign the 
      check in sheet over there.

Vivian grabs her name tag from the check in table, her 
HORRIBLE photo from the Rudyard Pet and Feed Photographer is 
on it.  Shes WEARING A BIKINI AND A COWBOY HAT AND SITTING 
ON AN OLD SADDLE. 

Vivian looks at the other photos on the name tags, they tend 
more toward local realtor vs. Vivians which tends more 
toward local hooker.

             SUPER BITCHY WOMAN
      Nice photo!  So... 
        (cutting, petty pause)
      ...professional.

             VIVIAN
        (happy and oblivious)
      Thank you!  

Attached is also a name tag that says Leonard Huntsman she 
hands it to Darleen.  

             DARLEEN
        (whispers to Vivian)
      Are you sure Im supposed to be 
      here?

             VIVIAN
      It said family could come.
        (smiles)
      And you are family.

             DARLEEN
      Well, then lets do this.  Oh, 
      except one thing.  

Darleen grabs a pen from the desk, scribbles out Leonard and 
writes Darleen.

             DARLEEN 
      I know hes your husband but Id 
      rather gouge my eyes out with a 
      blunt butter knife at a slow 
      painful pace than wear his name 
      tag.

Vivian doesnt bat an eye at Darleens comment.  She looks 
out to the large bustling banquet room FILLED WITH 
CONTESTANTS AND THEIR FAMILIES.

             VIVIAN
        (without hesitation)
      Lets go find table six!

MOMENTS LATER, AT TABLE SIX:

It is stone cold silent. Everyone has their eyes glued to 
Vivian and Darleen.  They are all very confused.

MRS. IOWA, 40s, potentially leading a double life as a 
lesbian, finally speaks up.

             MRS. IOWA
      I didnt realize it was legal in 
      Montana.

             VIVIAN
      What?

MRS. UTAH, 19, blonde hair, cherub faced wife and likely 
still a virgin.

             MRS. UTAH
        (meek, scared)
      Lady lady marriages.

             VIVIAN
        (confused)
      Oh, you mean us?

             DARLEEN
      Were not LESBOS! Not that theres 
      anything wrong with being a LESBO! 
      Were just not LESBOS!

             VIVIAN
        (under her breath)
      Darleen!  Why are you yelling?

             DARLEEN
        (also under her breath)
      You said to stop whispering things 
      so Im over-correcting for awhile 
      until I get it right.  

Vivian smiles nervously, the entire room seems to have 
quieted in on their conversation.

PATTY LANE, the director of the pageant, 50s and a violent 
mix of Botox, Restylane and Juvederm, takes the podium. 

             PATTY LANE
      Good morning everyone!  Welcome!  I 
      am Patty Lane director of the Mrs. 
      Married America pageant. Where we 
      celebrate and honor the AMERICAN 
      MARRIED WOMAN!

Roaring cheers flow through the room.

             PATTY LANE 
      I believe in the power of marriage 
      because it is a power sent to us 
      directly from the good Lord above.  

Patty points up to the ceiling, robustly.  More applause 
echoes through the room.

             PATTY LANE 
      I also believe in the bible.  And 
      in the bible it says Eve came from 
      Adams rib.  A lot of women in 
      these modern, end of days times, 
      say they have a problem with this 
      idea.  With this concept. You know 
      what I say?  Comin from a rib is 
      not a bad thing.
        (smiles)
      I live in Texas and let me tell you 
      I have had some delicious ribs!

Even MORE applause.


             PATTY LANE 
      I look out at this room and I get a 
      little misty eyed.  Seeing you all 
      here with your families.  Your 
      support network.  Your handsome 
      hubbies!  This...

Patty Lane gestures to the room.

             PATTY LANE 
      THIS is America.  This is what we 
      are about. Family. God.
        (smiles)
      And BEAUTY PAGEANTS!  Look around 
      ladies.  Look to your right, to 
      your left, across the table, across 
      the room.

Everyone looks around at each other.

             PATTY LANE 
      Mrs. Married America two thousand 
      and thirteen is in here somewhere!  
      Thats right.  Shes in this very 
      room!  Congratulations to all of 
      you and may the best wife win!

Everyone rises to give Patty Lane a standing ovation.

CUT TO:

TABLE SIX:

Darleen and Vivian stand and clap with everyone else.

             DARLEEN
      I feel like that thing about the 
      rib was kinda weird, right?

Vivian is too caught up in applause and excitement to hear 
her.

             DARLEEN 
      Like now all I can picture is that 
      lady is a cannibal.  

             VIVIAN
        (confused/just caught the 
         tail end)
      What?

EXT. POOL - CIRCUS CIRCUS - LATER

Darleen in a skirty-dress bathing suit and Vivian in a one 
piece, both horrifically pale and wearing sunglasses venture 
out to the COMPLETELY EMPTY pool area.

             VIVIAN
      Well, time to work on my tan!  I 
      cant believe the color brown some 
      of these people are. 

CUT TO:

TEN MINUTES LATER:

Darleen is bundled in several towels.  Vivian is in her 
bathing suit, tanning oiled up, sunglasses on.  

             DARLEEN
      You sure youre not cold?

             VIVIAN
        (lips almost blue, teeth 
         chattering)
      Nope! Im good.  So warm.  Balmy!

Darleen buries her face under yet another towel to shield 
from the cold.

INT. GOLDEN TENT SUITE - SAME TIME

The golden tent suite is exactly as gold, big and ridiculous 
as one might imagine. 

Amberr/Mrs. Texas, IN PASTIES AND A THONG, gets the finishing 
touches of her SPRAY TAN by her assistant DAVINE, a late 20s 
black man wearing leopard print leggings and platform heels.

             DAVINE
      Girl, you stay your ass still.  I 
      made you Africa dark so any streak 
      is gonna show like the dickens.

             AMBERR
      Thanks Davine.  Youre the best.

Waiting to dry off, Amberr peers out the window to the POOL 
AREA DOWN BELOW and sees Vivian and Darleen.

             AMBERR 
      Davine, you gotta come here.  You 
      are not gonna believe what Im 
      lookin at.

Davine comes over and looks out the window.

             DAVINE CONTD)
      Oh, child. Layin out in their 
      Walmart clothes in sixty degree 
      weather.

             AMBERR
      You know what they say.  You can 
      take the girl out of Montana.

             DAVINE/AMBERR
        (in evil unison)
      But you probably shouldnt!

INT. HALLWAY - LATER

Vivian paces back and forth as she listens to ring after ring 
on her phone.

             LEONARD 
      Hi, this is Leonard, leave a 
      message and Ill maybe call you 
      back.

             VIVIAN
      Hi, its me.  Just makin sure 
      youre all ready to get on that 
      plane tomorrow like you promised 
      you would.  I really need you to be 
      here.
        (deep breath)
      So see you soon.

INT. STAGE - CIRCUS CIRCUS - LATER

The contestants are gathered on the stage for rehearsal.  
Most are in sexy boy shorts and sports bras.

But not Vivian. 

Shes in gathered ankle sweats and an oversized T-shirt that 
says RUDYARD HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL ALL-STARS.  

Amberr is just one row up from her.

             AMBERR
        (shouts for everyone to 
         hear)
      Well, dont you look comfortable!

All eyes in ear shot, instantly cut to Vivian who smiles 
nervously. 

Patty leads the women in rehearsal. 

             PATTY LANE
      Ok ladies!  Grab your lyrics and 
      lets run through the song a few 
      times first before we add the 
      choreography!  Big smiles!

Patty CUES the PIANO PLAYER.  All of the women SING THE 
PAGEANT ANTHEM IN UNION.

             EVERYONE
      Im so proud to be an American! 
      So proud to be red, white and blue. 
      Im so proud to be married! 
      Because I know that love is true.  
      I make casseroles and change 
      diapers! 
      I lead a crazy busy life! 
      But Im proud most of all to say, 
      IM A WIFE!

The CONTESTANTS follow the CHOREOGRAPHER (a thirtysomething 
fierce and bitchy gay man with a faux-hawk).

LATER ON:

             CHOREOGRAPHER
      Five, six, seven, eight!

The women do their best to follow his moves.  Some great, 
some average and then Vivian.

Vivian has two left feet and almost trips over herself and 
anyone within a five foot radius around her.

Meanwhile, Amberr looks like shes the current reigning 
captain of the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders.

INT. AUDITORIUM SEATS -  AFTER REHEARSAL

The contestants are gathered in their seats as Patty 
addresses them.

             PATTY LANE
      Great job everyone!
        (smiles)
      Although God didnt grace us all 
      with the talent like he did Mrs. 
      Texas over there!  

Amberr scoots up a couple inches in her seat, so proud of 
herself.

             PATTY LANE 
      Tomorrow this room will be 
      filled...
        (aside)
      Well mostly filled, tickets are 
      still available at thirty five 
      dollars a piece for any of you that 
      may need or want them for family or 
      friends.
        (moving on)
      With people here to support you! 
      But they also want to be 
      entertained.  So work on those 
      steps tonight ladies!  And for one 
      of you, this will be your last 
      night going to bed as just a 
      regular wife because for one of 
      you, tomorrow you will be the new 
      Mrs. Married America!  

Everyone gathers their things.  Vivian and Amberr leave at 
the same time. 

             AMBERR
      I saw you and your friend laying 
      out by the pool earlier.  
        (insincere)
      Looks like it was lovely.

             VIVIAN
      It was a little chilly but I think 
      I got a tan.

Amberr and Vivian both look at Vivians arms.  She didnt get 
any sort of tan.

             VIVIAN 
      Youre a really great dancer!  You 
      must take a lot of classes.

             AMBERR
      Not really.  Like she said, God 
      given I guess.  

Amberr extends her hand, with a bitchy grin.

             AMBERR 
      Amberr. With a double R. The second 
      R is silent.

Vivian smiles.

             VIVIAN
      Vivian.  All the letters have a 
      sound.

Amberr raises an eyebrow at her quip.

             AMBERR
      So, Montana? Is this your first 
      pageant?

             VIVIAN
      No. Technically one other, a local 
      4H pageant just a few weeks ago. 
        (smiles, nervous)
      First runner up!

Amberr is transparently dismissive of everything Vivian is 
saying.

             AMBERR
      Isnt that cute.  Myself, well, Im 
      a lifelong title holder.  I even 
      won a pageant in utero when my 
      Momma won Miss Texas State Fair!  
      No one knew she was knocked up, 
      obviously.  Then I won twelve 
      before I could walk and I was 
      almost Miss Texas.  Third runner 
      up!  Once I got married I thought 
      my pageant days were over but no, 
      no, no!  Ive found plenty more to 
      win.  Nine to be exact.  This is my 
      first national married pageant 
      though.  Unlike Montana the 
      competition coming out of Texas is 
      incredibly fierce.  I won Mrs. 
      Chardonnay Hills right before I 
      came here.  Its the gated 
      community we live in.  All semi-
      custom homes.  Youd think itd be 
      a small pageant being just one 
      little subdivision but it was over 
      eighty women!  We even had a 
      celebrity judge.  Kirk Cameron.  
      Isnt he just the cutest!  


             AMBERR 
      I could just eat him up.  Well, 
      that is if my husband wasnt so hot 
      himself.

             VIVIAN
      Wow.  Thats a lot of pageants.  Do 
      you have kids?

             AMBERR
      Three daughters.  Makynzie, 
      Makynley and Makayla.  We have a 
      full time nanny and housekeeper to 
      make things easier while Mommy is 
      out being busy winning pageants!  
      The girls have a Daddy that likes 
      to keep all his ladies happy.

Amberr non-so-subtly flashes her EIGHT CARAT DIAMOND RING 
Vivians way.  Vivian, twists her Walmart purchased mini-
diamond wedding set to face the inside of her palm and 
smiles.

             VIVIAN
      Sounds like you sure hit the 
      jackpot!

             AMBERR
      I really feel like Jesus sent me 
      himself incarnate sometimes hes so 
      perfect.

             VIVIAN
      That would be weird.

             AMBERR
      What?

             VIVIAN
      If you were married to Jesus.

             AMBERR
        (miffed and confused)
      Well, we should get to our rooms!  
      Beauty sleep is essential if you 
      want to be a...

Amberr runs her eyes up and down Vivian, transparently 
unimpressed.

             AMBERR 
      ...winner.


INT. ELEVATOR - CIRCUS CIRCUS - LATER
Vivian, Amberr, MRS. OHIO (30s, mid-western and pretty) and 
MRS. NEBRASKA (late 20s, athletic and cheerful) are on the 
elevator.

             MRS. NEBRASKA
      My little girl has a cold and my 
      husband has been taking such great 
      care of her while weve been here.
      Dont you just love being married?  
      Husbands are the best!

             MRS. OHIO
      I know, my husband has been giving 
      me foot massages and even surprised 
      me last night by telling me that 
      when Im done with all this we can 
      start trying for baby number seven!  
      Hes such an amazing man, always 
      wants me to be happy!

             AMBERR
      Vivian, Ive noticed your husband 
      isnt here.  He is coming, right?

             VIVIAN
      Yes!  Of course hes coming.  Hes 
      just such a hard working man. 
      Didnt want to take more time off 
      from work than he needed too.  

             AMBERR
        (super fake)
      Oh, I am SO glad to hear that. 
        (then, to everyone)
      A little birdie told me that the 
      husband and wife portion of the 
      pageant weighs a lot more heavily 
      in the judging than youd think.  I 
      mean, it is after all what this is 
      all about.  Being a married woman, 
      right?

The elevator doors open, Amberr steps off.

             AMBERR 
      Speaking of husbands, Im gonna go 
      find that little hubby of mine for 
      some cuddle time!  Bye ladies!


INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER  
Vivian goes over her dance moves, still no where near getting 
them right. Darleen walks in, wearing a LAS VEGAS T-SHIRT and 
a FANNY PACK.


             DARLEEN
      I wanted to be a Solid Gold dancer 
      when I was little.

             VIVIAN
      This stupid dance we gotta do for 
      the pageant is going to be the 
      death of me.  Im awful.

             DARLEEN
      Im sure youre not awful.

             VIVIAN
      Trust me.
        (then)
      Whatve you been up to?

             DARLEEN
      Oh just out doing some sightseeing.  
      Wax museum, took a gondola ride at 
      the Venetian.  Just like Venice!
      Not that Ive ever been there but I 
      cant imagine how it could possibly 
      be more beautiful.

             VIVIAN
      Sounds nice.

             DARLEEN
        (re: her two left feet)
      Viv, its not a dance competition.  

             VIVIAN
      I know.  I just want everything to 
      be as perfect as I can make it.
      Seems like everybody here is a 
      professional dancer, always know 
      the perfect thing to say, they all 
      have these fancy stylists and hair 
      people and assistants.  

             DARLEEN
      Hey now, I went to cosmetology 
      school for a semester and a half.  

Vivian smiles.

             VIVIAN
        (convicted)
      All these other women, they really 
      want this. But me? I need this.  
      This is the only way I can ever 
      change my life!

Vivian looks over to the PHOTO OF DIANE SAWYER taped above 
her bed.

             VIVIAN 
      Be who I want to be.  If I dont 
      win tomorrow, Ive run out of 
      options.  Plain and simple.

             DARLEEN
      Viv, dont put that much pressure 
      on yourself.

             VIVIAN
      But its true.  I mean, what am I 
      gonna do? Move my whole family 
      somewhere so I can go to college 
      and get a degree in journalism?   
      Darleen, this is it.  This is my 
      one and only shot at getting 
      anywhere close to my dreams.

Vivians eyes gaze toward the sad dress she got from the 
local clothing shop, hanging on the back of the door.

             VIVIAN 
      I just have so much working against 
      me.  

Darleen doesnt know what to say.  Vivian does have a lot 
working against her.

             VIVIAN 
      Its weird, this feeling.  Needing 
      something so much you can almost 
      taste it.  Ive never felt this way 
      about anything.

             DARLEEN
      You know what?  I think you should 
      put those two left feet to work and 
      Im gonna go hunt down this crepe 
      place I saw over at the Paris 
      hotel.

             VIVIAN
      Are you sure?  I can practice 
      somewhere else.

             DARLEEN
      Im sure.  
        (smiles)
      You can work this out.  I know you 
      can.

             VIVIAN
      Thanks.

Darleen grabs her room key and heads out.

INT. CASINO - SAME TIME

Darleen walks through the casino, casing the various tables 
and machines.  

She watches a few rounds of Black Jack and sits at the table, 
lays a hundred dollars down and almost as quickly as she put 
it down, loses it.

Darleen finds a QUIET CORNER to make a call.

             DARLEEN
        (on the phone)
      Hey Hank, its me...no, 
      everythings ok.
        (then)
      I want to talk to you about that 
      money we have in the vacation fund?

INT. HOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME

Vivian, in front of the mirrored sliding closet doors, works 
on her dance.

She watches herself fail time after time.  Step after step.

INT. VERSACE STORE - MINUTES LATER

Darleen, in her Las Vegas T-shirt and fanny pack strolls 
through the store.  She is TOTALLY ignored by the snickering, 
ironically snotty sales staff.

A WEALTHY LOOKING WOMAN WITH A LITTLE DOG walks in and is 
instantly offered a glass of champagne from a silver tray.  

There are several glasses on the tray and they do not offer 
one to Darleen.

Darleen pulls A GORGEOUS BRIGHT PURPLE DRESS off the sale 
rack.

             DARLEEN
        (smiles)
      Like it was made for her.

EXT. HOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME

Vivian, on her phone, paces back and forth with each ring.

             SUMMER
      Hello?

             VIVIAN
      Summer!  Hey baby.  Hows 
      everything there?

             SUMMER
      Good.  I made dinner last night 
      because Aunt Jeannies food was too 
      yucky.

             VIVIAN
      It was? What did you make?

             SUMMER
      I made sloppy joes and then Im 
      making macaroni and cheese tonight.  
      From the box but Im adding frozen 
      peas for added flavor and 
      nutrition.

Vivian smiles.

             VIVIAN
      That sounds delicious.  Youll have 
      to make it for me when I come home.  
      Is Daddy there? Hes not pickin up 
      his phone.

             SUMMER
      No, hes out.

             VIVIAN
      Well, tell him I called and make 
      sure he packs and gets to the 
      airport tomorrow.

             SUMMER
      I will.

             VIVIAN
      I love you.

             SUMMER
      Love you too.  Oh and Mom?

             VIVIAN
      Yeah sweetie?

             SUMMER
      I know youre gonna win.  I just 
      know it.  

             VIVIAN
      Thanks baby girl.  

Vivian hangs up the phone and stares at the wall, unsure, 
uncertain.  

INT. VERSACE STORE - AT THE REGISTER - CONTINUOUS

Darleen hands the evening gown to the SNIFFY SALES ASSOCIATE, 
20s, gay, wearing eye liner.  

He is convinced shes there in ignorant error and makes that 
abundantly clear.

             SNIFFY SALES ASSOCIATE
      This dress is on sale but its 
      still twelve hundred dollars.  As 
      in one thousand two hundred 
      dollars.  

Darleen hands him cash.  Dumbstruck, he rings her up.

INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER 

Vivian looks into the mirror and waves. But this time as she 
smiles, its hollow.  Empty.  

For the first time, in a long time, Vivian crumbles, 
completely.  

INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Vivian crawls onto the bed and curls under the covers, 
weeping.

INT. VERSACE STORE - CONTINUOUS

The Sales Associate hands Darleen the dress in a garment bag.

             SNIFFY SALES ASSOCIATE
        (tries to repair)
      Thank you for shopping at Versace. 
      We hope to see you again very soon.

Darleen grabs the garment bag AND A GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE AND 
THE BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE from the tray.

             DARLEEN
      Fat chance fuck face.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER

Darleen walks in and finds Vivian, on the bed, in the fetal 
position and a puddle of tears.

A room service tray on the bed beside her.  A SMALL BOX OF 
RAISIN BRAN AND A WATER ON IT. Darleen lays the garment bag 
over the TV and sits beside Vivian on the bed.

             DARLEEN
      Viv?  

             VIVIAN
        (through her tears and 
         stuffy nose)
      Im fine, just a little stressed 
      out.

             DARLEEN
      Im sorry, are you speaking 
      bullshit?  Because thats a 
      language I dont understand.
        (loving)
      Tell me whats wrong.

             VIVIAN
      Im gonna let everyone down.
        (then)
      Im gonna let myself down.  Im 
      being a fool.  I dont belong here.  
      Not with all these happy people 
      with regular lives. 

             DARLEEN
      What are you talking about?  You 
      have just as good a chance as 
      anyone.

             VIVIAN
      Im not like these women.  Im not 
      prepared.  Im not polished, I 
      dont know what Im doing. 

             VIVIAN 
      Im just a boring housewife from 
      the middle of nowhere who had so 
      little interaction with the rest of 
      the world that I was able to kid 
      myself into thinking that I was 
      capable of doing something more.  
      Being something more.  

Vivian LOOKS AT THE PHOTO OF DIANE SAWYER above her bed.

             VIVIAN 
      Now that Im here, out of my safe 
      little bubble and around all these 
      other people its abundantly clear 
      who I am.
        (then)
      Who Im always going to be.

             DARLEEN
      I think youre right.

Vivian, surprised, looks back at Darleen.

             DARLEEN 
      If you keep thinking this way.  If 
      you keep putting so much pressure 
      on yourself.  This isnt the only 
      way you can make a difference in 
      your life.  Its your life and you 
      can do whatever the hell you want 
      with it.

             VIVIAN
      DARLEEN, YOU JUST DONT GET IT!  
      Youre too happy to get it!  You 
      dont know what it feels like to 
      live in a cage.  To wake up 
      everyday wondering why you bothered 
      to.  If it werent for my kids...
        (then)
      Youre one of the lucky ones.  
      Lucky people always think they know 
      how to fix everyone else.  Well 
      guess what?  You dont. So quit 
      trying.  Quit pretending you know 
      what Im going through because you 
      dont.  You have no god damn idea 
      what its like.

Darleen stands up and heads for the door.

             DARLEEN
      I guess I dont.

Darleen grabs the dress, hangs it up in the closet, and 
leaves.

Vivian lays quiet for a moment.  Static.  Cold.

SMASH TO:

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Vivian runs for the elevators.

             VIVIAN
      DARLEEN!  WAIT!

She sees Darleen in the elevator and gets to the doors just 
as they are about to close and thrusts her arm between them.

             VIVIAN 
      Im so sorry. I didnt mean what I 
      said... it wasnt fair... knowing 
      you could never... that youve 
      never...

             DARLEEN
      Had kids of my own?  
        (then, smiles)
      I know you didnt.

             VIVIAN
      Youre the best friend any girl 
      could have and some days I feel 
      like youre the Mom I never really 
      had.  I love you Darleen and I 
      thank god every damn day for you 
      cause I dont know where Id be if 
      you werent in my life.

             DARLEEN
      Youre not so bad yourself.  
        (smiles)
      Ill be right back.

             VIVIAN
      Where are you going?

             DARLEEN
      Just gonna run and grab something I 
      think might help take your mind of 
      things.

CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL GIFT SHOP - MOMENTS LATER

Darleen is in line with a GIGANTIC bottle of PEACH SCHNAPPS.

As she waits in line she sees AMBERR BUYING A BOTTLE OF WINE.

             DARLEEN
        (friendly)
      Night in with the husband?  Sure 
      miss mine.

Amberr looks at Darleen, the tears streaming from her overly 
made up eyes.

             DARLEEN 
      Oh, crap.  Not another one.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - MINUTES LATER 

Vivian answers a knock at the door.  Its Darleen....

... and AMBERR.

             VIVIAN
        (re: Amberr)
      What are you doing here?

Amberr raises her bottle of White Zin with teary eyes and a 
smile.

CUT TO:

THIRTY MINUTES LATER:

Amberr is a total wreck.  Mascara streaming down her face in 
a river of failure.

She takes a swig straight from the almost-empty-bottle of 
pink wine.

             AMBERR
      You wanna know the best part?

Vivian and Darleen look on in horror and nod.  

Amberr wipes the mascara river with her hand, spreading black 
all over her face.

             AMBERR 
      Hes already planning on marrying 
      the cunt.  The divorce was just 
      finalized last week and hes 
      already moving on. 

             AMBERR 
      So not only am I here like a total 
      fraud because were not even 
      married anymore but I got the joy 
      of overhearing them talking about 
      wedding flowers this morning while 
      I was taking a poop!    

             VIVIAN
      Im really sorry Amberr.  Thats 
      awful.

             DARLEEN
      Howd you get him to come here?

             AMBERR
      I told him Id sign the papers and 
      settle out of court if he came.
        (then)
      Yes, Im really that stupid.  I 
      gave up my house to be in a fucking 
      beauty pageant.

Amberr takes the last swig from her bottle and looks over to 
Vivian.

             AMBERR 
      Your husband cheat on you?

             VIVIAN
      Oh, I think hed love to. 
      But he gets so piss drunk I think 
      he forgets to actually do it. 
        (giggles to herself)
      That is if he even could. 

She looks at Darleen and Amberr sheepishly.  All three of 
them break into desperately needed laughter.

             AMBERR
      Im sorry I was such a bitch to you 
      Vivian.

             VIVIAN
      Its ok. 

Vivian really starts to crack, the laughter spilling out.

             AMBERR
      What?

             VIVIAN
      You know, I came here because I 
      want to be the next Diane Sawyer?


Amberr and Darleen sit in a moment of silence.
And then, again, all three careen into a seemingly endless 
stream of giggles.

             VIVIAN 
      I swear.  I did!  I wanna be 
      everything she is.  In my eyes, 
      shes the most perfect person that 
      ever was.

             AMBERR
      She does have great hair.

             VIVIAN
      The best hair.  Its so good.

             AMBERR
      You know, even though my life feels 
      like a big Texas sized tornado 
      right now, Im really having fun 
      with you guys. 

The devil shines in Amberrs eyes.

             AMBERR 
      But somethin tells me we could 
      have even more fun.

Amberr pulls an American Express card from her purse.

             AMBERR 
      Asshole is so caught up with his 
      new chickadoo he forgot to take me 
      off his credit cards.

             VIVIAN
      I dont know if...

             DARLEEN
        (cuts her off)
      Let her do it.  LET THE GIRL DO IT!

SMASH TO:

A SERIES OF QUICK CUTS IN THE HOTEL ROOM:

-- ROOM SERVICE arrives with A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE, Amberr 
signs for it.

-- Thirty minutes later Room Service arrives with A BOTTLE OF 
TEQUILA, Amberr signs for it.

-- Vivian, Amberr and Darleen DOING SHOTS OF TEQUILA.  

-- Amberr stumbles over to her purse and MAKES A CALL ON HER 
PHONE.

I/E. DOOR - MOMENTS LATER 

Davine is at the door.  He hands a SMALL VILE to Amberr with 
a wink.

             DAVINE
      You have fun with that girl. 

Amberr opens the tiny vile and sees THREE TABS OF ECSTACY. 
She smiles and puts the vile in her bra.

             AMBERR
      Youre the best, Davine. 

BACK IN THE ROOM:

Vivian and Darleen are both on the floor, cracking up as they 
take yet ANOTHER SHOT OF TEQUILA.

             AMBERR 
      Alight girls, I say we get 
      ourselves all prettied up and go 
      out there and paint that town red, 
      whattaya say?

Amberr reaches over and grabs her ENORMOUS make up bag from 
her purse and smiles.

SMASH TO:

INT. BATHROOM - A WHILE LATER

The harsh, cheap, fluorescent lighting of the hotel bathroom 
only further enhances the garish, awful, tranny-like make up 
on all three of them as they stare, blankly, at their 
reflections in the mirror.

             DARLEEN
      Wow. I dont really know what to 
      say.

Vivian lightly caresses the thick layer of paint like blush 
upon her cheek.

             VIVIAN
      Yeah. Wow.

             DARLEEN
      I mean, I look...
        (takes a moment, smiles 
         proudly)
      HOT!  

Darleen swirls her hips like a stripper.

             DARLEEN 
      Like hold the hot sauce cause Im 
      ALREADY TOO SPICY HOT!  

Amberr smiles, so proud of her work.

             VIVIAN
      At first I thought the make up was 
      a tinch heavy but the more I stare 
      at myself the more beautiful I 
      feel.  
        (sincere, drunk)
      Thanks for making me have so much 
      beautifulness Amberr.

             AMBERR
      My pleasure.
        (smiles devilishly)
      You guys up for a little...
        (winks)
      ...extra kick before we go out?

Vivian and Darleen are totally oblivious to what Amberr is 
talking about.  

             VIVIAN
        (smiles)
      Sounds great!

As Vivian and Darleen admire their grotesquely over made up 
images in the mirror, Amberr pours three shots of Tequila.  
She pulls the TINY VILE FROM HER BRA and drops a tab in each 
one of their shot glasses.  

Amberr hands Darleen and Vivian their shots.

CUT TO:

             AMBERR
      Bottoms up!

Darleen and Amberr toss theirs in a flash. Vivian hands hers 
off to Darleen.

             VIVIAN
      I lied. Im too drunk.  I cant do 
      it.

Darleen grabs it from her.

             DARLEEN
      Well, thats what friends are for.

             AMBERR
      I dont know if you want to do 
      that.

             DARLEEN
      Im from Montana, sweetie.  This is 
      how we roll.

And with that, she throws it back.

             AMBERR
      Well then. Lets show this town 
      what were made of!

EXT. VEGAS STRIP - MOMENTS LATER

Amberr, Vivian and Darleen bust trough the hotel door and out 
onto the Vegas strip. 

The chaotic world around them swirls into a vacuum of slow 
motion the minute they enter it. Stares of confusion and 
muted laughter, from most everyone they pass, go completely 
unnoticed by the three of them.  

Their confident swagger unbreakable.

EXT. CLUB MOONBLUE - MINUTES LATER

The line to get into this white-hot-for-the-moment Vegas 
nightspot is HUNDREDS OF HIPSTERS DEEP.  Amberr, Darleen and 
Vivian look ANCIENT and COMPLETELY out of place.  Everyone 
else is in up-to-the-minute club wear.

             VIVIAN
      I dont know guys.  Thats a really 
      long line.  Do you think its worth 
      it?

             AMBERR
      Of course it is!
        (winks)
      Ill be right back.


Amberr toodles off toward the BOUNCER.
SMASH TO:

SECONDS LATER:

Amberr, Darleen and Vivian are whisked past the red velvet 
rope.

             AMBERR
        (to Darleen and Vivian)
      Amazing what a lil Texas charm 
      will do!

INT. CLUB MOONBLUE - CONTINUOUS

Amberr, Darleen and Vivian stare in awe. The blue hued club 
is dripping from top to bottom with sexy clubsters.

Its powerful and intense. The strong, downtempo club-beats 
have the entire room bouncing in almost perfect unison.

A group of HOT TWENTY SOMETHING GUYS walk by.

             HOT GUY
      DUDES, CHECK IT!
        (laughing, re: Amberr)
      THATS THE CHICK THAT SHOWED HER 
      PUSSY TO THE BOUNCER AT THE DOOR!

They all wince and laugh as they walk past.  Horrified, 
Vivian turns to Amberr and Darleen. They are both in a trance 
like state of blissful oblivion as they stare out to the 
enormous, loud, pumping, dance floor.

             VIVIAN
        (shouting over the loud 
         music)
      DARLEEN, ARE YOU OK?

             DARLEEN
      IM GONNA BE REAL HONEST WITH YOU 
      GUYS.  RIGHT NOW?  MY BRAIN FEELS 
      LIKE ITS HAVING SEX WITH ITSELF.

Amberr smiles with intoxicated euphoria.

             AMBERR
      ISNT BEING ON E THE BEST?

             VIVIAN
        (jaw agape)
      E, LIKE THE ILLEGAL DRUG?

Amberr smiles devilishly.

             VIVIAN 
      OH MY GOD! DARLEEN, YOURE ON 
      DRUGS!  HOW DO YOU FEEL?!

Darleen takes a moment.

             DARLEEN
      SO FAR, ITS A FUCKING FIRST RATE 
      EXPERIENCE.

THE DANCE FLOOR:

Amberr and Darleen are in wonderland.

Theyve joined in the unified SEA OF SEXY CLUB GOERS.  Their 
hands in the air.  Hitting the beats.  Their eyes swirling 
with the lights. 

The music and their souls pulsing as one. 

Vivian dances along side them but shes out of step with the 
collective energy of the moment. Her dance moves feel more 
teenage cousins banquet hall wedding than hot Vegas 
club.  

But shes drunk and loving it and thats what matters.

             VIVIAN
        (shouts to Amberr and 
         Darleen)
      I BET PATTY LANE WOULD HAVE A HEART 
      ATTACK IF SHE KNEW WHAT WE WERE UP 
      TO RIGHT NOW!

             AMBERR
      FUCK PATTY LANE IS WHAT I SAY! 

Vivian gasps, deals with it and then cracks up.

             VIVIAN
      HONESTLY GUYS? THIS IS THE BEST 
      NIGHT EVER! 

Amberr smiles and grabs Vivian and Darleens hands pulling 
them off the dance floor.


             VIVIAN       WHERE ARE WE GOING?

SMASH CUT TO:

EXT. OLD WAREHOUSE WAY (WAY) OFF THE STRIP - HALF HOUR LATER

Amberr, Vivian and Darleen look ahead to the old, dilapidated 
warehouse in front of them.  

A small door with swirling lights emanating from it and a 
SCARY LOOKING, HEAVILY INKED BOUNCER the only signs of life.

             VIVIAN
        (re: scary looking club 
         and bouncer)
      Are you sure we should go in there?

             AMBERR
      Davine said this place was divine.

INT. CLUB X - MINUTES LATER

Amberr, Vivian and Darleen walk through this tripped out, 
packed to the walls club.  ITS DECORATED LIKE A FOREST BUT 
EVERYTHINGS MADE WITH CARPET.  

CLUB GOERS, MANY IN TRIPPY COSTUMES and all of whom appear to 
be on E, rub their bodies against the carpeted walls, trees 
and each other.

             VIVIAN
        (horrified)
      Guys, I think we might be at a 
      naked sex party or something.

No response.

             VIVIAN 
      Guys?

Vivian turns around and sees AMBERR AND DARLEEN admiring the 
TRAY of GLOW STICKS and CANDY that a GIRL DRESSED LIKE  
SLUTTY WONDER WOMAN is carrying around.  

Amberr grabs a GLOW WAND and swirls it around, mesmerized by 
the neon color and toodles off into the crowd.

Darleen grabs a PACK OF POP ROCKS CANDY.


             DARLEEN
        (so happy)
      I havent had these since I was a 
      kid!

She rips open the package and pours them in her mouth.  The 
MINUTE THE FIRST ROCK POPS, SHE SPIRALS INTO HYSTERIA and 
tries to spit them out, CREATING A SMALL RIVER OF MULTI-COLOR 
DROOL.

             DARLEEN 
        (PANIC STRICKEN)
      ITS LIKE VIETNAM IN MY MOUTH!

Even though she feels badly, Vivian cant help but laugh.

MOMENTS LATER:

Vivian and Darleen rest up against a carpet tree, exhausted.  
Vivian sips on her drink and Darleens hands rub up and down 
the carpeted tree trunk, orgasmically engaging with the 
fibers.

             DARLEEN
        (almost angry)
      Man, being on drugs is lot to deal 
      with.  

             VIVIAN
      Oh my god, look!

Vivian points across the room.  AMBERR IS LAID OUT AND MAKING 
OUT WITH A GUY IN A NEON BUNNY COSTUME.

             DARLEEN
      In a weird way, it kinda makes me 
      miss Hank.

             VIVIAN
        (thinks, smiles)
      You know what?  Ill be right back.

             DARLEEN
      Where are you going?  Because I 
      dont want to leave this tree.  I 
      really love this tree.  

Darleen rubs her arms up and down the trunk.

             DARLEEN 
      I love it so GOD DAMN MUCH!

             VIVIAN
        (laughs)
      Stay put.  Ill be right back.

EXT. IN FRONT OF CLUB X - MOMENTS LATER

Still sipping on her yard of margarita, Vivian pulls her 
phone from her purse. Without any hesitation, she dials.

INTERCUT WITH:

Ryan, asleep in his dark bedroom wakes from his ringing 
phone.  He looks at the clock, its 4:00 AM.  He instantly 
picks up.

             RYAN
        (groggy, confused)
      Hello?

             VIVIAN
        (drunk, cheerful, nervous)
      Ryan!  Hey, its me Vivian! What 
      are you up to?

             RYAN         
      Well, its four am. I was sleeping.

             VIVIAN
        (so embarrassed)
      Right.  That makes sense!  I 
      probably should be too.

             RYANS VOICE
      Everything ok?

             VIVIAN
      Yeah.  
        (then, nervous)
      I just wanted to say thank you 
      again for making this happen for 
      me.  I dont have a lot of 
      experience with that.  You know, 
      with people doing things for me.  
      It was really nice of you.

             RYAN    
      I think what youre doing is great, 
      Vivi.  Glad I could help.

             VIVIAN
      Well, I should probably get back 
      into the club and check on Darleen.


             RYANS VOICE
        (laughs)
      The club?

             VIVIAN
      If only you could see where I was. 
        (laughs)
      Its been one heck of a time so 
      far.  

             RYAN
      Well, enjoy yourself.  
        (then)
      And be safe.  Good night Vivi.

             VIVIAN
      Good night.

INT. A COVE IN THE CLUB FOREST - FIVE A.M.

Darleen, now with glow stickers on her face and silly putty 
in her hands rests on a carpet tree stump as she comes down 
from her E high.  

Amberr, also coming off her high, sits nestled in the Neon 
Yellow Bunnys lap, who is playing with her hair.

Vivian, deep in thought, cracks herself up.

             VIVIAN
      You know what?

             DARLEEN
      Huh.

             VIVIAN
      Im glad I met you Amberr.  You 
      have helped me realize that Im not 
      the only one here whose life is 
      screwed up.

Amberr and Vivian laugh at their weird realities.

             AMBERR
      I learned a lot of things tonight 
      but number one is, I am going to do 
      more drugs.  I love being on drugs 
      so much.  

             VIVIAN
      I bet were not the only ones.

             AMBERR
      That love drugs?

             VIVIAN
        (laughs)
      No! I bet were not the only ones 
      that are this screwed up.  I mean 
      think about it?  What kind of 
      happy, loved woman who has a great 
      life would enter a beauty pageant 
      when she was married?  
        (laughs at the thought)
      She wouldnt need the validation.  
      The only women here are women who 
      need to have other people tell them 
      they are beautiful. Other people 
      tell them that theyre great or 
      smart or talented or whatever.  
        (yawns)
      Thats why were all here.

Vivians eyes begin to fade.  The last thing she sees is 
Darleen making an imprint of her nose with silly putty.

THE NEXT MORNING:

             MANS VOICE
      Time to go.  Partys over.

Vivian peels her eyes open and looks around, dazed.  
Hungover.  Confused.   She looks up to see the SCARY BOUNCER.

             SCARY BOUNCER
      8 am.  Partys over.

Vivian panics as it all comes flooding back.

             VIVIAN
      Oh my god!  

She runs over to Darleen and shakes her awake.  Darleen has 
her and Vivians purses tied around her ankle.

             VIVIAN 
      DARLEEN! Wake up! 

Darleens eyes slowly open.  Vivian unties the purses.

             VIVIAN 
      WAKE UP!  We gotta go!  The 
      pageant, oh my god! What did I do!?

Vivian looks around as Darleen slowly comes to.


             VIVIAN       Oh no. Wheres Amberr?

Darleen looks at her arm which has VENETIAN RM. 808 written 
on it in marker.

             DARLEEN
        (confused slur)
      I dont know.

SMASH TO:

I/E. DOOR TO BIG FANCY SUITE, #808, AT THE VENETIAN - MINUTES 
LATER

Amberr, in a tiny white babydoll answers the door with a 
bright and cheery smile.

             AMBERR
        (like everything is 
         completely normal)
      Good mornin sleepy heads!  I was 
      wonderin when yall were gonna get 
      here!

A MAN (40s, Indian, slight in build) pops out from under the 
covers, startling Vivian and Darleen.

             AMBERR 
      I got a second wind last night 
      after you two went nighty nite.  
        (so excited)
      Davine got me some more drugs.  I 
      just took a lil tabbie.  Yall want 
      some?

             DARLEEN
      Meh, I think Im good.
        (almost sad)
      Forever.

             VIVIAN
        (whispers, re: Indian man 
         in the bed)
      Whos that?

             AMBERR
      Pardeep.  
        (big smile)
      We got married last night!

Darleen and Vivian see the HEAD OF THE NEON BUNNY COSTUME on 
the floor by the bed.


             VIVIAN      Oh.
      Ok.

(then)


SMASH CUT TO:

INT. CIRCUS CIRCUS HOTEL - LOBBY - A WHILE LATER

Vivian, Darleen and Amberr do a group-walk-of-wasted-shame 
through the hotels revolving front doors.

They walk through the casino which is already buzzing with 
the beeping, clinking sounds of slot machines.  Theyre still 
sporting their slutty make up and look very worse for wear.

             VIVIAN
        (sudden panic)
      Oh, no.

             AMBERR
      What?

All of them turn their heads to where Vivian is looking and 
see PATTY LANE GALLOPING THEIR WAY.

             PATTY LANE
      Looks like you girls are...
        (confused)
      ...up ready for the day?

             AMBERR
      Actually were just--

             DARLEEN
        (cuts Amberr off)
      Yes, they are up and ready for the 
      big day!   I took it upon myself to 
      get them up early for a work out.

Patty thinks about this for a moment and clearly abandons 
reason.

             PATTY LANE
      Now, thats what I call commitment!  
      If I had gold stars to give out, I 
      would give them to the two of you!

             AMBERR
      I love gold stars.

Amberr hugs Patty aggressively.  Patty is wearing a CASHMERE 
SWEATER.  It feels really good on Amberrs hands.  


Amberr continues the hug, well past normal time limits, her HANDS RUNNING UP AND DOWN PATTYS BACK.  Patty, awkwardly, 
peels Amberr off and steps away.

             PATTY LANE
        (confused, smiles)
      Amberr, are you feeling alright?

             AMBERR
      I feel fantastic!

             PATTY LANE
      Well, that was a very long hug.
        (to Vivian)
      I noticed your husband still hasnt 
      signed in at the husband check in 
      table.  Hes the only one not here.  
      He is coming isnt he?

             VIVIAN
      Just spoke to him not a minute ago.  
      Hes on his way!

             PATTY LANE
      Oh, well thats good news.  It 
      would be so terribly awkward if he 
      wasnt here. In fact, aside from 
      one contestant whose husband was 
      called to duty overseas at the last 
      minute...
        (does the sign of the 
         cross)
      ...may he rest in peace.
        (then)
      It would be a pageant first.

             VIVIAN
      Well, hes coming and looking 
      forward to it!  Said he could 
      hardly sleep last night he was so 
      excited.

             PATTY LANE
      Guess what they say is true!  
      Behind every great woman is an even 
      greater man.

             AMBERR
        (under her breath)
      Thats a bunch a bullshit.

             PATTY LANE
      What was that Amberr?


             DARLEEN
      Shes got that cough thats going 
      around. Better get her upstairs to 
      rest!

             PATTY LANE
      Sounds like a plan!  See you ladies 
      later!

Patty walks away.

             AMBERR
        (to Vivian)
      You havent heard from him, have 
      you?

             VIVIAN
      Nope.  

             AMBERR
      Are you sad?

             VIVIAN
      Disappointment is my normal. 

FADE THROUGH:

INT. BACK STAGE OF PAGEANT - MOMENTS LATER

The only contestant there, Amberr, high and wasted stares at 
her mangled reflection in the mirror.

Her assistant Davine walks in with his crates full of hair 
falls and glittery make up.

             DAVINE
        (startled, re: her hair 
         and make up)
      Oh honey child.  You need help.

             AMBERR
      Yes I do Davine.  
        (a beat)
      Yes I do...

EXT. POOL AREA  - CONTINUOUS 

Darleen, on her phone, paces back and forth crying.

             HANK 
      Hello?


             DARLEEN
      I did drugs Hank.  I did illegal 
      drugs and I didnt even hate it as 
      much as I should have.

INT. HALLWAY - SAME TIME

Vivian struggles with her room key.  Just as shes about to 
give up, the door opens.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Vivian walks into the room.

             VIVIAN
      OH MY GOD!

REVEAL: Leonard laying on the bed, drinking a beer and 
watching ESPN on the flat screen.

             VIVIAN 
      Oh thank god! Youre here!
        (shell shocked)
      I cant believe you actually came.

Leonards eyes stay glued to the TV.  Vivian sits down next 
to him on the bed.

             VIVIAN 
      I know you dont like it when I get 
      all emotional so Im just gonna say 
      this real plain and simple.  It 
      means more to me than youll ever, 
      ever know that you came here today.  
      I know what I big deal it is.  This 
      is the first time youve ever left 
      Montana. 

             LEONARD
      Ive been to Wyoming.

             VIVIAN
      Right, I forgot. 

Somehow, deep in the dysfunction of their relationship, they 
share a moment of awkward care between each other.

A very brief moment.

             LEONARD
      Where were you?  You look kinda 
      slutty.


             VIVIAN        (thinking on her feet)
      Uh... rehearsing and stuff.  Its 
      been real busy here.  Did you bring 
      a suit like I told you?

Leonard nods.

             VIVIAN 
      Ok, well we better get you ready.


CUT TO:

Vivian, showered and refreshed, tugs at the suit jacket 
Leonard is wearing.  No matter what direction she pulls, its 
way too small and he looks ridiculous.

             VIVIAN 
      I told you the black suit from your 
      grannie's funeral.  
        (catches herself)
      But you look very handsome in this 
      one.

             LEONARD
      Thanks. Im sure once you get your 
      fancy dress on and stuff youre 
      gonna look real pretty too.

             VIVIAN
      Thanks Leonard.
        (smiles)
      Ok, so all you gotta do is walk me 
      across the stage and then theyll 
      ask you a question and you answer 
      it.  Thats all and youre done!

             LEONARD
      What are they gonna ask me?  

             VIVIAN
      I dont know.  Thats part of it.  
      That youre supposed to answer on 
      the spot, to see what you really 
      think.

             LEONARD
      Well, what if I dont know what to 
      say?

             VIVIAN
      Youll just have to think of 
      something. 


             VIVIAN       Youve known me since I was 
      thirteen.  Shouldnt be all that 
      hard, right?

Vivian grabs her dress and her duffle bag full of make up and 
hair stuff.

             VIVIAN 
      Not to mention, youre only gonna 
      have to go up there if I make it 
      into the top five.  

             LEONARD
      Right.
        (thinks)
      Just in case they ask, whats your 
      favorite color.

             VIVIAN
      Uh, green I guess.

             LEONARD
      Right, like your eyes.

             VIVIAN
	     Yeah.
        (shocked)
      Like my eyes.

Vivian heads for the door.

             VIVIAN 
      You should be in your seat fifteen 
      minutes before it starts.  Someone 
      will come get you when its time to 
      come backstage with me.  Everything 
      will be really easy.  I promise.

Vivian looks Leonard in the eyes, connecting, at some level, 
with him for the first time in a long time and then heads 
out.

             LEONARD
      Vivian?

Vivian stops in her tracks.

             VIVIAN
      Yeah?

             LEONARD
      Good luck or break a leg or 
      whatever it is Im supposed to say.  


             VIVIAN      Thanks. 


INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

Vivian is alone.  Nervous but determined.  

En route, in her mind, to the last-stop-on-the-life-changing 
train.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Darleen swipes her key and walks in.

             DARLEEN
      Well, Hank took that a lot better 
      than I thought he would.

She looks up and sees Leonard, hes already cracked a mini JD 
from the mini bar.

             DARLEEN 
   Leonard!  

             LEONARD
      Darleen.

             DARLEEN
      I came up here looking for Vivian.  
      I guess she already went down.

             LEONARD
      Yep.

             DARLEEN
      Im real proud of you that you 
      came.  

Leonard is silent.  He takes a swig from his mini-bottle.

             DARLEEN 
      Hittin the mini-bar already are ya?

             LEONARD
        (softens)
      I get nervous in front of people.  
      If she gets in the top five I gotta 
      talk about her to the whole place.

             DARLEEN
      I get that.  
        (then)
      I get that.  Just take it easy, ok?

Darleen grabs her things and heads out.

INT. BACKSTAGE - MOMENTS LATER

Vivian sits at her spot at a vanity mirror, her modest 
collection of cosmetics laid out in front of her.

Darleen toodles in.

             VIVIAN
      I cant believe he actually came.

             DARLEEN
      I think Id have been less 
      surprised if I opened my shower 
      door this morning and saw Garth 
      Brooks standing in there naked and 
      waitin for me.

Darleen hands her the dress bag.

             VIVIAN
      Whats this?

Darleen shrugs.  Vivian unzips the garment bag, revealing, 
inch by inch, the STUNNING PURPLE GOWN INSIDE.

             VIVIAN 
      Oh my god! Darleen.
        (beat)
      I cant accept this!  Its the most 
      beautiful thing Ive ever seen,  
      but I just cant.

             DARLEEN
      Well, you better.  Cause Ill spend 
      more on god damn Jenny Craig trying 
      to fit into the thing than I did on 
      the dress itself.  Not to mention 
      Id rather drink rat poison than 
      give the little twat-head that sold 
      it to me the satisfaction of me 
      returning it.

             VIVIAN
      Thank you so much.
        (eyes filled with tears)

             VIVIAN 
      It looks just like a box of Raisin 
      Bran.

             DARLEEN
      Thats why I knew it had to be 
      yours. You are literally the only 
      person that would ever wear it.

             VIVIAN
        (laughs)
      Its perfect.

             DARLEEN
      All I ask in return is that you 
      just go out there and do me proud, 
      like I know you can.
        (big smiles)
      Now lets get this hair and make up 
      done!

CUT TO:

INT. BACKSTAGE - FIFTEEN MINUTES BEFORE PAGEANT TIME

Vivian, in the pageant issued red, white and blue one piece 
bathing suit, high heels and a glittery MRS. MONTANA sash 
paces backstage.  

Her hair is big and sprayed.  

Her make up heavy and shimmery.

INT. AUDITORIUM - SAME TIME

Darleen makes her way through the auditorium.

FAMILIES AND FRIENDS flood in, most carrying SIGNS WITH 
CONTESTANTS PHOTOS, MESSAGES OF SUPPORT.  Large groups of 
people for each woman.

Darleen looks at LEONARDS SEAT.

Its empty.

INT. STAGE - MOMENTS LATER

LOUD MUSIC begins, the CURTAINS LIFT, LIGHTS SWIRLING.

A LIT UP MRS. MARRIED AMERICA SIGN graces the entire back 
of the stage.


The CONTESTANTS, IN MATCHING RED WHITE AND BLUE ONE PIECE BATHING SUITS FLOOD ONTO THE STAGE. 

Theyre singing and dancing with ridiculous amounts of 
charisma.

             CONTESTANTS
        (singing)
      Im so proud to be an American! 
      So proud to be red, white and blue. 
      Im so proud to be married! 
      Because I know that love is true.  
      I make casseroles and change 
      diapers! 
      I lead a crazy busy life! 
      But Im proud most of all to say, 
      IM A WIFE!

When they finish their number the HOST, male, 50s, 
alarmingly tan and plastic, takes the stage.

             HOST
      Well, that was something wasnt it!  
      Good evening and welcome to the 
      fifty fourth annual Mrs. Married 
      America Pageant!  The pageant that

FADE THROUGH:

introduction, we get to:

             MRS. MISSISSIPPI
      From the home of the Mud Pie I am 
      Deelynn Frank and I am Mrs. 
      Mississippi!

MRS. MISSOURI, looks WAY too young to be married.

             MRS. MISSOURI
      As a cardinals fan, I plan to knock 
      this one out of the park.  I am 
      Heather Stevens and I am Mrs. 
      Missouri!

Vivian takes center stage.  Confident.  Poised.

             VIVIAN
      From the Big Sky state, I am Vivian 
      Huntsman, Mrs. Montana!

INT. LOBBY OF AUDITORIUM - SAME TIME

Darleen, on her phone, paces back and forth as she waits for 
Leonard to answer.

             LEONARD 
      Hi, youve reached Leonard, leave a 
      message and Ill maybe call you 
      back.

             DARLEEN
      Leonard, its Darleen.  I know we 
      dont see eye to eye on a single 
      damn thing and this is the last 
      time Ill ever ask anything of you.  
      But you gotta get your ass here. 
      She needs you.

INT. ON THE STAGE - CONTINUOUS

The CONTESTS are all POSED on the stage. Huge hair. Bigger 
smiles.

             HOST
      Alright, ladies and gentleman! 
      Youve just met fifty of the most 
      beautiful married women in America!  
      Now for the brutal part.  We need 
      to make out first cut of the 
      evening. I know it comes sooner 
      than wed all like but weve 
      compiled our first round of scores 
      from a combination of application 
      essays, photographs, and 
      congeniality among contestants.

Patty Lane, in a grotesquely sequined evening gown, delivers 
AN ENVELOPE to the Host. 

             HOST 
      Thank you Patty! 
        (opens the envelope)
      When I call your name, please come 
      to the front of the stage. The 
      first of our top ten finalists 
      is... 


As he calls their name, the contestants make their way to their marks at the front of the stage.

             HOST 
      Mrs. Ohio, welcome to the top ten! 
      Next up, well see more of Mrs. 
      Oklahoma sooner than later!  
      Followed by a big ray of sunshine 
      from Mrs. California!  Well, they 
      say everythings big in this state, 
      lets see if well get a big win 
      from Mrs. Texas!

Amberr, lit up like a Christmas tree on crack makes her way 
to her spot.

             HOST 
      Eight US presidents were born here, 
      lets see if we can add Mrs. 
      Married America to that list of 
      dignitaries, congratulations Mrs. 
      Virginia!  Aloha to Mrs. Hawaii!  
      Well, why dont you gallop on down 
      here like a horse in the derby Mrs. 
      Kentucky!  Looks like well get to 
      see more of those peaches from Mrs. 
      Georgia!  Alright ladies and 
      gentleman, our second to last 
      finalist is Mrs. Montana!

Vivian gasps when her name is called and makes her way to her 
spot at the front of the stage.

             HOST 
      And last but not least Mrs. 
      Florida! Audience, please give a 
      big round of applause for our top 
      ten finalists in the running to be 
      Mrs. Married America two thousand 
      and twelve!   Up next, well see 
      these lovely ladies perform their 
      talents for our esteemed panel of 
      celebrity judges!

THE JUDGES TABLE:

A MOTLEY MIX OF C LIST OR LOWER CELEBRITIES, maybe some super 
old ice skaters, an ex playboy model and at least one vintage 
TV star.


INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS
Vivian scans her SHEET MUSIC as Darleen powders Vivians 
face.

             VIVIAN
      Im so damn nervous. What if I go 
      out there and forget how to play 
      the piano or something?

             DARLEEN
      That would be really embarrassing.
        (then)
      And weird.  And funny.

Vivian rolls her eyes and laughs at Darleen.  

INT. STAGE - TALENT COMPETITION

THROUGH A SERIES OF QUICK CUTS WE SEE:

--  AMBERR in a FLAME INSPIRED UNITARD, JUGGLING BALLS OF 
FLAME.  She loses MORE THAN ONE OF HER BALLS and STAGE HANDS 
have to put them out with fire extinguishers.

--  MRS. OHIO doing an assultingly MACABRE MODERN DANCE 
DRESSED AS A FLAMINGO.  

-- VIVIAN at the piano, she plays the theme song from LITTLE 
HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE.  A simple song but she plays it 
beautifully and totally nails it. (Albeit, with the dramatic 
enthusiasm that one might express playing something more 
along the lines of R. Strauss: Burleske).  

Vivian rises from her concerto performance and takes a lady 
like bow to her audience as they applaud mightily.

INT. STAGE - SAME TIME

The Host makes his way back on the stage, the ten finalists 
behind him.  Nervous.  Holding hands.  Anxious.

             HOST
      Wow, I dont know about you but 
      that flame thrower had me on the 
      edge of my seat!  If I could 
      welcome back the ten finalists, I 
      have a little envelope here and in 
      it are the names of five of the 
      luckiest married women in the 
      world.  With no further ado... 
      first up, Mrs. Texas!


Amberr, looking just-to-the-left of normal, smiles and makes her way to the front of the stage but not without TRIPPING ON 
THE TRAIN OF HER DRESS on the way.

             AMBERR
      Im ok!

             HOST
      Good to hear.
        (reads the card)
      Our next finalist is Mrs. Ohio!

Already in tears, Mrs. Ohio makes her way to the front of the 
stage.

             HOST 
      Mrs. California!

Mrs. California confidently swaggers her way to the front of 
the stage.

             HOST 
      Mrs. Hawaii!

Mrs. Hawaii graciously waves as she takes her place.

             HOST 
      And last but certainly not least we 
      have a history making finalist.  
      For the first time ever, her state 
      will be represented in the top 
      five,  Mrs. Montana!

Stunned and stunning in her Versace gown, Vivian makes her 
way to the front of the stage. 

             HOST 
      Well, congratulations ladies! 
        (to the losers)
      And to you for making it to the top 
      ten.  You may officially leave the 
      stage now.

The Host makes his way over to Amberr.

             HOST 
      Hi Amberr.  How are you feeling, 
      nervous?

             AMBERR
        (tipsy, slurry mess)
      No, in fact Ive never felt so 
      strongly that I was standing in the 
      right place at the right time in my 
      whole life!  Im so happy for 
      myself!    

The audience applauds.  The Host looks at Amberr 
suspiciously, her wasted-ness not going unnoticed.

             HOST
      We are happy for you too!
        (moving on)
      So! We will now begin the question 
      and answer portion of the evening.
        (re: fishbowl on a table)
      I will randomly draw judge created 
      questions from this bowl and ask 
      each of you for your thoughts on 
      things ranging from the political 
      to the personal.  Amberr, youre up 
      first!

The Host SWIRLS HIS HAND AROUND IN THE FISHBOWL and pulls out 
a card.

             HOST 
        (reads)
      How would you define the perfect 
      husband?

Amberr smiles.

             AMBERR
      Thats easy!  A man who has 
      character, who is loving, caring, 
      present and a provider.  Someone 
      that you want to walk through life 
      with everyday and in the eternities 
      beyond. Oh, and he has to be able 
      to tell a good joke too.

             HOST
      Wow, well that sounds like a great 
      man.

             AMBERR
      May I say one more thing?

             HOST
      You still have thirty seconds on 
      the clock!

             AMBERR
      Essentially a man that is the exact 
      opposite of my piece of shit poor 
      excuse for a human ex husband. 
      Thats right I said ex.  Im a 
      fuckin divorcee. I may be a little 
      drunk still and I may or may not 
      have taken some Ecstasy last night 
      but that doesnt change the fact 
      that my ex husband has a small 
      penis and got caught looking at gay 
      porn once when we were in college. 
      Honestly, Id love to stab him in 
      the asshole for treating me the way 
      he has but I wont because he has 
      chronic diarrhea. You can have him 
      Susie-what-ever-the-hell-your-name-
      is.

INT. AUDIENCE - SAME TIME

A spotlight on him, AMBERRS EX-HUSBAND GETS UP AND STORMS 
OUT OF THE AUDITORIUM.

INT. BACKSTAGE - SAME TIME

Everyone backstage (various contestants, stylists etc) come 
to a COMPLETE STAND STILL, TOTALLY SHOCKED by what Amberr has 
said.

Darleen STARTS A SLOW CLAP.

             DARLEEN
        (to anyone that will 
         listen, re: her slow clap 
         for Amberr)
      Am I right?

No one else joins her.

INT. STAGE - CONTINUOUS

Vivian smiles proudly.  She cant believe her ears, but she 
smiles.

             HOST
      Wow, so much to address!  First and 
      foremost, if youre no longer 
      married youll unfortunately be 
      immediately disqualified.

             AMBERR
      I said I was divorced.  
        (smiles)
      I didnt say I wasnt married.

A collective gasp is heard from the audience.  

             AMBERR 
      I have a new husband.  I LOVE YOU 
      PARDEEP! I WANT TO HAVE YOUR ARAB 
      BABIES!

Pardeep, who is not Arab, stands up in the audience proudly.

Amberr, on her way back to her spot, trips over the train on 
her dress again.  Fed up she RIPS THE TRAIN OFF and tosses it 
to the back of the stage.

             HOST
        (to the audience)
      Mrs. Texas everybody!

The crowd applauds with confusion.

             HOST 
      Up next, Mrs. Hawaii!

We fade through the next few contestants as they nervously 
answer their questions.

Mrs. Ohio, is at the tail end of her answer.

             MRS. OHIO
      In closing, like the seven layers 
      of a delicious seven layer dip, 
      those are the seven key elements to 
      an exciting intimate life with your 
      husband without sacrificing your 
      Christian ideals!

The crowd roars with applause.

             HOST
      Well, ladies and gentlemen, this 
      has been one interesting question 
      and answer round. Our final 
      contestant is up next, Mrs. 
      Montana!

The Host steps beside Vivian.

             HOST 
      Vivian, has it settled in yet that 
      youre making history being the 
      first contestant from Montana to 
      make it to the top five?

             VIVIAN
        (smiles)
      It hasnt settled in yet that Im 
      even here.  This is like a dream to 
      me.

The crowd laughs and applauds.  

             HOST
      Alright, for your question.

EVERYTHING MOVES TO SLOW MO AS HE SWIRLS HIS HAND AROUND THE 
FISHBOWL.  

He pulls out a card and reads it to himself.

             HOST 
      This is an interesting one.

Small beads of sweat accumulate on Vivians browline as the 
magnitude of this moment settles in.

Flashes of reality.

The lights.

The audience.

The other contestants.

             HOST 
      Do you believe that clearly 
      defined, stereotypical male female 
      roles can help or hurt a marriage?  
      And why?

Vivians mind is racing.  Say what she thinks?  

Say what she should?

The host smiles out to the audience as Vivian takes a moment.

             VIVIAN
      Well...

Its only a handful of seconds but to everyone watching it 
seems like forever.


             VIVIAN 
        (swallows)
      ...like most things in life Id say 
      moderation is the key to happiness.  
      Finding a balance. 

Vivian looks out to the eager audience and smiles nervously.

             VIVIAN 
      But that doesnt mean I do.  Its 
      hard to find that balance. For 
      example, I, personally, hate to 
      cook.  In fact, I loathe it.

A few gasps pop up throughout the audience.

             VIVIAN 
      Yep.  I do. Cant stand it.  
      Cleaning and laundry?  I dread 
      knowing those things are on my 
      daily to do list. But I do those 
      things everyday because I have 
      children that I love so much that I 
      would die for them.  So even if it 
      means making a tuna casserole when 
      Id rather be travelling the world 
      as a journalist, I do it.  Because 
      Im a Mom and thats what being a 
      Mom in my household means.  Whether 
      it was what I signed up for or not.  
      It is what it is and Im good at 
      it.  I just hope that someday I can 
      make a tuna casserole after also 
      being able to do something Im 
      passionate about.  Which quite 
      frankly, is a lot more than just 
      being a wife.

Raucous applause flows through the auditorium.

             HOST
      Well, clearly youve struck a chord 
      with our audience.  Thank you 
      Vivian!

INT. BACKSTAGE - MOMENTS LATER           

As Darleen polishes Vivians curls, Vivian looks in the 
mirror, blank.

Withdrawn.

             VIVIAN
      Youre sure hes not out there?  
      Maybe hes in the wrong seat.  

Beat.

             DARLEEN
      Hes not out there, Viv.

INT. STAGE - SAME TIME

             HOST
      Up next, the finalists walk the 
      stage for in the traditional 
      husband wife parade!  This is a 
      tradition that has been a part of 
      Mrs. Married America since our 
      first pageant in 1957.  The 
      husbands of these lovely women will 
      escort them across the stage and 
      then answer a question about their 
      beautiful bride. Before we do, 
      lets give a warm welcome to last 
      years winner,  the current 
      reigning Mrs. Married America Lisa 
      Daniels from Des Moines Iowa!

Mrs. Married America 2011 walks onto the stage.

INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

Patty approaches Vivian, flustered and demanding.

             PATTY LANE
      Vivian, your husband should be back 
      here by now. Hes the only one not 
      here.
        (cutting)
      Id hate to think we wasted our 
      selection for Mrs. Montana.

             VIVIAN
      Well, Im sure you didnt have any 
      other choices anyway. 

             PATTY LANE
      To the contrary.  Twelve women 
      applied and Im sure every one of 
      the other eleven would love to be 
      in your shoes right now.  Husband 
      in tow.


The human in Patty Lane emerges.  Softening for the first time.

             PATTY LANE 
      Your essay about wanting to be like 
      Diane Sawyer really struck a chord 
      with everyone and your honesty 
      about losing that pageant to a 
      twelve year old girl and having to 
      wear those bunny ears?  We all fell 
      in love with you Vivian.  We 
      wouldve chosen you from hundreds.

Patty Lane walks away.

Vivian thinks about what she just said.  Realizing she was 
actually chosen.

             VIVIAN
        (shouts after her)
      How much time do I have?

             PATTY LANE
      Time?  No time.  We go back on in 
      five minutes.

Vivian bolts out of her chair and storms past Patty. 

             PATTY LANE 
      Vivian!  Youll be disqualified!

Vivian doesnt hesitate for a second, she blasts out the 
stage doors full steam ahead.

CUT TO:

INT. CASINO - CIRCUS CIRCUS - CONTINUOUS

In her gown and sash, half curled hair and full make up 
Vivian tears through the Casino, scanning the room.

             VIVIAN
      LEONARD!

INT. BAR - CIRCUS CIRCUS - CONTINUOUS

Vivian sprints into the bar.  

             VIVIAN
      LEONARD!


INT. STAGE - SAME TIME
MRS. MARRIED AMERICA 2011, saunters across the stage. Her 
HUSBAND and FOUR CHILDREN walk out to greet her.


             HOST
      Lets give her a big round of 
      applause as she takes her final 
      walk across the stage as the title 
      holder of the most prestigious 
      honor a married woman in America 
      can attain.  Mrs.  Married America!

The audience cheers.  

INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Vivian plows into the room.

             VIVIAN
	      LEONARD!

SWING TO:

LEONARD ON THE BED, NO LONGER IN HIS SUIT, STAINS ON HIS 
SHIRT, PASSED OUT IN HIS OWN URINE.

             VIVIAN 
      NO! LEONARD!  WAKE UP!!!

Vivian shakes him violently.  He comes to, groggy.

             VIVIAN 
        (tears start to fall)
      Leonard, please!  Please wake up!  
      I need you, please!  Ive never 
      asked for anything, not a GOD DAMN 
      FUCKING THING!  PLEASE!!!

             LEONARD
      What time is it?

Vivian grasps on to just enough delusion to make him worth 
her while.

She continues to shake him awake.

             VIVIAN
      Its time to go!  Ill grab your 
      suit, just please get up!

             LEONARD
      I dont feel good.  

             VIVIAN
      Leonard, you came all the way here. 
      Ive put my whole heart into this.  
      If theres ever one thing.  ONE 
      THING! Can this please just be it?  
      Please!!!!!!!

Leonard looks her dead in the eyes...

             LEONARD
      Didnt figure youd get in the top 
      five anyway.

...and then PUKES HIS GUTS OUT over the side of the bed.

Vivian takes a deep breath, regains her composure.

             VIVIAN
      Fine.  Just like EVERY OTHER GOD 
      DAMN THING Ill do it ALONE!  Ill 
      figure out a way.  Ill make it 
      work. 

She makes her way toward the door but stops short.  She turns 
and faces Leonard.  

Faces her reality, her life.

             VIVIAN 
      But Leonard?  Just one more thing I 
      think you should know.

             LEONARD
        (wiping the puke from his 
         face)
      What?

Vivian smiles, done.

Finally and officially DONE.

             VIVIAN
      Youre never gonna fuck a beauty 
      queen.

She adjusts her Mrs. Montana sash and fixes the straps on the 
Versace gown that drapes her body like a supermodel.

And walks out the door. 

INT. STAGE - SAME TIME

Cheesy, romantic instrumental music swirls through the air.  
Soft pink lighting cascades across the stage.  Ghastly silk 
flowers and a cheap white gazebo have been added to the set 
design.

             HOST
      Our first couple of the evening is 
      Janelle Thompson, Mrs. Ohio and her 
      husband Steve Thompson.

MRS. OHIO AND HER HUSBAND stand in a HUGE spotlight and then 
begin their walk across the stage.

             HOST 
        (reads from card)
      Steve is a firefighter and loving 
      father to their six children.  His 
      dream in life is to one day retire 
      and start a professional Folf 
      league.  

Mrs. Ohio and her husband approach the microphone, inside the 
gazebo.

INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

Patty looks at the empty spot where Vivian and Leonard should 
be standing, ready for their walk.

INT. STAGE - SAME TIME

The Host addresses Mrs. Ohios husband.

             HOST
      Steve, like houses and buildings, 
      marriages need foundations.  What 
      is the foundation of your marriage?

             STEVE
      Youre looking at her!

INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

Darleen, dumbfounded and unsure of what to do, sits in 
Vivians make up chair.

             HOST 
      Next up, Mrs. Texas!

Patty Lane runs up to Darleen, in a tither.

             PATTY LANE
      If shes not here in sixty seconds, 
      shes disqualified.  
        (stern)
      Its clearly stated in the rules.

INT. STAGE - SAME TIME

Amberr saunters across the stage, ARM IN ARM WITH PARDEEP.

             HOST
      Amberr is walking her husband... 
      Jack? 

The Host looks at his card.

             HOST 
      Something tells me thats not 
      right.

             AMBERR
        (really loudly)
      HIS NAME IS PARDEEP!

             HOST
      Pardeep! I dont know anything 
      about Pardeep but he sure looks 
      like a nice guy.  Pardeep, Ill 
      just ask you the question we 
      already had prepared.  When did you 
      first realize that Mrs. Texas was 
      the woman you were going to marry.

             PARDEEP
      About four this morning.

             HOST
      I see.  Well, what was it about her 
      that caught your eye.

             PARDEEP
      Her body looked very sexual and 
      fertile.  

             HOST
      Alright!  Well, Pardeep and Mrs. 
      Texas everyone!


INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

Darleen isnt sure what to say to Patty.  

             DARLEEN
      I dont...

Darleen looks across the way and smiles.

             DARLEEN 
      ...think that will be a problem.

Vivian is on her mark, smoothing her hair and ready to go on 
stage.  Patty Lane scurries over to her.

SWING TO:

             PATTY LANE
      Where is he? I thought you said he 
      was here.

             VIVIAN
      Oh, he is here.  

Patty Lane looks at her, befuddled.

             VIVIAN 
      Hes upstairs in the hotel room, 
      passed out in his own urine and 
      likely choking on his own vomit.
        (smiles)
      So, Im gonna be walking alone!

             PATTY LANE
      Ill have to check the official 
      rules, I dont know if you can walk 
      alone. 

             HOST 
      Up next Vivian Huntsman and her 
      husband Leonard!

The bright white of Vivians spotlight spills backstage. 

             VIVIAN
      I can do whatever I want to do.

Vivian steps out into her light.  Alone.  Confident.

Ready.

INT. STAGE - CONTINUOUS

Rumbles of confusion scatter through the audience as Vivian 
DOES THE HUSBAND WIFE PARADE BY HERSELF. 

The romantic music, the lights.  The other contestants look 
on in horror.

Its awkward and pathetic.

And the proudest moment of Vivians life.

She takes her place in the gazebo.

             HOST
        (confused)
      Well, I have a question for your 
      husband but unless hes wearing an 
      invisibility cloak, doesnt look 
      like hes here!

             VIVIAN
        (into the mic)
      No, hes not.

             HOST
      Well, the question was going to be 
      what his favorite thing about you 
      is.  Maybe I should get another 
      question assigned from the judges?

             VIVIAN
        (without hesitation)
      Is it ok if I tell you my favorite 
      thing about myself?

The HOST isnt sure what to do.  Patty scurries onto the 
stage, smiling at the audience, WHISPERS SOMETHING IN HIS EAR 
and then scurries right back off.

             HOST
      Go ahead, Vivian. You may answer 
      the question.

             VIVIAN
      And trust me when I say, I dont 
      spend that much time thinking about 
      whats so great about myself.  I 
      dont think most of us women do.  

             VIVIAN 
      I mean sure we have confident 
      moments, dare to dream dashes but 
      most of the time I worry about how 
      fat I look, even when Im all by 
      myself in the bathroom three 
      hundred miles from nowhere.  Or 
      about my clothes not being right, 
      even when Im at Walmart on a rainy 
      Monday morning. Thats what women 
      do.  But I think, to answer the 
      question, the thing I like most 
      about myself is my feet.

A few rumbles scatter throughout the audience.

             HOST
      Interesting answer.  Nicely shaped 
      toes?  
        (cheeses it up to the 
         crowd)
      Maybe a foot modeling career is on 
      the horizon for Mrs. Montana!

The audience laughs.

             VIVIAN
      Not really.  Theyre pretty ugly.  
      Never had a pedicure in my life.
        (deep, cleansing breath)
      My feet are what keep me on the 
      ground.  My feet run to my babies 
      in the middle of the night when 
      theyre sick.  My feet are what 
      walked me across the stage in high 
      school when I gave my valedictorian 
      speech.  My feet are the first 
      things that hit ground in the 
      morning.  Another day that I got to 
      walk on this earth.  My feet are 
      what walked me across this stage 
      tonight, alone, without my husband.  
      And my feet are what are going to 
      take me on the next steps in my 
      life even though, right now, I have 
      no idea what those steps are gonna 
      be.  

Vivian looks out to the crowd and smiles demurely.  She spoke 
so purely, so sincerely, so unsure of what anyone elses 
opinion might be.  She quietly walks to her place on stage 
and stands beside the other finalists.

             HOST
        (taken back)
      Mrs. Montana, thank you for your 
      very candid answer.  Now, if you 
      husbands dont mind, Id like to 
      have these lovely ladies to myself 
      for the next few minutes.  If your 
      wife is the lucky winner well see 
      more of you in just a bit.

The husbands leave the stage.

             HOST 
      Well, ladies and gentleman, this 
      has been an interesting evening!  
      The judges have tallied their 
      scores from throughout the evening. 
      The moment weve all been waiting 
      for will finally be here.  We will 
      crown the next Mrs. Married 
      America!  

A MAN walks onto the stage and hands the HOST AN ENVELOPE.

             HOST 
      Alright ladies and gentleman.

The FIVE CONTESTANTS grab each others hands.  The Host opens 
the results envelope.

             HOST 
      The fourth runner up is... AMBERR 
      LAKES!  Mrs. Texas!

Amberr approaches the host an accepts her modest bouquet of 
flowers and small trophy.

             HOST 
      The third runner up is... Mrs. 
      California!

Mrs. California accepts her flowers and trophy and waves to 
the crowd as she walks off the stage.

             HOST 
      The second runner up is Mrs. 
      Hawaii!

Mrs. Hawaii accepts a larger bouquet of flowers and trophy 
and waves as she exits the stage.

Vivian and Mrs. Ohio hold hands as they nervously await their 
future.


             HOST 
      And now, before we crown the 
      winner, it should be known that if 
      for any reason Mrs. Married America 
      cannot fulfill her duties or should 
      be lucky enough to be crowned Mrs. 
      Married World, the first runner up 
      will step into her shoes and become 
      the new title holder.  Either way, 
      you are both winners and should be 
      very proud of yourselves as I am 
      sure your families are very proud 
      of you.
        (to the audience)
      Are you ready for this, this is it!  
      The BIG announcement.  The first 
      runner up in this years Mrs. 
      Married America two thousand and 
      twelve pageant is... VIVIAN 
      HUNTSMAN, MRS. MONTANA!

Vivian is draped in a first runner up sash and handed an 
enormous bouquet of flowers.

Thunderous applause rolls through the audience.  

The applause may be for Mrs. Ohio, who is already in tears, 
knowing shes won.

But as Vivian waves her last good bye and walks off the 
stage?  

That applause is for her.  

Vivian Huntsman.  

Beauty Queen.

MONTHS LATER...

INT. KTMT NEWSROOM - EVENING

FADE TO:

NANCY, the local NEWSCASTER, 40s, sporting a very poor 
haircut and even worse make up, delivers the early evening 
news.

             NANCY THE NEWSCASTER
      Thanks for the weather report John, 
      glad were finally seeing some 
      summer weather.  

             NANCY THE NEWSCASTER 
      Now its time for our new 
      Spotlight on Community segment.   
      You might recognize our 
      correspondent, she made history as 
      the first runner up in the Mrs. 
      Married America pageant. Lets go 
      to her now as she reports from the 
      Eastern Montana Center for the 
      Homeless.  Vivian?

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. EASTERN MONTANA CENTER FOR THE HOMELESS - SAME TIME

Vivian looks to the camera with nervous confidence.  Shes 
wearing a simple suit but theres nothing about her, in this 
moment, that isnt gorgeous.

             VIVIAN
      Thanks Nancy.  Yes, thats right.  
      I am here at the Eastern Montana 
      Center for the Homeless.  Ive got 
      Randy here.  Hes been coming to 
      the center for a while now.

RANDY, 50s (but looks 70s) a very homeless, very toothless 
man smiles to the camera.

             VIVIAN 
      Randy, how long have you been 
      coming to the center?

             RANDY
      I cant really remember.

             VIVIAN
      Wow.  That long.

             RANDY
      Maybe. But also I do a lot of drugs 
      and drink a lot so I cant remember 
      what happened even yesterday.

             VIVIAN
        (panics)
      I see.  
        (regains composure)
      So, why do you come here?  What 
      does the center offer you that 
      keeps you coming back.

             RANDY
      Food for one.  Also, theres just 
      somethin about the people that 
      work here that make you think 
      theres a chance for something 
      better.  Makes me think I should 
      quit drinkin.  I havent yet but 
      they make me think I should, so 
      maybe I will.  I guess what I could 
      say is that coming here... it gives 
      me hope.

             VIVIAN
        (back to camera)
      You heard him.  This center is a 
      place that feeds, clothes and 
      offers shelter to many in need in 
      the area.  Theyre currently 
      looking for volunteers to help 
      serve meals.  What better way to 
      volunteer than to give people like 
      Randy here a dose of hope.

Vivian nods to the camera and smiles, confidently.

             VIVIAN 
      Back to you Nancy.

FADE TO:

I/E. VIVIANS CAR - DRIVING - A WHILE LATER

Vivian, sun kissed and wearing a sun dress drives down the 
long Rudyard County Highway.   

The sun is just beginning to set, cascading across the 
landscape, showcasing the deep golden hues of the plains.  

She smiles as she passes the rows and rows of colorful 
wildflowers that paint edges of the roadside.

INT. DOUBLE WIDE TRAILER- SAME TIME

Leonard, six pack of beer beside him, sits in an old Laz-y-
boy and watches TV.  

Alone.

Drunk.

Without hope.

A letter, finalizing his and Vivians DIVORCE is on the 
counter covered in food and beer stains.

INT. BIG FANCY KITCHEN IN A BIG FANCY HOUSE - SAME TIME   

Amberr sips on a glass of white wine, fluffs the collar of 
her track suit and stirs the pot on the stove.

An photo of HER AND PARDEEP HONEYMOONING ON A PRIVATE ISLAND 
displayed on the counter behind her.

EXT. WIDE OPEN FIELD - SAME TIME

Summer, whos lost a little weight but gained miles of 
confidence, plays a game of catch with her brothers.

INT. DARLEENS FRONT PORCH - SAME TIME

Darleen and her HUSBAND HANK (late 30s, short, slight and 
caring) sit on the porch swing, sipping iced tea and watching 
the day slowly change to night. 

Darleen hands Hank a packet from an Adoption Agency.  

Hes over the moon.

They continue to swing, blissfully happy.

I/E. VIVIANS CAR - DRIVING - SAME TIME  

Vivian pulls in front of RUDYARD FAMILY DENTISTRY AND PARKS.  

She unbuckles her seat belt, takes a deep breath and smiles 
brightly.

             VIVIAN
