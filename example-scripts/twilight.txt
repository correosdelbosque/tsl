                                   FIRST DRAFT

FADE IN:

EXT. RAIN FOREST, OLYMPIC NATIONAL PARK, WASHINGTON - DAWN 

Moss-draped.  Shadow-drenched.  Tortured tree trunks twist 
upward, reaching for rare sunlight.  

             BELLA 
     I’d never given much thought to how 
     I would die...

Suddenly, every creature in the forest is deadly silent.  Neither 
bird, beast nor insect make a noise.  A predator is near.  

Then, in the distance, hear a tiny SNICK - a twig snapping.  
Abruptly, we’re on the move.  Fast.

UNKNOWN POV - MOVING

Trees start whipping past us at a dizzying speed, branches 
are dodged with preternatural agility.  And we’re speeding 
up, chasing something.  It's exhilarating.  Terrifying.  
Finally, up ahead, we get the first glimpse of our prey --  

A BUCK

huge, powerful, and running for its life as it darts through 
this maze of a forest.  It sprints forward, but we gain on it.  
Beyond the buck, SEE the forest’s edge ahead, white sunlight 
glowing against the trees.  The buck races for the light.  We're 
just behind it, about to emerge from the shadowy darkness --  

The buck LEAPS into the light in a high arc, hovering (suddenly 
SLOW MOTION) against the WHITE GLARE of the sun... then BAM!  

The buck abruptly plummets out of frame at an unnatural angle, 
leaving the WHITE GLARE to fill the screen.  HOLD ON WHITENESS --

             BELLA 
     But dying in the place of someone I 
     love seems like a good way to go...  

Then into the WHITENESS steps the face of --

ISABELLA SWAN, 17  

Eyes closed against the sunlight, absorbing its rays.  Long, 
dark hair frames alabaster skin.  She’s a vulnerable, 
introverted, imperfect beauty.

             BELLA 
     ... So I can’t bring myself to 
     regret the decision that brought me 
     face to face with death... 

The background comes into focus as we realize we’re now in --

EXT. SCOTTSDALE, AZ - DAY

INCLUDE THE HOUSE from which Bella just emerged - low rent 
for this ritzy neighborhood.  


             BELLA 
     ... The decision to leave home.

             BLONDE #1 
     Bye, Bella!

Bella’s eyes pop open as she looks --

BELLA’S POV - MCMANSION ACROSS THE STREET 

Three tanned, athletic, blonde GIRLS hop into a convertible 
Mercedes.  Their flawless, bought-and-paid for beauty contrasts 
with Bella's pale naturalness.  They wave.

             BLONDE #1
     Good luck at your new school! 

They ADLIB superficial good wishes, “Don’t forget to write;” 
“We’ll miss you.”  Bella waves back, sweetly, but 
halfheartedly as she steps off the front stoop --  

             BELLA
     Have a good...

and trips.  When she rights herself, they’re already gone. 

             BELLA
	... life. 

Clearly, not close friends.  Bella’s grown-up demeanor and 
innate intelligence become apparent as --  

BELLA’S MOTHER, RENE, 40

-- exits the house.  Rene is eclectic, scattered, anxious, 
more best friend than parent.  She hands Bella a cell phone.  

             RENE
     It won’t work again, baby. 

             BELLA
     You put it on hold. 

             RENE
     I did?  

             BELLA
     Look.  You also called Bulgaria.

Rene pushes her playfully, they laugh.


             RENE
     I’ll figure it out.  You gotta be able 
     to reach me and Phil on the road - I 
     love saying that - on the road.

             BELLA
     Very romantic.

PHIL, 31, good looking with an athlete’s body, exits the 
house, carrying Bella’s three suitcases with ease.  

             PHIL
     If you call crappy motels, backwater 
     towns and ballpark hot dogs romantic.

He puts his Phoenix Desert Dogs baseball hat on Rene’s head with a kiss.  Phil’s love of Rene reassures Bella.  Phil heads to the old Subaru station wagon to load the luggage, while Rene slips her arm through Bella’s, clinging to her as they walk to car.

             RENE
     Now, you know if you change your 
     mind, I’ll race back here from 
     wherever the game is.  

But Rene’s strained expression tells us what a great 
sacrifice that would be.  Bella forces a smile.

             BELLA
     I won’t change my mind, mom.

             RENE
     You might.  You’ve always hated Forks.  

             BELLA
     You’ve always hated Forks.  And 
     it’s not about Forks, it’s about 
     Dad.  I mean, two weeks a year, we 
     barely know each other.  
        (off Rene’s still worried look)
     Mom, I want to go.  I’ll be fine.

But as Rene hugs Bella, we see the truth on BELLA’S FACE - 
dread, doubt, regret.  Off Bella, struggling to keep her 
facade up as she climbs into the back seat of the car...

BEGIN TITLES OVER:

BELLA'S POV OUT THE CAR WINDOW - SCOTTSDALE

Bella, IPOD earbuds in her ears, gets a last glimpse of the 
sparkling malls, chic shoppers, manicured cactus gardens... 

PULL UP AND OUT OF THE CAR UNTIL WE’RE -- 


EXT. ABOVE SCOTTSDALE (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

The McMansions get smaller as we SWEEP OVER the scorched 
landscape, baking under a hot sun.  Beyond the housing 
developments SEE the rocky, dry desert, extending for miles... 

Rise HIGHER, and higher still, until finally we’re suspended 
within the bright, perfect, blue SKY, with only an occasional 
cloud... 

Slowly, the clouds start getting more numerous, thicker, 
darker... until we’re completely immersed in them... the sun 
disappearing.  Finally, we EMERGE from the clouds to find below --

EXT. WASHINGTON STATE - OLYMPIC PENINSULA (AERIAL SHOT)- DAY

Nothing but deep, dark, green forests for miles.  SWEEP DOWN, 
finding the eerily dramatic Lake Crescent.  Over it all hangs 
the mist from the ever-present cloudy grey sky.  Everything 
is wet and green and drenched in shade... 

FIND A TWO LANE HIGHWAY along which drives A POLICE 
CRUISER... PUSH IN on the cruiser until we reach --

THE PASSENGER SIDE WINDOW 

Bella looks out, taking in her gloomy new surroundings...

END TITLES.

INT. POLICE CRUISER (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

Bella sits next to her uniformed father, police chief CHARLIE 
SWAN, 40's.  Taciturn, introverted like Bella.  Their strained 
silence contrasts Bella’s relationship with her mother.  Beat.

             CHARLIE
     Your hair’s longer.

             BELLA
     I cut it since last time I saw you.  

             CHARLIE
     Guess it grew out again.

She just nods.  Silence.

             CHARLIE
     How’s your mom?  

             BELLA
     Good.  

More silence.  Yikes.  They pass a SIGN: “The City Of Forks 
Welcomes You - Pop. 3246.”  Bella sighs.  

EXT. FORKS, WASHINGTON - DAY

As the cruiser drives through, Bella takes in this logging town - 
every storefront has a wood carving.  The Timber Museum’s sign 
is of two loggers sawing a stump.  Hunters and fishermen loiter 
by Newton's Olympic Outfitters.  The POLICE STATION, morgue, and 
City Hall share one small building...  

EXT. CHARLIE’S HOUSE - DAY

The cruiser pulls up to the old two-story house that sits on a 
creek.  A woodshed full of firewood.  There’s a small boat in the 
garage, fishing gear, an old buoy.  Bella climbs out... home.

INT. CHARLIE’S HOUSE - DAY

Bella and Charlie carry in her bags.  The house isn’t stylish 
(the only new thing here is a Flat Screen T.V.), but it’s 
comfortable, lived-in.  Lots of fishing memorabilia;  photos 
of Charlie fishing with Quileute Indian BILLY BLACK.  Plus 
several photos of Charlie with his two elderly parents.

PHOTOS of Bella over the years cover one full wall.  She winces 
at herself, age 7, in a tutu, sitting stubbornly on the ground.  

             CHARLIE
     I put Grandpa’s old desk in your 
     room.  And I cleared some shelves in 
     the bathroom. 

             BELLA
        (grimacing)
     That’s right.  One bathroom.

             CHARLIE
     Sorry.  Never had much need for a 
     second one.  

Bella’s eye lands on a WEDDING PICTURE of a much younger Charlie 
and Rene, beaming with love.  Its prominence suggests Charlie 
hasn't moved on.  She glances at him with concern.  

             CHARLIE
     I’ll just put these up in your room --

             BELLA
     I can do it --

They both reach for the bags, bumping one another awkwardly.  
Bella backs off, letting Charlie carry the bags upstairs.

INT. BELLA’S ROOM - DAY

An antique rolltop desk sits in a corner.  The room is filled 
with childhood remnants that have seen better days.  


As she unpacks her CD case, loneliness finally overwhelms her.  
She sits heavily on the edge of the bed, tears threatening... 

Then we hear a HONK outside.  Bella looks out the window to see --

OUTSIDE - A FADED RED TRUCK, CIRCA 1960 pulls up...

EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - DAY

Bella exits to find Charlie greeting the driver, JACOB BLACK, 
16, Quileute Indian, amiable with long black hair, and hints of 
childish roundness in his face.  The two of them help Jacob’s 
father, BILLY BLACK (from the photos), into a wheelchair.  

             CHARLIE
     Bella, you remember Billy Black. 

             BELLA
     Your fishing buddy.

             BILLY
     If you can call what he does fishing.  
        (Charlie scoffs)
     Glad you’re finally here.  Charlie 
     hasn’t shut up about it since you 
     told him you were coming.  

             CHARLIE
     Keep exaggerating, I’ll wheel you 
     into that creek. 

             BILLY
     Right after I ram you in the ankles.

Billy takes several rolls at Charlie, who dodges.  Jacob shakes 
his head at their two fathers as he shyly approaches Bella.

             JACOB
     I’m Jacob.  You used to play with 
     my older sisters when you visited.  

             BELLA
        (re: the dads)
     Were they always like this?

             JACOB
     It’s getting worse with old age.

Charlie then pats the hood of the truck, addressing Bella --

             CHARLIE
     So what do you think of your 
     homecoming gift?

             BELLA
     No way.  The truck is for me?


             CHARLIE
     Just bought it off Billy, here. 

             JACOB
     Don’t let the outside fool you.  I 
     rebuilt the engine and -- 

             BELLA
     It’s perfect!

She beams.  It’s the first genuine smile we’ve seen on her.  
She rushes to the truck.  Jacob eagerly joins her.  

             BILLY
     Told you she’d like it.  I’m down 
     with the kids.

             CHARLIE
     Yeah, you’re the bomb.

Bella and Jacob share a cringe, as the two men head inside.

             JACOB
     Okay, so you gotta double pump the 
     clutch when you shift, but -- 

-- OOMPH!, Bella opens the door and ELBOWS him in the chest.

             BELLA
     Sorry!

             JACOB
     Didn’t hurt.  Much. 

He laughs, good natured, and hands her the keys as she climbs in.

             BELLA
     Maybe I can give you a ride to school.

             JACOB
     I go to school on the rez.

             BELLA
     Too bad.  Would’ve been nice to 
     know at least one person.  

As she starts up the truck we MATCH CUT --

EXT. FORKS HIGH SCHOOL - BELLA'S TRUCK - DAY

Loud, belching and turning heads as Bella parks, mortified.  
All eyes are on her as she climbs out of her truck and steps 
in a PUDDLE, soaking her high tops.  She slinks toward school, 
a funky collection of old and new buildings, as we begin --


INT. HIGH SCHOOL - A SERIES OF SHOTS - DAY

-- Bella (never without her IPOD) makes her way thru kids who 
stare openly; a few brave ones say hi.  They’re all talking 
about her.  This is her hell. 
-- Bella at her locker.  Can’t open it.  Drops her books.
-- Bella wanders the halls looking for room numbers, lost. 
-- Constant stares at Bella, the outsider...
SERIES ENDS when a sweet, nerd-cute, motor mouth boy, ERIC, 
appears in her path. 

             ERIC
     You’re Isabella Swan, the new girl.  Hi.  
     I’m Eric.  The eyes and ears of this 
     place.  Anything you need.  Tour guide, 
     lunch date, shoulder to cry on.

Bella just looks at him.  Is he for real?

             BELLA
     I’m kind of the “suffer in silence” type.

             ERIC
     Good headline for your feature - 
     I’m on the paper, and you’re news, 
     baby, front page.

             BELLA
     I -- no, I’m not news -- I’m, seriously, 
     not at all --

             ERIC
     Alright, calm down.  No feature.

             BELLA
        (relieved)
     Would you mind just pointing me 
     toward Mr. Simms’ class?

He does an elaborate bow, gesturing “This way.”  They walk, he 
enjoying the attentive stares, as she cringes from them --

             ERIC
     You’ve missed a lot of the semester, 
     but I can hook you up - tutor, cliff 
     notes, medical excuse... 

INT. GYM - DAY

RAIN taps on the windows as the boys’ basketball team runs 
drills on half the basketball court.  A girls’ volleyball 
game occupies the other half.  


Bella, in gym clothes, avoids the volleyball like it’s 
radioactive.  An energetic, athletic team captain, JESSICA, 
motivates the players.

             JESSICA
     Block it, Chloe!  Yeah!  Good attack! 

Unfortunately, the volleyball heads toward Bella.  She closes 
her eyes and flails at it, SMACKING it.  It flies off court --

-- and beans a basketball player in the head.  He is MIKE 
NEWTON, good looking, affable, with blond spiky hair. 

             MIKE 
     Ow!

             BELLA
        (hurries to him, embarrassed)
     Are you alright?  I warned them not 
     to let me play.

             MIKE
     No biggie, just a mild concussion.

Mike grins and she smiles, relieved.  A BELL RINGS, class over.  

             MIKE
     You’re Isabella, right?  

             BELLA
     Just Bella.  

             MIKE
     I’m Mike.  Newton.

He looks at her a second too long, clearly taken by her -- 
Suddenly, Jessica appears, stepping between them.  Subtle, 
but possessive as she nudges Mike.

             JESSICA
     She’s got a great spike, doesn’t she? 
        (to Bella)
     If you could focus it, you could join 
     the team.

             BELLA
     You can’t be that desperate. 

             JESSICA
     You’re right.  So, you’re from 
     Arizona, right?  Aren’t people 
     supposed to be tan down there?

             BELLA
     That’s why they kicked me out.


Mike laughs, and because he does, Jessica does.  Bella just 
feels uncomfortable with the attention...

INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

FOLLOW Bella, Mike and Jessica as they carry their trays to a 
table.  Eric appears, and squishes into a seat next to Bella.  

             ERIC
     Mike, you met my home girl Bella.  

             MIKE
     Your home girl?

             ERIC
     Met her first, is all.

The boys continue their sparring as Jessica turns to Bella.

             JESSICA
     It’s first grade all over again, and 
     you’re the shiny new toy.

Bella smiles awkwardly.  Suddenly, a FLASHBULB blinds Bella.  
She looks up at the photographer, ANGELA, Jessica's sweet, 
low key, insecure friend.  

             ANGELA
     Sorry, needed a candid for the feature --

             ERIC
     Feature’s dead, Angela.  Don’t bring it 
     up again.
        (to Bella)
     I got your back, baby.

             ANGELA
        (disappointed)
     Guess we’ll just run another editorial on 
     teen drinking. 

             BELLA
     Sorry.  There’s always eating disorders, 
     or Speedo padding on the swim team --

             ANGELA
     -- Wait, that’s a good one...

But Bella’s attention is now riveted to --

BELLA’S POV - THE DOUBLE DOORS OF THE CAFETERIA 

They swing open as four of the most astounding people Bella’s 
ever seen enter (IN SLOW MOTION): THE CULLENS.  

Two guys, two girls, all chalky pale, purplish shadows under 
their eyes... and all devastatingly beautiful.  

They move through the room with effortless grace, and take a 
seat at a table furthest from Bella’s.  Bella leans over to 
Jessica and Angela.


             BELLA
     Who are they?

             ANGELA
     The Cullens.  

Jessica leans in, swinging into gossip mode.

             JESSICA
     Doctor and Mrs. Cullen’s foster 
     kids.  They all moved down here 
     from Alaska two years ago.  

             ANGELA
     They kinda keep to themselves.

             JESSICA
     Because they’re all together.  
     Like, together together. The 
     blonde girl, Rosalie, and the big 
     dark-haired guy, Emmett...

ON ROSALIE, 18, long blonde hair, model beautiful, knows it.  
Alongside her is EMMETT, 17, big, brawny, like a weight 
lifter, but a playful glint in his eye.  

             JESSICA
     ... they’re a thing.  I’m not even 
     sure that’s legal.

             ANGELA
     Jess, they’re not actually related. 

             JESSICA
     But they live together.  And the 
     little dark haired girl, Alice, 
     she’s really weird...   

ON ALICE, 17, pixie-like, rail thin, light on her feet with 
short, black hair going in every direction.  She hovers over, 
JASPER, 18, honey-blond hair, tall, lean, slightly tortured.

             JESSICA
     ... she’s with Jasper, the tall 
     blonde who looks like he’s in pain.  
     I mean, Dr. Cullen’s like this 
     foster dad slash match maker.  


             ANGELA
     Maybe he’ll adopt me.

Bella laughs, liking her... then sees the last Cullen to enter --

EDWARD, 17.  Lanky, with untidy, bronze colored hair.  He seems 
inwardly turned, mysterious.  More boyish than the others.  But 
the most striking of all.  Bella can’t take her eyes off him.

             BELLA
     Who’s he?

             JESSICA
     That’s Edward Cullen.

Suddenly, Edward looks over, as if he heard Jessica from 
across the room.  His eyes meet Bella's.  But he seems... 
confused.  Bella quickly looks away.  

             JESSICA
     He’s totally gorgeous, obviously.  
     But apparently, no one here is good 
     enough for him.  Like I care.  
        (she obviously does)
     Anyway, don’t waste your time.  

             BELLA
     I wasn’t planning on it.

But Bella can’t help but peek at Edward again.  He's staring 
at her outright now, with a slightly frustrated expression 
that unnerves Bella.  She hides behind her hair.

INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - DAY

A room of black-topped lab tables.  Two to a table.  Bella 
and Mike enter the back of the room.  Mike takes his seat and 
points her toward MR. MOLINA, the bearded, Birkenstocked, 
enthusiastic science teacher at the head of the class.  As 
Bella moves to the teacher with her class slip, she notes --

EDWARD -- his back to her, sitting at a front table.  But as 
she passes Edward’s table...

SLOW MOTION -- the breeze she creates when she passes lifts a 
piece of paper next to Edward.  We’re still on his back as he 
inhales -- then abruptly stiffens.  He grabs onto the edge of 
the table, crumbling it slightly.  No one notices.  

Mr. Molina takes Bella’s class slip. 

             MR. MOLINA
     Welcome, Ms. Swan.  Follow along as 
     best you can till you get caught up.  


Mr. Molina gestures to the only empty seat... next to Edward.  
But as Bella approaches, she’s taken aback when --

ON EDWARD’S FACE - he slowly looks up at her, his eyes coal 
black with repulsion, fury.  If looks could literally kill...

Bella knocks someone’s book bag off their chair.  Replaces it, 
mumbling an apology.  Then slinks reluctantly into her seat.  
Edward jerks away from her to the extreme edge of his chair. 

             MR. MOLINA
        (to the class, animated)
     Today we’ll be observing the behavior 
     of planaria, a.k.a flatworms.

As Mr. Molina distributes two petri dishes per table --

             MR. MOLINA
     We’re going to cut them in half, 
     then watch them regenerate into two 
     separate worms...  

Bella glances at Edward who averts his face, holding a hand over 
his nose as if he smells something horrible.  

Bella, shrinking, subtly sniffs the air, smells nothing.  
Then she sniffs her hair.  It’s fine.  She’s perplexed.  Mr. 
Molina hands Edward two petri dishes.

             MR. MOLINA
     ... Yes, folks, zombie worms!  They 
     just won’t die.

Edward takes a dish, then slides the second one across the 
table to Bella as if she had Ebola.  She takes her dish, and 
makes a dark curtain of her hair between them.  

She can see EDWARD’S HANDS under the table.  Clenched into 
fists.  Off Bella, utterly baffled, and deeply insecure...

INT. HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

-- as the BELL RINGS, Edward bolts out the door.  Other kids 
and Bella exit a moment later.  Bella looks down the hall; 
he’s gone.  She leans against a wall.  Mike exits beside her.  

             MIKE
     Need a hot escort to your next 
     class?  Or will I do?

He smiles flirtatiously, but she’s too shaken to notice.

             BELLA
     I... um, have to turn in some paperwork  
     to the office.  


He guides her up the hall.

             MIKE
     Hey, did you stab Cullen with a pen 
     or something?  
        (off her look)
     I mean, the guy’s weird, but not 
     usually that weird.

             BELLA
     I didn’t do anything.  Except sit down.

             MIKE
     Yep.  Weird.  

INT. ADMINISTRATION OFFICE - DAY

Bella enters, but nearly turns and leaves when she sees --

EDWARD sweet-talking the enchanted female ADMINISTRATOR, 
40’s.  He doesn't see Bella enter.

             EDWARD
     There must be something open sixth 
     period.  Physics?  Biochem?

             ADMINISTRATOR
     No, every class is full.  I’m afraid 
     you’ll have to stay in biology. 
        (overly concerned)
     I’m so sorry.  I can speak to Mr. Molina 
     if there’s a problem in class...

Bella blanches.  The Administrator sees her and gestures for 
her to wait a minute. 

But Edward suddenly straightens as if sensing Bella.  He slowly 
turns to glare at her with piercing, hate-filled eyes.  She backs 
to the wall, hugging herself, suddenly chilled... with fear.  

             EDWARD
        (to the Administrator)
     I can see it’s impossible.  I’ll 
     just... endure it.  

He strides out the door.  Off Bella... 

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

Bella, upset, hurries to her truck.  The many eyes still 
watching her add insult to injury.  Finally, she reaches --


INT. BELLA’S TRUCK (CONTINUOUS)

-- and closes the door.  Her eyes well... but she fights it 
back, getting mad.  She shifts into gear, and pulls out...

             BELLA
     Jerk.

As we CRANE UP ON THE TRUCK driving away, winding through forest 
roads... we begin to hear a MAN’S RAGGED, FRIGHTENED BREATH --

SMASH TO:

ECU ON A SECURITY GUARD - IN THE DARKNESS

Extremely tight on his terrified FACE, sweat dripping, breathing 
in short gasps, trying desperately not to make a sound. INCLUDE --

INT. COPPER MINE - NIGHT

-- He’s crouched in a dark corner.  But then he sees a SHADOW 
move blindingly fast past him.  He jerks around, then another 
SHADOW flies past, too fast to follow.  He BOLTS!

He runs up a flight of stairs, harsh lights from the exterior of 
the mine striating him.  He moves as fast as humanly possible --

UNKNOWN POV - ON THE SECURITY GUARD FROM SEVERAL FLOORS BELOW

UNKNOWN POV charges after him at an INHUMAN SPEED through this 
maze of pillars and walkways.  We dodge skull-crushing beams, 
LEAP from one floor up to the next, up ladders, scaffolding, 
beams, up, and up, getting closer and closer to --

THE SECURITY GUARD

-- who desperately runs for his life, looking over his 
shoulder with terror.  UNKNOWN POV is closing in on him, but 
then he BOLTS out a door --

EXT. MINE (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT

-- The guard BURSTS OUT onto a stair landing, but loses his 
footing and TRIPS, breaking through the rail and pitching 
over the side, into the air --

-- and stops, hovering mid-air, a yard from the landing.  A 
HAND grips his shirt, then YANKS him out of the air and out 
of frame with incredible strength.  His guttural SCREAM is 
choked short as BLOOD SPRAYS THE LANDING...

INT. FORKS COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT

ON A TOP SIRLOIN STEAK as it is set in front of Charlie.  He 
shares a booth with Bella.  Rain pours outside the window.  

INCLUDE the waitress, CORA, 40’s, dressed entirely in lavender.  
She beams at Bella as she sets a plate of cod in front of her.

Several LOGGERS at the counter offer Bella welcoming smiles.  
She shrinks in her seat at the attention.  Charlie’s oblivious.

             CORA
     Can’t get over how grown up you 
     are.  And so gorgeous.  Just like 
     your mom was.  

Bella glances at Charlie, who keeps his eyes on his steak.  A 
bearded, hippy logger, WAYLON FORGE, 50’s, appears behind 
Cora, leaning over her shoulder to Bella --

             WAYLON
     ‘Member me, honey?  I was Santa one year.

             CHARLIE
     Waylon, she hasn’t had a Christmas 
     here since she was four.

             WAYLON
     Bet I made an impression, though. 

             CHARLIE
     You always do.  

             CORA
     Let the girl eat her cod, Waylon.  
        (to Bella)
     When you’re done, I’ll bring your 
     favorite - berry cobbler.  Remember?  
     Your dad still has it.  Every Thursday.

             BELLA
        (doesn’t remember at all)
     That’d be great, thank you.

Cora shoos Waylon away.  Left alone now, Charlie and Bella 
both reach for the salt, knock hands.  Charlie goes for the A-
1 sauce instead.  Silence as they eat. 

A burst of LAUGHTER from a nearby happy FAMILY only serves to 
emphasize their discomfort.  Bella tries to bridge the gap.

             BELLA
     So... you eat here every night?

             CHARLIE
     Easier than washing dishes.

             BELLA
     I can cook, if you pick up groceries.

He looks up, as if confused by the concept.


             BELLA
     I do the cooking at home - in Phoenix.  
     Mom’s not great in the kitchen.

             CHARLIE
     I remember.  

He chuckles wistfully.  Concern flashes on her face.  Silence.  
Another burst of LAUGHTER from the happy family.  Charlie tries.

             CHARLIE
     How was school?

             BELLA

     Fine.  

             CHARLIE
     Meet anyone?

             BELLA
     A few people... Do you know the 
     Cullen family?

             CHARLIE
        (looks up sharply)
     Are people talking about them again?

             BELLA
     No... well, a little.

             CHARLIE
     Just ‘cause they’re newcomers.  You’d 
     think people would feel lucky to have 
     a surgeon like Dr. Cullen at our 
     podunk hospital.  Lucky his wife 
     wanted to live in a small town.  Lucky 
     his kids aren’t like a lot of the hell-
     raisers around here.

             BELLA
     ... Okay.

             CHARLIE
     I just don’t want you listening to 
     any narrow-mindedness.  

And he returns to his food.  Silence.  

INT. BELLA’S ROOM - NIGHT

Bella looks out at the rain as she talks on the phone.  

             RENE 
     If spring training goes well, we could 
     be living in Florida permanently. 


             BELLA
     Close to an office supply store, I 
     hope.  With cell phone accessories.  

INTERCUT WITH:

EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

Rene talks on a pay phone, her dead cell phone in her hand.  
In the b.g., Phil squeegees the Subaru window.  

             RENE
     I didn’t lose my power cord.  It ran 
     away.  Screaming.  I literally repel 
     technology now.

Bella smiles, missing her mom.

             RENE
     Now, tell me more about your 
     school, baby.  What are the kids 
     like?  Are there any cute guys?  
     Are they being nice to you?

             BELLA
        (a beat, lying)
     They’ve all been really... welcoming.

PUSH IN ON BELLA’S FACE, getting mad all over again as... 

FLASH POP TO - EDWARD’S FACE, HIS COAL BLACK EYES, THE FURY...

SMASH TO:

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING (BEFORE SCHOOL)

ON BELLA, sitting atop a table, an open book in her lap.  But her 
eyes are on the arriving kids, and the parking lot as they pull 
in.  She’s waiting for Edward.

Jessica, Angela, Mike and Eric kick around a soccerball
nearby.  They wave Bella to join them but she smiles, 
declining... and returns to watching for Edward.  Her face 
tells us she’s ready for a confrontation.  

INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - SAME DAY

Bella strides in... but stops, surprised to find her lab 
table empty.  Off Bella, frustrated...

BEGIN A SERIES OF SCENES OVER SEVERAL DAYS:


INT. CAFETERIA - DIFFERENT DAY 

Bella sits with Jessica and Angela who watch a YouTube video 
on their phone.  Bella gives it a cursory look, but is 
focused on the Cullen table -- only four of them.  Edward’s 
seat is empty... 

INT. GIRLS BATHROOM - DIFFERENT DAY

Bella washes her hands, then looks up at the mirror, startled 
to find Rosalie and Alice behind her.  They study Bella, 
Rosalie with chillingly cold eyes, Alice with curiosity.  
Bella, uneasy, hurries out.

EXT. FORKS COFFEE SHOP - DIFFERENT DAY

Bella exits with Angela, Mike, Jessica and Eric, becoming a part 
of this circle.  She now only glances at Rosalie’s car, a red M3 
BMW, as it drives past, noting, again, four Cullens, no Edward.  
Bella returns to her friends, finally forgetting about him...

SERIES OF SCENES ENDS as we go to --

INT. CHARLIE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

It’s neater, rearranged more attractively.  Clearly, Bella’s 
given it her touch.  She sweeps through, folding Charlie’s 
fleece jacket, straightening up.  She grabs her book bag --

             BELLA
     Dad, I’m heading out.

EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE (CONTINUOUS) - MORNING

ON BELLA’S FACE as she opens the door, and stops, dismay 
filling her.  INCLUDE the yard, blanketed in pure white snow.  

             BELLA
     Great.  

She SEES Charlie struggling with her tires.  As she makes her 
way to him, she doesn’t realize, something’s watching her --  

UNKNOWN POV - FROM THE TREES 

-- tracking Bella’s every move as she steps carefully atop 
the snow... then slips and falls on a patch of ice --  

BACK ON BELLA - fallen on her ass.  Charlie looks up.  

             CHARLIE
     You okay, Bells?

             BELLA
     Ice doesn’t help the uncoordinated.

             CHARLIE
     Came down late for the season.  
     Thought we were done till next winter.

As she pulls herself up, she sees what he’s doing.  Is confused. 


             BELLA
     You’re putting chains on my tires.  
     No one’s ever done that before.

             CHARLIE
     Because... you’ve never lived in snow?

             BELLA
     No, I mean... nothing.

He clearly doesn’t get it, and rises, wiping his hands.

             CHARLIE
     Might be late for dinner tonight.  
     Gotta head down to Aberdeen.  A 
     security guard at the copper mine got 
     killed by some kind of animal...  

UNKNOWN POV - ON BELLA AND CHARLIE, as he speaks...

             CHARLIE
     ... they’ve been hunting it for a week 
     with no luck.  Thought I’d lend a hand.

             BELLA
     Be careful.

             CHARLIE
     Always am.

BACK ON BELLA... 

             BELLA
     And thank you.  For the chains.

He sees emotion in her eyes.  Doesn’t understand it, but nods, 
heads inside.  Bella looks at the chains again, oddly moved...

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY 

It’s a snowball war zone.  Bella’s hell.  She carefully 
navigates the ice while trying not to get hit.  Eric walks 
alongside her, oblivious of her snow phobia.

             ERIC
     Yeah, prom committee is a chick 
     thing, but I gotta cover it for the 
     paper anyway, and they need a guy 
     to help choose the music --  

-- as he pulls her IPOD from her backpack side pocket, 
scrolls through it --


             ERIC
     -- So I need your play list -- who’s 
     Nina Simone?  Good to dance to?

             BELLA
     ... Is that guy aiming at me?  

             ERIC
        (gearing up to ask her)
     -- ‘Cause I want you to have fun.  You 
     know, with whoever you go with... like 
     if you went with -- AGH!!

Mike PELTS Eric with snow balls.  Bella hurries inside -- 

             ERIC
     You’re dead Newton!

INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - DAY

Bella runs in, thinking she’s safe.  Mike comes up behind her.

             MIKE
     Come on, Arizona.  Give it up for 
     the snow.

And he drops a snowball down the back of her shirt.  She 
suppresses a scream, furious.  He quickly moves to his seat.  

             BELLA
     Terrific. 

She heads toward her seat, untucking her shirt, shaking it 
out.  But she freezes when she sees -- Edward.  

Bella straightens, girding herself.  Then strides to the 
table, and confidently drops her books down, ready to address 
him.  But he looks up at her --

             EDWARD
     Hello.

Bella stops.  Stunned.  He is direct, precise, as if every 
word is an effort for him.  

             EDWARD
     I didn’t have a chance to introduce 
     myself last week.  My name is 
     Edward Cullen.  

She’s too shocked that he’s talking to her to answer.



             EDWARD
        (prompting)
     ... You’re Bella.  

             BELLA
     I’m... yes.  And there’s snow.  In 
     my... shirt. 

Feeling like an idiot, she quickly sits.  He abruptly moves to 
the extreme edge of his seat.  She’s even more baffled now.  

             MR. MOLINA
        (to the class)
     Onion root tip cells!  That’s 
     what’s on your slides.  Separate 
     and label them into the phases of 
     mitosis.  The first partners to get 
     it right, win... the golden onion! 

He excitedly holds up a spray painted onion.  Everyone just 
looks at him.  He’s disappointed by their apathy.

             MR. MOLINA
     Come on, people.  Tick tock.

Everyone sets to work.  Edward pushes the microscope to 
Bella, keeping his distance, his voice controlled.

             EDWARD
     Ladies first. 

She grabs the microscope defensively and snaps the first slide 
in, adjusting the lens.  She’s curt as she addresses him.

             BELLA
     You’ve been gone.

             EDWARD
     Out of town.  For personal reasons.

She glances at him but he just leans far away, his face 
tight.  She looks back into the microscope.

             BELLA
     Prophase. 

She begins to remove the slide.  

             EDWARD
     May I look?

She slides him the microscope.  He glances through the lens.

             EDWARD
     Prophase.


             BELLA
        (muttering)
     Like I said.

He writes it on the worksheet.  Then he takes a breath, as if 
trying calm himself, and turns to her with enormous effort.

             EDWARD
     Enjoying the snow?

             BELLA
     Seriously?  You’re asking me about the 
     weather?

             EDWARD
     It appears.

             BELLA
     No.  I don’t like the cold.  Or the 
     wet.  Or the gray.  Or parkas.  Or 
     turtle necks.  

Is that a smile playing on his lips?  For the first time, he 
seems more intrigued than agonized.  He studies her.  She still 
can’t tell if he despises her or not.  It’s infuriating.  

             BELLA
     What?

He shakes his head and turns to the microscope, switching out 
the slides.  She looks at him.  And keeps looking... 

BELLA’S POV - ECU ON EDWARD’S FACE

His cheekbones, his lips.  So perfect, like a sculpture...

             EDWARD
     Anaphase.

She snaps out of it.  Covers with a dry look.

             BELLA
     May I?
        (she looks through the lens)
     Anaphase.

             EDWARD
     Like I said.

She glances at him, and this time sees a smirk.  She simply 
holds out her hand for another slide.

             BELLA
     Slide three?


             EDWARD
        (handing her the slide)
     If you hate cold and rain, why move to 
     the wettest place in the continental U.S.

             BELLA
     It’s complicated.

             EDWARD
     I think I can keep up.

He actually seems interested.  She looks into the microscope as --

             BELLA
     My mother remarried.  

             EDWARD
     Very complex.  So you don’t like him.

             BELLA
     Phil is fine.  Young for her, but 
     nice enough.
        (re: the slide)
     Interphase.

She passes him the microscope so he can confirm.  

             EDWARD
     I’ll take your word for it.  Why 
     didn’t you stay with them -- ?

             BELLA
     Mr. Molina, we’re done.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Bella exits holding the golden onion, and practically runs 
into Edward, who’s directly in front of her.  

CUT ON THE SCHOOL BELL:

             EDWARD
     Why didn’t you stay with your 
     mother and Phil?

He waits for her answer, studying her, as if trying to decipher 
her.  She’s drawn in by his attention, oddly compelled.

             BELLA
     Alright, Phil’s a minor league 
     baseball player, so he travels a lot.  
     My mother stayed home with me but it 
     made her unhappy.  So I decided to 
     spend time with my father.



             EDWARD
     But now you’re unhappy.  Aren’t you?

             BELLA
     No... I -- I just...

Bella turns away -- embarrassed, vulnerable.  

             EDWARD
     I’m just trying to figure you out.  
     You’re very hard to read.

He’s clearly trying to read her now... their eyes meet again.  
But now she looks more closely at him.

             BELLA
     Did you get contacts?  

             EDWARD
     ... no.

             BELLA
     Your eyes were black before, now 
     they’re this golden brown or --

             EDWARD
     It’s just the fluorescents.

He abruptly turns and walks away.  As he does, Bella notes -- 
HIS HANDS clenched into tight fists.  Off Bella, utterly 
bewildered, both intrigued and frustrated.

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY

Bella heads for her truck, carrying the onion, carefully 
navigating the snow and ice.  As she reaches her truck, she 
looks across the lot --

EDWARD stands by his silver Volvo with his siblings, about to 
climb in.  A moment as their eyes meet... then he looks toward 
the sound of a high pitched SCREECH, that quickly grows LOUDER... 

Bella turns to see a VAN -- skidding on the ice, careening out 
of control, heading directly for her.  TIME suddenly fractures, 
compressing to stillness, then exploding in bursts of speed as --

THE FACES OF THE STUDENTS - in shock, seeing what's coming.
THE VAN DRIVER’S FACE - TYLER, desperately trying to gain 
control, then shielding his face.
EDWARD’S FACE - looking at Bella with horror... 

THE VAN is about to hit Bella's truck, with her standing in 
between, when suddenly, something knocks Bella down, pinning 
her to the ground.  She looks up - Edward is on top of her.  

The world around them FREEZES -- in this fraction of a 
second, their proximity is overwhelming, electrifying.  He 
breathes in her scent, she takes in his flawless face...

Abruptly, we BLAST BACK TO SPEED as several things happen so 
quickly, we, and Bella, are unsure what's going on:

-- THE VAN SMASHES into the back of Bella's truck --
-- Then SPINS around, once again careening toward her and 
Edward, then suddenly --
-- EDWARD’S HANDS are creating a deep dent in the side of the 
van's body as it shudders to a stop, a foot from Bella.  
-- Edward literally pushes the van away.

Then silence.  A long beat, void of any sound, as Bella looks at 
Edward, trying to absorb what just happened.  Edward’s fear for 
her is still alive on his face.  She starts to speak but...

THE SCREAMING begins, yelling, calls for help.  People leap to 
Tyler’s aid, run to Bella and Edward.  Bella SEES the onion on 
the ground, smashed as she would have been.  As everyone sweeps 
in, Edward moves into the b.g.  Mike and Eric run to Bella --

        MIKE
	Are you okay!?  Are you 
	hurt?! 

	ERIC
	What happened!?  Did anyone 
	see what happened?!

Amid the chaos, Bella sees EDWARD’S SIBLINGS looking at 
Edward.  But they show no hint of concern for his safety.  
Instead, they look at him with disapproval... and fury.  

INT. HOSPITAL - TREATMENT AREA - DAY

The double doors BURST open as Charlie runs in, face white 
with terror.  He dashes to a nurse --

             CHARLIE
     Bella, Isabella Swan!

The nurse points, and Charlie finally finds --

BELLA - sitting on a gurney, the E.R. DOCTOR looking into her 
eyes with a pen light.  On the next gurney over, Tyler, the 
van’s driver, lies with a mild head wound.  Charlie rushes up.  

             CHARLIE
     Bells.  Are you alright?

             BELLA
     I’m fine, dad.  Calm down.

             E.R. DOCTOR
     Just some scrapes and bruises.


             TYLER
     I’m so sorry, Bella.  I tried to stop.

             BELLA
     It’s okay, Tyler.

             CHARLIE
     It sure as hell is not okay.

             BELLA
     Dad, it’s not his fault...

             CHARLIE
     I nearly lost you, Bells.

He looks at her, his eyes welling.  Her eyes well up, too. 

             BELLA
     You didn’t.

He’d hug her, if that was who he, or who she was.  Instead, 
he glares at Tyler.

             CHARLIE
     You can kiss your license goodbye.

             DR. CULLEN 
     I heard the Chief’s daughter was here.

They look up as DR. CARLISLE CULLEN, 30, approaches, blond, as 
handsome as a movie star.  His face is kind, but pale, tired.  

             CHARLIE
     Good.  Dr. Cullen.  

             DR. CULLEN
        (to E.R. Doctor)
     I’ve got this one, Jack.

The E.R. Doctor hands Dr. Cullen the chart, leaves.  Dr. Cullen 
reviews her chart, then feels the back of her head as...

             DR. CULLEN
     You have a nice knot growing back 
     there, but your x-rays show no 
     indication of concussion.  

             TYLER
     I’m so sorry, Bella.  I’m really --

Charlie abruptly pulls the curtain between them.  

             BELLA
     It would have been a lot worse if Edward 
     hadn’t knocked me out of the way.

             CHARLIE
     Edward?  Your boy?

Dr. Cullen quickly looks back at the chart.  Bella's 
intuition flickers, sensing he knows something.  She presses.


             BELLA
     It was amazing he got to me so 
     fast.  He was nowhere near me.

             DR. CULLEN
        (smiles)
     As long as you’re safe.  

INT. HOSPITAL - RECEPTION - DAY

Charlie and Bella exit the treatment area.

             CHARLIE
     I just have to sign some paperwork.  
     You better call your mom.

             BELLA
     You told her?!  She’s probably freaking.

He shrugs and hurries off.  Bella shakes her head, pulls out her 
cell phone.  Is about to dial, but then sees down the hall...

BELLA’S POV - EDWARD, ROSALIE, AND DR. CULLEN

Rosalie is clearly furious at Edward who stands his ground.  
Dr. Cullen plays intermediary.  

             ROSALIE
     This isn’t just about you, it’s about 
     all of us -- 

Dr. Cullen sees Bella and stops Rosalie --

             DR. CULLEN
     Let’s take this in my office.

Rosalie glares at Edward as she goes off with Dr. Cullen.  
Edward adopts a nonchalant air as Bella approaches, determined.

             BELLA
     Can I talk to you for a moment?
        (off his nod)
     How did you get over to me so quickly? 

             EDWARD
     I was standing right next to you.


             BELLA
     You were next to your car, across 
     the lot.

He steps closer to her.  His expression turns icy hard.  

             EDWARD
     No, I wasn’t.

She won’t be bullied.  Steps closer to him.

             BELLA
     Yes.  You were.  

             EDWARD
     You’re confused.  You hit your head.  

             BELLA
     I know what I saw.

             EDWARD
     And what, exactly, was that?

             BELLA
     You stopped that van.  You pushed
     it away.

             EDWARD
     No one will believe that.  

             BELLA
     I don’t plan to tell anyone.  

This registers with Edward.  They’re inches from each other, 
the tension thick.  

             BELLA
     I just want to know the truth.

             EDWARD
     Can't you just thank me and get 
     over it?

             BELLA
     Thank you.

A long beat as they look at each other, angry, defensive... and 
without a doubt, attracted.  

             EDWARD
     You’re not going to let it go, are you?

             BELLA

     No.


             EDWARD
        (turns, walks away)
     Then I hope you enjoy disappointment.

             BELLA
     Why did you even bother?

He stops, a beat.  Looks back at her, unexpectedly vulnerable. 

             EDWARD
     ... I don’t know.

And he keeps walking.  Off Bella, confused, frustratingly 
attracted, and absolutely determined to find out the truth.

             BELLA 
     That was the first night I dreamed 
     of Edward Cullen...

DREAM SEQUENCE - UNDERWATER (AN OCEAN OR LAKE)

Bella swims, white skin aglow, hair floating weightlessly, 
sensually... suddenly, something BLASTS past her.  She spins.  
It’s gone.  Something BLASTS behind her.  She spins again -- 
to find herself face to face with --

EDWARD - sculpted, perfect... Bella reaches for him, but he 
abruptly springs backward, just out of reach.  She reaches 
again, almost touching him, but suddenly -- She’s YANKED 
DOWNWARD -- pulled by some force.  Edward swims away, as she 
struggles wildly, losing air -- 

SMASH TO:

INT. BELLA’S ROOM - ON BELLA - NIGHT

-- as she bolts up.  In that split second, in the darkness, she 
SEES Edward, watching her.  She SNAPS on the light -- the room 
is empty.  Part of her dream?  Off Bella...

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY

Bella stands in the exact spot of the accident.  Behind her 
on the lawn, several CLASSES congregate, gathering for a 
field trip.  Mr. Molina is in charge.

             MR. MOLINA
     Make sure I get your permission slips.

PUSH IN ON BELLA’S FACE staring at the skid marks on the 
pavement...

FLASH POP TO THE VAN REELING RIGHT FOR HER --

FLASH POP TO EDWARD’S HANDS STOPPING THE VAN --

FLASH POP TO EDWARD ON TOP OF HER, THE PROXIMITY, ELECTRICITY --

BACK ON BELLA, blushing at the memory.  Then she SEES Edward 
arrive with Alice and Jasper.  She watches him, barely noticing 
as Mike trots up to her -- 


             MIKE 
        (ala Dr. Frankenstein)
     Look!  You’re moving.  You’re ALIVE!

             BELLA
     ... Yeah, false alarm...

             MIKE
     Actually, I’m glad you’re not dead 
     ‘cause - well, that would suck, plus I 
     wanted to ask you - even though it’s, 
     like, a month away...

But Bella’s distracted by Edward.  Mike’s VOICE DIPS as... 

BELLA’S POV - ACROSS THE LAWN

Edward, head down, is in quiet conference with Jasper and Alice.  
Abruptly, he looks up, as if listening to her and Mike, though 
he’s too far away to hear.  Bella quickly refocuses on Mike.

             MIKE
     So what do you think?
        (off her blank look)
     You want to go?  To prom.  With me.

             BELLA
        (realizing, horrified)
     Prom.  As in dance.  I, uh - have to go 
     - somewhere.  To Jacksonville.  Yeah.

             MIKE
     You can’t go another weekend?  

             BELLA
     Non-refundable ticket.  Maybe you 
     should ask Jessica.  I know she’s 
     available.  To you.

             MIKE
     You think?

             BELLA
        (affectionately)
     Mike, how blind are you?

She glances back at Edward who now seems to be smirking...


INT. PAPER MILL - FIELD TRIP - DAY

Massive vats of white pulp swirl as Mr. Molina and a TOUR 
GUIDE lead several dozen kids in HARD HATS through the mill.  
Bella and Angela are at the rear.  Bella keeps an eye on 
Edward who’s up ahead with Alice and Jasper.  

             TOUR GUIDE
     And where would your breakfast be 
     without cereal boxes, coffee filters, 
     or egg cartons?  Or that cornerstone 
     of the American breakfast - frozen 
     orange juice, in its convenient 
     composite, foil-lined can. 

             MR. MOLINA
     Remember that, kids.  You’re 
     trading your natural resources for 
     frozen orange juice.

Jessica suddenly appears between Bella and Angela.

             JESSICA
     Guess who finally saw the light and 
     asked me to prom!

Angela and Jessica whisper-scream and hug.  Bella smiles.

             JESSICA
     I totally thought Mike was going to ask 
     you, Bella.  Is it gonna be weird?  

             BELLA
     No way.  Zero weirdness.  You guys 
     are great together.

             JESSICA
     I know, right?

Angela and Jessica move ahead giddily.  But Bella sees Edward 
pause by a paper vat, alone.  She takes a breath for courage 
and purposefully strides up to him.  

             BELLA
     Hello, Edward.

He glances at her, merely nodding.  We notice his FISTS clench, 
and unclench.  Bella looks at him, appalled by his rudeness.

             BELLA
     Really?

No response.  She turns, starts to walk away.  

             EDWARD 
     What’s in Jacksonville?

She turns back to him.


             BELLA
     How did you know about that?  

             EDWARD
     You didn’t answer my question.

             BELLA
     You haven’t answered any of mine.  
     You won’t even say hello.

             EDWARD
     Hello.

             BELLA
     And how did you stop that van?

             EDWARD
     Adrenaline rush.  Very common.  
     Google it. 

             BELLA
        (not buying it)
     Floridians.  That’s what’s in 
     Jacksonville.

She turns to storm off but her HARD HAT slips over her eyes, 
causing her to stumble.  He steadies her.

             EDWARD
     It helps if you actually watch
     where you put your feet.

Insulted, she keeps moving.  He keeps pace, serious now.  

             EDWARD
     I know I’ve been rude, but it’s for 
     the best.

She just looks at him like he’s crazy, then heads out the 
triple wide doors that lead to --

EXT. PAPER MILL - THE BUSES (CONTINUOUS)

Where everyone’s turning in their hard hats.  He stops her --

             EDWARD
     Bella, it would be better if we 
     weren't friends.  



             BELLA
        (wounded)
     Too bad you didn’t figure that out 
     earlier.  You could have let the 
     van crush me and saved yourself all 
     this regret.

             EDWARD
        (snapping, angry)
     You think I regret saving you?

             BELLA
     I know you do.

             EDWARD
        (furious)
     You don’t know anything.

His harshness stings her.  Suddenly, Alice appears at 
Edward’s side.  She eyes Bella with curiosity.

             ALICE
     The bus is leaving.
        (to Bella)
     Hi.  Will you be riding with us?

             EDWARD
     No.  Our bus is full.

He purposefully walks Alice away.  But he glances back at 
Bella with, is that... remorse?  She doesn’t see it.

INT. CHARLIE’S HOUSE - EVENING

Bella enters, throws down her book bag and coat, still angry.  
She starts upstairs but Charlie enters from the kitchen.

             CHARLIE
     Your mother called.  Again.

             BELLA
     Your fault, for telling her about 
     the accident.

             CHARLIE
     She always did know how to worry. 
        (hint of sadness)
     But... she’s changed, too.  She seems 
     happy.  Phil sounds all right.

             BELLA
     He is.

She continues upstairs, but glances back, catching Charlie 
looking wistfully at his and Rene’s WEDDING PHOTO.  It pains her 
to see.  Off Bella’s FACE, we MATCH CUT -- 

INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - ON BELLA’S FACE - DAY

-- as she pushes through the doors.  She glances over at the 
CULLEN TABLE, Edward with his siblings.  He doesn’t look at her.  
Anger and determination set in again as Bella joins Eric, 
Jessica, Mike and Angela.  She drops her book bag on a seat --

             ERIC
     La Push, baby.  You in?

             BELLA
     Should I know what that means?

             MIKE
     La Push beach, down on the Quileute 
     rez.  We’re all going after school.  
     Big swell coming in.  

             ERIC
     And I don’t just surf the internet.

             JESSICA
     Eric, you stood up once.  On a foam 
     board.

             ANGELA
     There’s whale watching, too.  Come with.  

             ERIC
     La Push, baby.

             BELLA
     I’ll go if you stop saying that. 

THE SALAD BAR STATION - MINUTES LATER

Bella artfully designs an architectural salad.  As she 
reaches for an APPLE, Edward is suddenly next to her --

             EDWARD 
     A sculpture in romaine.  Stunning.

Startled, she fumbles and drops the apple -- Edward catches 
it with his foot, hackeysack style, then bounces it back into 
his hand, the red of the apple, stark against his pale skin.  
He presents it to her with small smile.

             BELLA
     Thanks... but your mood swings are 
     giving me whiplash.


             EDWARD
     I said it would be better if we weren't 
     friends, not that I didn't want to be.  

             BELLA
     What does that even mean?

             EDWARD
     It means if you were smart, you’d 
     avoid me.

Edward inadvertently glances at his four inhumanly beautiful 
siblings, who wait for him, expectantly, at their table.  

She notes her own, very human friends monitoring this 
conversation from their table.  Mike glowers jealously.

             BELLA
     So let’s say, for argument’s sake, 
     that I’m not smart.  Would you talk 
     to me?  Tell me the truth?  

             EDWARD
     I’d rather hear your theories.

             BELLA
     Okay... how ‘bout radioactive 
     spiders?  Kryptonite?  Bats?

             EDWARD
        (levels his gaze, challenging)
     Those are superheroes.  Maybe I’m 
     the bad guy.

             BELLA
     Bad guys don’t save people.  

             EDWARD
     Unless they have ulterior motives.  

             BELLA
        (beat, looking closer at him)
     No.  You’re not bad.  You can be a 
     jerk, but it’s like this... mask.  
     To keep people away.  

He’s taken aback by her honesty, her insight, drawn in by her...

             BELLA
     Look, why don’t we just - hang.  You 
     know?  Like... come to the beach with 
     us.  It’ll be fun - sand fleas, wind 
     burn, salt water stinging your eyes...


             EDWARD
        (small smile, considering it)
     Which beach?

             BELLA
     La Push.  

His smile lessens almost imperceptibly.  

             BELLA
     Is something wrong with that beach?

Edward glances over at Mike - the two exchange cold looks.

             EDWARD
     It's just a little crowded.

Off Bella, as Edward walks away...

EXT. LA PUSH BEACH - DAY

It’s freezing, but Mike, Tyler, Jessica and others suit up 
for a surf.  Eric hangs with them.  Bella wanders by the 
driftwood with Angela, who takes photographs.  

             ANGELA
     I keep thinking Eric’s going to ask me 
     to prom, then he just... doesn’t.

             BELLA
     You could ask him.  
        (off Angela’s flustered look)
     Take control.  You’re a strong 
     independent woman.

             ANGELA
     I am?

             JACOB 
     Bella!

She looks up to see two Quileute boys approaching the group;  
Jacob Black, and SAM, 19.  They shake with Mike and the other 
surfers; they all know each other.  Bella joins them, smiling.

             BELLA
     Jacob, are you stalking me?

             JACOB
     You’re on my rez, remember?  You 
     surfing with these nuts?

             BELLA
     Definitely not.  


             JESSICA
        (teasing)
     Keep her company, Jacob.  Her date 
     bailed. 

             ERIC
     What date?

             JESSICA
     She invited Edward.  

             BELLA
        (embarrassed)
     To be polite.

             ANGELA
     I think it’s nice she invited him.  
     No one ever does.

             MIKE
     Because Cullen’s a freak.

             SAM
     Cullen?  Like Dr. Cullen’s family?  

             BELLA
     You know them?

             JACOB
     Sam --

             SAM
        (sharply)
     The Cullens don't come here.

Jacob shoots Sam a look, shakes his head.  Bella registers this.  
A beat, then she casually pulls Jacob aside --

             BELLA
     You want to go look at tide pools?

She offers an awkwardly flirtatious smile.  He grins, 
infatuated.  As they head toward the water...

EXT. LA PUSH BEACH - LATER DAY

Bella and Jacob wander near the water, looking out to sea for 
whales.  The surfers are out on the waves.  She nudges him, 
continuing her attempt at flirtation...

             BELLA
     So, what did your friend mean about 
     the Cullens not coming here?

             JACOB
     Caught that, huh?  

He moves closer to her, lowering his voice for secrecy. 


             JACOB
     It's kind of a legend, actually.  
     Old as any of the wolf legends - 
     you did know the Quileute are 
     descended from wolves, right? 

             BELLA
     Fur, fangs, doggy breath.  I love it.

Jacob HOWLS.  Bella laughs.  Then prompts him to continue...

             BELLA
     So the legend about the Cullens is...

             JACOB
     Well, they’re supposedly descended 
     from this, like, enemy clan.  But 
     they claimed to be different, so we 
     made a treaty with them. 

             BELLA
     Didn’t they just move here?

             JACOB
     Or just moved back.

             BELLA
        (not buying it)
     Riiiight.  So what was this treaty?

             JACOB
     If they promised to stay off Quileute 
     lands, we wouldn’t expose what they 
     really were to the pale-faces.  

             BELLA
     And what were they really?  

             JACOB
        (making a scary face)
     They're called “the Cold Ones." 

             BELLA
     What are “Cold Ones?”

             JACOB
        (grinning)
     I already blew the treaty by saying 
     this much.  

Suddenly, we hear a blood curdling SCREAM.  Bella spins just 
as Angela runs past, chased by Eric waving a dead crustacean.  
Jacob starts back to the group.

             BELLA
     Wait, cold as in unfriendly, or 
     cold as in needing sweaters?  

             JACOB
        (laughing)
     It’s just a story, Bella.

Off Bella, with more unanswered questions...

EXT. SHACK COMMUNITY ON THE RIVER - NIGHT

A collection of haphazard shacks and boat docks, connected by 
wood plank sidewalks.  FIND Waylon Forge (the hippy logger 
who used to play Santa Claus) scraping paint off his boat, 
swigging a pint as he listens to his prehistoric Walkman.  

His old DOG lies next to him as the sounds of the forest and 
river chirp and buzz.  Waylon sings along to his Walkman... 

             WAYLON
     “Better run through the jungle, do 
     do do do, whoa don’t look back...”

Suddenly, the sounds of nature abruptly SILENCE themselves.  The 
dog raises his head, starts to GROWL.  Waylon doesn’t notice.

STAY ON WAYLON, singing, working... until he looks up and 
realizes the dog’s gone.

             WAYLON
     Jerry?

Waylon pulls off the headphones.  WHISTLES.  No dog.  Waylon 
walks up a walkway... then sees a DOG LEG, sticking out from 
under a bush.  

             WAYLON
     Come on, Jerry, you old mutt...

He pulls at the leg.  It’s detached.  He reels back, stumbling 
onto his boat, frantically untying the line and pushing out --

ON THE WATER - Waylon floats, breath short, listening acutely. 

WAYLON’S POV - ON THE WOODS lining the river.  Ominous 
darkness.  A NOISE.  He jerks around.  Nothing.  Then 
suddenly, his boat ROCKS violently; he spins --

A MAN - now stands on the bow.  JAMES, 30, pale white.  A 
vampire.  

But his eyes, unlike the Cullens, are a deep, sinister 
BURGUNDY, and absolutely lethal.  His catlike movements are 
always on the edge of a crouch.

             WAYLON
     H-how did you do that?

             JAMES
     Always the same inane questions...

Waylon turns to jump over board, but TWO MORE PEOPLE suddenly 
LEAP aboard.  LAURENT, 28, glossy black hair, olive skin.  
And VICTORIA, 26, chaotic red hair filled with leaves from 
the woods.  Her eyes shift restlessly.  All three wear frayed 
backpackers clothes, and all three are bare foot.

             JAMES
     “What do you want?”  “Why are you 
     doing this?” 

             LAURENT
        (sighs, slight French accent)
     ... James, must we?

             JAMES
     The question should be, “will it hurt?”

Victoria grins and NODS, sadistically.  Then with lightening 
fast speed, the three of them VIOLENTLY LUNGE --

SMASH TO BLACK:

             BELLA 
     I tried not to think about him...  

FADE IN:

ON EDWARD’S FACE AGAINST BLACKNESS

SNAPSHOTS of his eyes, his cheekbones, his lips...

             BELLA 
     ... Not to analyze every word he’d 
     ever said to me.

INT. BELLA’S ROOM - ON HER FACE - MORNING

As she sits in front of her computer, lost in thought.  She 
shakes herself out of it and types into her search engine 
“Cold Ones.”  Several beer ads pop up.  

             BELLA 
     But I couldn’t explain away the things 
     I’d seen... or the way he made me feel.  


Frustrated she tries “Quileute legends, Olympic Peninsula.”  
An AD pops up, “Thunderbird & Whale Book Store, Port 
Angeles.”  Bella, intrigued, clicks on it... 

             BELLA 
     I needed to know...

EXT. FORKS HIGH SCHOOL - SUNNY DAY 

The sun has come out and so has the skin.  Kids are in shorts 
though it's still barely sixty degrees.  Everyone eats lunch 
outdoors.  Bella searches the crowd for Edward.

             JESSICA 
     He’s not here.

She looks down to find Jessica on the grass, doing sit ups.

             JESSICA
     You’re looking for Mr. Mysteriosto, 
     right? 

             BELLA
     No... Kinda.

             JESSICA
     Forget it.  Whenever the weather’s nice, 
     the Cullens disappear.  

             BELLA
     They just... ditch?

             JESSICA
     No, Dr. and Mrs. Cullen yank ‘em 
     out for hiking and camping and 
     stuff.  I tried the idea out on my 
     parents.  Not even close.  

Bella registers this as Angela suddenly jumps on them.

             ANGELA
     I’m going to the prom with Eric!  I 
     just asked him, I took control!  
        (hugs Bella)
     Are you sure you have to go out of town?

             BELLA
     It’s a family thing.

             JESSICA
     Oh my God, we need to hit the 
     stores in Port Angeles before the 
     dresses get cleaned out. 


             BELLA
     Port Angeles?... 
        (a plan forming in her mind)
     Can I go with you guys?  

             ANGELA
     Thank God.  We need your opinion.

Off Bella, that’s not really what she had in mind...

INT. BOUTIQUE, PORT ANGELES - ON BELLA'S FACE - AFTERNOON

-- antsy, distracted, as Jessica and Angela try on dresses.  
Bella pulls a Mapquest print-out from her purse -- it reads, 
“Thunderbird and Whale Book Store.”  

             JESSICA
     I think this halter makes my boobs 
     look big.  What do you think, Bella?

             BELLA
        (absently)
     It looks great.  

             JESSICA
     You said that about the last five 
     dresses.

             ANGELA
        (empathetic)
     You’re not very good at this, are you?

             BELLA
     Maybe I should just go check out the 
     book stores and meet you at the 
     restaurant later.

             ANGELA
     You sure?

Bella nods, heads out.  Jessica’s looks in the mirror again.

             JESSICA
     She was right about this halter, 
     though.  It does look great.

EXT. PORT ANGELES STREET - AFTERNOON

Bella heads up the street, checking the Mapquest printout.  
Finally, she sees the THUNDERBIRD AND WHALE BOOKSTORE.  

As she crosses the street, she passes an enormous LOGGING 
TRUCK on which sit four YOUNG LOGGERS, drinking beer.  One 
WHISTLES at her.  Bella ignores them, and ducks inside --


INT. THUNDERBIRD AND WHALE BOOKSTORE - AFTERNOON

Carvings, dreamcatchers and hand-crafted masks intermingle with 
the books.  Wolf images abound.  Bella approaches the QUILEUTE 
SALESWOMAN, 40.  

             SALESWOMAN
     May I help you?

             BELLA
     I saw on your website that you specialize 
     in Quileute artists and writers.  

             SALESWOMAN
     We do.  Are you looking for 
     anything in particular?

             BELLA
     A folk legend...  
        (lowering her voice)
     About "The Cold Ones." 

             SALESWOMAN
        (lowering her voice)
     You mean... beer?

             BELLA
        (tight smile)
     I’ll just peruse, thanks.

EXT. THUNDERBIRD AND WHALE BOOKSTORE/STREETS - NIGHT

Bella exits, thumbing through a BOOK she just bought.  She 
heads up the street, but then hears FOOTSTEPS behind her.  
She turns, doesn’t see anyone.  She puts the book in her 
shoulder bag, and quickly turns onto another street.

UNKNOWN POV - ON BELLA - someone’s following her.  She turns 
another corner, then another.  Each time, Unknown POV gets 
closer... and closer, until she reaches --

EXT. DILAPIDATED WHARF - NIGHT

Isolated.  Mostly driftwood.  Bella, breath short, scared, 
turns around just as -- TWO MEN emerge from the shadows, not 
vampires, but THE LOGGERS, from earlier. 

             LOGGER #1
     Hey sugar, wanna party?

She looks to her left; the other TWO LOGGERS are there.  She’s 
cornered.  She takes her purse from around her shoulder.

             BELLA
     Look, just take my bag.

             LOGGER #1
     You think we want your pretty little 
     purse?  Think we’re fags?

             LOGGER #2 
     I’ll show you who’s not a fag.

She takes a defensive stance and wraps the strap around her 
wrist to use her purse as a mace.  They chortle derisively.  
But when Logger #2 comes near, she swings it, hits him in the 
groin.  The BOOK in her bag doubles him over.  The other 
three laugh, and start to close in.  But suddenly --

HEADLIGHTS blind them.  A silver Volvo screeches up.  The 
Loggers dive out of the way.  The passenger-side door opens.  
It’s Edward.  She’s too stunned to even move.

             EDWARD
     Get in.

She finally does.  But Logger #1 jumps back into the game and 
rushes Edward’s side of the car --

Edward SCREECHES to a halt and is out of the car and facing 
Logger #1 so fast, neither the Logger, nor Bella, see it.  Nor 
does Bella see Edward’s GLARE, so chilling, so animalistic in 
its fury that Logger #1, scared, instinctively backs off.  As 
Edward climbs back into the car, Bella just stares at him.

INT. EDWARD’S CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT

Bella continues to stare.  She sees that he’s seething with 
anger, hands gripping the steering wheel, jaw clenched.

             BELLA
     What -- no, how did you find -- ?

             EDWARD
        (through gritted teeth)
     I should go back and rip their heads off.

             BELLA
     No.  Bad idea.  

             EDWARD
     You don’t know the vile, repulsive 
     things they were thinking.

             BELLA
     And you do?

             EDWARD
        (covering)
     Not hard to guess.  

EXT. BOARDWALK RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Jessica and Angela exit the restaurant as Bell approaches.

             ANGELA
     Where were you!?  We left you a message.

             JESSICA
     We waited, but we were starving --

Then they see Edward behind her, climbing out of his car.  
They freeze, agog.  He’s composed now, making an effort to be 
charming.  And they are charmed.

             EDWARD
     Sorry I kept Bella from dinner.  We 
     ran into each other and got talking.  

             JESSICA
     I - we - understand.  We were 
     just... leaving, so --

The two girls start to go.  Bella is forced to go with them.  

             BELLA
     Okay, well.  Thank you.

She starts to follow the girls.  Edward is torn, then abruptly --

             EDWARD
        (abruptly)
     Maybe I should make sure Bella gets 
     something to eat.
        (off Bella’s surprised look)
     ... If you’d like.  Then I could 
     drive you back myself.

             ANGELA
     That’s so... thoughtful.

             JESSICA
     Really thoughtful.

             BELLA
        (debates, then decides)
     I could eat.

As he guides her off, the two girls share a look, and a 
noiseless scream of excitement. 

EXT. FERRY - NIGHT

Bella stands at the rail of the boat, the wind blowing her 
hair back.  Lights from the harbor twinkle.  

Water sprays her face.  It’s exhilarating.  Edward exits from 
inside, carrying a sandwich.  He hands it to her.

             EDWARD
     Their finest ham and swiss on rye.  

             BELLA
     You’re not eating?

             EDWARD
     Not that junk.

He grins.  She has to smile.  Takes a bite.

             BELLA
     So how ‘bout some answers?

             EDWARD
     Yes, no.  To get to the other side, 
     and 1 point 772453851.

             BELLA
     I didn’t ask for the square root of pi.

             EDWARD
     You knew that?

             BELLA
     How did you know where I was? 

             EDWARD
     I didn’t.

She shakes her head, frustrated, and turns to go inside -- 

             EDWARD
        (stops her, sincerely)
     Don’t go.

He seems torn by some internal dilemma.  Then finally...

             EDWARD
     Bella, I feel protective of you.  So 
     I followed you here.  I tried to keep 
     my distance... until I heard what 
     those thugs were thinking.  

             BELLA
     What?  Wait, you... heard their 
     thoughts?  You can... read minds?

             EDWARD
        (shrugs)
     I’m thinking of getting a nine-
     hundred number.

             BELLA
        (trying to grasp)
     Alright, so you read minds.  What am 
     I thinking?  Wait -- okay now, go.

             EDWARD
     I have no idea.  I can read every 
     mind on this boat, except yours.  
        (points at people inside)
     Work, sex, money, sex, sex, boyfriend --
        (points at Bella)
     Nothing.  It’s quite frustrating.  

             BELLA
     Why, what’s wrong with me?

             EDWARD
     I tell you I read minds and you think 
     there’s something wrong with you?

He smiles, charmed by her.  But his smile fades, that torn 
look returns.  He holds onto the rail, looking out.  

             BELLA
     What is it?

             EDWARD
     I... don’t have the strength to 
     stay away from you anymore.  

She’s surprised.  And thrilled.

             BELLA
     Edward, you don’t have to.

He’s drawn in by her encouraging gaze... but he closes his 
eyes a beat, and turns back to the water.

             EDWARD
        (almost to himself)
     This is wrong.  

             BELLA
     Edward --

             EDWARD
     You’re cold.  Let’s go inside.

He heads inside before she can ask any more questions...

EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

Edward’s Volvo speeds along the two lane highway.

INT. EDWARD’S VOLVO - NIGHT

Bella glances at Edward, might ask him more questions but he 
seems to be wrestling with his own thoughts.  Finally... 

             BELLA
     I think I’m warm enough now. 

She reaches for the heater dial, he does as well -- their 
hands TOUCH.  And hold a moment too long.  An electric 
current connecting them.

             BELLA
     Your hand, it’s still freezing cold.

He pulls his hand away, but she keeps looking at it... then 
her attention shifts outside to FLASHING POLICE LIGHTS.  As 
they drive past the FORKS POLICE STATION, two sheriff’s cars 
pull away.  Charlie’s cruiser is parked out front.  

             BELLA
        (concerned)
     Dad’s here late.  Something must 
     have happened.

EXT. FORKS - POLICE STATION (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT

The Volvo pulls up.  Bella and Edward climb out.  Edward then 
sees a second car next to the cruiser. 

             EDWARD
     That’s my father’s car.  What’s he -- ?

This, as Dr. Cullen exits the police station looking grim. 

             EDWARD
     Carlisle.  What happened?

             DR. CULLEN
     Waylon Forge was found in the woods 
     out near his place.  I just 
     examined the body.

Edward darkens.  Bella is horrified.

             BELLA
     He died?  How? 

             DR. CULLEN
     Animal attack. 

             BELLA
     The same kind that killed the security 
     guard down in Aberdeen?

Edward and Dr. Cullen trade a look, subtle, but Bella catches it.

             DR. CULLEN
     Possibly.

             BELLA
     So it’s getting closer to town.

             EDWARD
     Waylon lived all the way down on 
     Queets River.  

             BELLA
     But that’s --

             DR. CULLEN
        (with a kind, reassuring smile)
     Bella, you should go inside.  
     Waylon was your father’s friend.

She goes to the door, but looks back to see them conferring 
quietly, gravely.  Clearly, there’s more to this.

INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Bella enters to find Charlie studying a map on a table, head 
in hands.  She glances through the open door to the adjacent 
MORGUE EXAMINING ROOM.  A DEPUTY crosses in and out of sight.  
Bella approaches Charlie.  He looks up.

             BELLA
     Dad, I’m sorry about Waylon.

             CHARLIE
     Known him going on thirty years.  

He’s obviously torn up.  Bella isn’t quite sure what to do.  
And so puts a comforting hand on his shoulder.  A beat...  

Then Charlie squeezes her hand.  It’s the first physical 
affection we’ve seen between them.  And it threatens to evoke 
even more emotion in Charlie.  So he tamps it down, and rises --  

             CHARLIE
     We’ll find the thing that got him.  Put 
     it down.  But in the meantime...

He opens a drawer, pulls out a folded HUNTING KNIFE. 

             CHARLIE
     ... I want you to have this.

             BELLA
     That’s probably not a good --

             CHARLIE
     It’ll give me some peace of mind. 

She sees he needs this, and allows him to put it into her 
purse.  He turns, calls out to the adjacent morgue room --


             CHARLIE
     Seth, I’m going to take my daughter 
     home.  Make arrangements with the 
     mortuary, will ya?

             DEPUTY 
     Sure thing, Chief.

As Charlie goes to get his coat, Bella cranes her neck to SEE --

BELLA’S POV - THE MORGUE EXAMINING ROOM

The end of a metal gurney comes into view.  On it, Waylon’s dead, 
white, bloody bare FEET peek out from under a sheet, resting at a 
disturbingly unnatural angle.  Off Bella, chilled...

SMASH TO:

FLASH POP TO EDWARD’S BLACK EYES

FLASH POP TO EDWARD’S COLD WHITE HAND.

FLASH POP TO THE FIVE CULLENS, SLOW MOTION, beautiful and white.

FLASH POP TO WAYLON’S TWISTED WHITE FEET

INT. BELLA’S ROOM - ON BELLA - NIGHT

-- as she turns on the LIGHT.  She hears a SNAP! outside the 
window.  She rises, digs into her purse for the KNIFE Charlie 
gave her, and goes to the window.  She looks out -- all she 
sees is the wind blowing hard.  But she’s rattled.

She closes the curtains, then reaches for the BOOK she bought 
earlier.  She thumbs through, laying the knife within reach.  

INSERT THE BOOK, “QUILEUTE FOLK STORIES AND ART.”

As she leafs through we see PHOTOS of ancient, carved MASKS.  
Comical, menacing, haunting... then she stops on a photo of a 
white mask with black eyes and a row of sharp teeth.  THE 
INSCRIPTION reads, “Apotamkin; also known as The Cold One...”

Bella quickly goes to her computer and types in “Apotamkin” 
into the search engine --

INTERCUT BETWEEN BELLA AND THE COMPUTER SCREEN

Several PICTURES pop up: tapestries, engravings, and paintings 
of creatures beautiful and horrific.  Craven, skeletal demons 
attacking villages; perfectly sculpted beauties, luring 
innocent men... it’s all murder, blood, sexuality.

THEN SEVERAL WORDS POP OUT in quick succession: 

-- “Speed.”  “Strength.”  “Cold skinned.”  “Immortal... “  
Then finally: “Blood drinker.”  

And we LAND ON A PICTURE OF A HANDSOME MAN BITING A WOMAN’S 
WHITE NECK... 

FLASH POP TO THE SAME PICTURE AS IT MOMENTARILY COMES ALIVE, 
BUT NOW IT’S EDWARD BITING BELLA’S NECK, BLOOD DRIPPING --

BACK ON BELLA - she reels back from the computer in utter 
disbelief.

             BELLA
     ... it’s not possible...  

Off BELLA’S FACE, struggling to make sense of it all...

MATCH CUT:

EXT. SCHOOL - LAWN - ON BELLA’S FACE - DAWN

She stands in the center of the deserted, green lawn.  Her 
expression tells us she's still reeling with disbelief.  STAY 
ON HER FACE, as we slowly rotate around her, TIME LAPSING AS:  

Students arrive, the parking lot fills, the morning proceeds, 
swirling around Bella as she stands still, waiting...  

BELLA’S POV - EDWARD’S CAR

It pulls into the parking lot.  He and his siblings climb 
out.  As they head up the lawn, Edward sees Bella, sees the 
intensity on her face.  He stops.  

She walks to him, eyes meeting his... her look says, we have 
to talk... and she continues directly past him, into the dark 
forest that borders the school.  

He watches her disappear in the trees, then takes a step to 
follow.  Jasper moves in front of him, Rosalie grabs his arm.  

             ROSALIE
     Edward, don’t go. 

But Alice gently removes Rosalie's hand from his arm.


             ALICE
     He’s already there.

EXT. FOREST - DAY

Bella stands amid the trees, waiting.  Then the SOUNDS OF THE 
FOREST abruptly drop out.  A predator is near.  Edward 
appears behind her.  She doesn’t turn around.  A beat.

             BELLA
     You’re impossibly fast.  And strong.  
     Your skin is pale-white, ice-cold.  
     Your eyes change color.  And 
     sometimes you speak like... you’re 
     from a different time.  
        (turns to face him now)
     You never eat food, or drink, or 
     come out in the sunlight.  And you 
     said no to the beach trip only after 
     you heard where it was.  Because of 
     the treaty.  

This last registers with him.  She steps closer to him.

             BELLA
     How old are you?

             EDWARD
     Seventeen.

             BELLA
     How long have you been seventeen?

A long beat as we begin to CIRCLE THEM.  He sees he can’t hide 
anymore.  Honesty is an enormous risk, but he has to take it.

             EDWARD
     ... A while.

She inhales.  She knew, but it’s still shocking.  We CIRCLE 
THEM FASTER --

             BELLA
     I know what the Cold Ones are.  
     What you are.  

             EDWARD
     Say it.  Out loud.  Say it.

All sound suddenly DROPS OUT.  We hear only her whisper...

             BELLA
     ... Vampire

They seem to hover in momentary stasis, him utterly exposed, her 
reality utterly rocked. 

             EDWARD
     Are you afraid?

             BELLA
     No. 

             EDWARD
        (angry)
     Then ask me the most basic 
     question; what do we eat?

             BELLA
     You won’t hurt me.  You’re different.

             EDWARD
     You think you know me?

He glares at her.  She holds her ground.  Suddenly, he takes 
her by the hand.  Starts walking.  

             BELLA
     Where are we going?

             EDWARD
     You need to see what I really am.  
     What I look like in the harsh light 
     of the sun.  

             BELLA
     No!  The sunlight will kill you.

             EDWARD
     A myth.  You need to see the truth.

He pulls her but she stumbles.  

             BELLA
     Slow down.

Suddenly, he’s right next to her.

             EDWARD
     Are you afraid?  

             BELLA
     No.

             EDWARD
     Then come with me.  Someplace where 
     no one can protect you.  Where I 
     could do what I’ve wanted to do from 
     the first moment I met you.  

Their proximity is intense, riveting both of them.  

             BELLA
     I’m not afraid. 

             EDWARD
     You should be.

He abruptly and effortlessly scoops her up into his arms. 

             EDWARD
     Hold on.

Then he flings her onto his back... and starts running.

EXT. FOREST - RUNNING - DAY

As in the opening sequence, Edward races through the forest, dark 
trunks STROBING past as he picks up speed, faster and faster.  
Bella clings to his back as it seems he'll collide with the 
trees, but he avoids them with supernatural grace.  It's 
frightening, nauseating, intoxicating. 

             EDWARD
     Are you afraid!?

             BELLA
     No!

But she clings tighter.  Terrified.  They climb in altitude.  
Higher and higher, above the fog layer.  Finally, up ahead --

THE FOREST’S EDGE fast approaches, a clearing is beyond.  The 
sunlight glows white hot beyond the trees... they're about to 
emerge from the shadowy darkness... but suddenly--

Bella finds herself sitting on the ground, against a tree.  
All is silent.  She's dizzy, tries to regain her equilibrium.  
Then she realizes she’s alone. 

             BELLA
     Edward?  Where are you?

She rises, then steps just beyond the fringe of the ferns into --

EXT. A MEADOW (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

A perfect circle of swaying grass, wildflowers and buttery 
sunlight.  HEAR a stream nearby.  Bella looks around and 
finally sees --

EDWARD, his shirt open, standing nearby in the shade of some 
trees.  He watches her cautiously.  She takes a step toward 
him, but he holds up a hand.  She waits.  Finally, he takes a 
deep breath, and steps out of the shade --


             EDWARD
     This is why we don’t show ourselves 
     in sunlight... 

As the sun hits him... EDWARD’S SKIN literally sparkles as if 
embedded with thousands of tiny diamonds.  He is magnificent, 
shimmering, like a statue carved from glittering crystal.  He 
moves toward her.  

             EDWARD
     This is what I am.

He nears, clearly expecting her to recoil, but...  

             BELLA
     You’re... beautiful...

He realizes that she’s in awe.  She reaches to touch him, but 
he immediately backs into the shadows, his skin normal again.  

             EDWARD
        (appalled)
     Beautiful?  I’m a killer, Bella.  
     This is the skin of a killer.  

His arm juts into A SHAFT OF LIGHT, sparkling again.

             BELLA
     I don’t believe that.

             EDWARD
     Because you believe the lie.  The 
     camouflage.  I’m the world's most 
     dangerous predator.  Everything 
     about me invites you in - my voice, 
     my face, even my smell.  As if I 
     need any of that...

He’s suddenly BEHIND her -- then IN FRONT of her -- then by a 
tree, DARTING so fast, we only see where he lands --

             EDWARD
     As if you could outrun me.  As if 
     you could fight me off.

He abruptly rips off a LARGE TREE LIMB, then THROWS it against a 
tree trunk with explosive force.  

Bella flinches, but holds her ground, unshakable.  

             EDWARD
     I’m designed to kill.

             BELLA
     I don’t care.


             EDWARD
     I’ve killed people.

             BELLA
     It doesn’t matter.

             EDWARD
     I wanted to kill you.  I’ve never 
     wanted a human's blood so much in 
     my life.  I’m dangerous to you.

             BELLA
     I trust you.

             EDWARD
     Don’t.

             BELLA
     I trust you, Edward.  I’m here.

She takes his hand.  He reels at the warmth of her touch.  
She leans in, drawn to him, unaware that her THROAT is 
nearing his lips... then suddenly he’s gone.

             BELLA
     Edward?

She looks over to FIND he's on the other side of the meadow, 
catching his breath.

             EDWARD
     You... took me by surprise.  
        (collecting himself)
     I don’t know how to... do this.

He moves back toward her.  Slowly.  

             EDWARD
     Me, and my family, we’re different 
     from others of our kind.  We only 
     hunt animals.  We’ve learned to 
     control our hunger... 
        (shaking his head)
     But you - your scent, it’s like a 
     drug to me... my own personal brand 
     of heroin.  

             BELLA
        (realizing)
     Oh... I thought you hated me when we met.

             EDWARD
     I did.  For making me want you so badly.  
     I’m still not sure I can control myself.



He reaches her again.

             BELLA
     I know you can.

He’s utterly vulnerable as he looks at her, searching her 
face for clues.

             EDWARD
     I wish I could understand this 
     thing you see in me.  You look at 
     me with those eyes... 
        (frustrated)
     I can’t read your mind.  Tell me 
     what you’re thinking.

             BELLA
     I’m afraid.

Stricken, he sinks gracefully to his knees in the grass.

             EDWARD
        (devastated)
     Good. 

She sinks down in front of him.

             BELLA
     Not of that.  I’m afraid... you’ll 
     disappear.  That I’ll lose you.

             EDWARD
        (amazed, elated)
     You don’t know how long I’ve waited 
     for you.

They’re both overwhelmed, taking each other in.  

             EDWARD
     And so the lion fell for the lamb.

             BELLA
     Stupid lamb.

             EDWARD
     Sick masochistic lion.

They share a smile.  Then he reaches toward her neck, pausing...

             EDWARD
     Be very still.  

She does so.  Exercising great control, he places his hand on 
her throat... it’s so exposed, so vulnerable.  The rush 
between them is overwhelming.  But Bella doesn’t move.  


He brushes his hand up her cheek.  Then lowers it to her heart...  

CRANE UP on the two of them, sitting perfectly still, as 
close as they dare... his hand to her heart...

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. BELLA’S ROOM - MORNING

CLOSE ON BELLA'S FACE.  Still in bed.  Thinking.

             BELLA 
     About three things I was absolutely 
     positive.  One, Edward was a vampire.  

She rises, goes to the mirror.  Looks at herself, worry 
knitting her brow.

             BELLA 
     Two, there was a part of him that 
     thirsted for my blood.  And three...

As she moves past her window, something catches her eye, causing 
her to BANG into her desk.  She looks back out... 

BELLA’S POV - THE DRIVEWAY

Edward leans against his car, looking up at her with a small 
smile.  She beams at the sight of him.  

             BELLA 
     ... I was falling, unconditionally 
     and irrevocably, in love with him.  

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

Jessica pops a volleyball in the air, doing practice serves.  
Angela takes a picture of her, then points her camera around, 
looking for another shot.  Eric studies some fliers 
advertising the prom.  

             JESSICA
     Monte Carlo?  That’s our prom theme?  

             ERIC
     Gambling, tuxedos and -- 
        (ala Sean Connery)
     Bond.  James -- ow!

-- as Jessica head-butts the ball which hits him in the face.

             ANGELA
     Oh.  My.  God.

Angela, scanning for a shot, has frozen.  Jessica and Eric SEE --

BELLA AND EDWARD 

-- arriving together.  All eyes on campus are turning to 
them, filled with curiosity, jealousy, envy.  

             BELLA
     Everyone’s staring.

             EDWARD
     Not that guy over -- yeah, he just 
     looked.

BELLA’S POV - EDWARD’S FOUR SIBLINGS

Emmett and Jasper look concerned.  Rosalie openly scowls.  
Only Alice offers a tentative smile.  But Jasper takes her 
arm, and as a group they turn, walk away.  

             BELLA
     Your brothers and sisters are 
     clearly thrilled about me.

             EDWARD
     Hadn’t you noticed?  I’m breaking all
     the rules now.  

Off his rakish, but reassuring smile...

             BELLA 
     How long have you been like this?

EXT. SUSPENSION BRIDGE OVERLOOKING LAKE - DAY (ANOTHER DAY)

Bella waits for Edward’s answer as they look out at the eerie, 
serene lake from the bridge.  He avoids her gaze, then finally...

             EDWARD
     Since nineteen-eighteen.  That’s 
     when Carlisle found me.  

She takes that in, it’s a lot.  But it stokes her curiosity.

             BELLA
     Where’d he find you?

             EDWARD
     In a hospital, dying of Spanish 
     influenza.  My parents had already died.   

He suddenly LEAPS UP ONTO THE CABLE RAIL and walks along, 
balancing easily, like a supernatural trapeze artist. 

             BELLA
     You’re trying to distract me so I 
     won’t ask you questions.  


             EDWARD
     Ask me anything.

             BELLA
     What was it like, the change?

He LEAPS TO THE OTHER RAIL.  She’s right, he doesn’t want to 
answer.  But he sees she won’t be deterred.

             EDWARD
     The word excruciating comes to 
     mind.  But what Carlisle did was 
     much harder... not many of us have 
     the restraint to do that.  

             BELLA
     Didn’t he just... bite?

He jumps back down.  Close to her.  Very close.  

             EDWARD
     Not just.  Once we taste blood, a 
     sort of... frenzy begins.  It’s 
     almost impossible to stop.  

             BELLA
     But Carlisle did.  

             EDWARD
     First with me, then with his wife, 
     Esme.  He found her in a hospital, 
     as well.  The others followed.

He then grins, and suddenly, LEAPS over the bridge and 
disappears.  She rushes to the rail and looks down to find him 
hanging from the planks of the bridge, grinning up at her --

             BELLA 
     Does someone have to be dying to 
     become like you?...

Their CONVERSATION CONTINUES as we go to --

EXT. OLD MILL/RIVER’S EDGE - DAY (ANOTHER DAY)

They walk along the water where dozens of lumber mill LOGS 
float, bumping against each other.  

             EDWARD
     ... No, that's just Carlisle.  He 
     would never do... this, to someone 
     who had another choice.  


             BELLA
     So Carlisle’s the reason why you 
     hunt animals, instead of people.  

             EDWARD
     Not the only reason.

He stops, looks down at her, serious, with emotion...

             EDWARD
     I don’t want to be a monster.

She nods.  Understands.  He smiles.

             EDWARD
     We call ourselves vegetarians, by 
     the way...  

Then abruptly, he LEAPS out onto one of the logs floating on 
the river, rolling it under his feet with effortless grace.  

             EDWARD
     For our kind, hunting animals is 
     like living on tofu.  It keeps you 
     strong but isn’t very satisfying. 

He jumps from log to log with amazing agility.  She laughs.

             BELLA
     Show off.

             EDWARD
     It’s not that impressive, really.  
     Anyone in my family can do this.

             BELLA
     Can they all read minds, too? 

             EDWARD
     No, that’s unique to me.  But Alice can 
     see the future.  

             BELLA
        (fishing)
     Really?  Bet she saw me coming a 
     mile away.

She notes his change of mood as he slows, darkening.

             EDWARD
     Her visions are very subjective.  
     The future can change.

He cuts off her questions by returning to shore, and 
continuing their walk...


EXT. CHARLIE’S HOUSE - TWILIGHT (ANOTHER DAY)

Water sprays from a hose as Bella and Edward wash her truck.  
A boom box PLAYS.  He perches on top of the roof. 

             EDWARD
     Come to my house tomorrow. 

Bella looks up, aiming the hose badly - water ricochets off 
the cab and sprays in her face.  He jumps down from the roof.

             BELLA
     Your house?  With your family?

             EDWARD
     It’s time they got to know you. 

He wipes down the dented front fender, then reaches under it 
and, with his bare hands, easily pops a large DENT out of the 
truck’s body.  She’s too flustered to register it.

             BELLA 
     But... what if they don’t like me?

             EDWARD
        (laughing heartily)
     You're worried, not because you'll 
     be in a houseful of vampires, but 
     because you think they won't 
     approve of you?  

             BELLA
     I’m glad I amuse you.

But then his laughter dies, as he hears something.  

             BELLA
     What is it?

             EDWARD
     Complications.

... as a BLACK CAR comes into view, and pulls up.  

             EDWARD
     I’ll pick you up tomorrow.

He heads to his car, eying the passengers in --

EDWARD’S POV - INT. BLACK CAR

Jacob, with his father, Billy, who’s expression is intense.  
Anxious.  SLOW MOTION as Edward locks eyes with Billy.  Jacob 
looks questioningly at his father.

Bella watches Edward drive away, perturbed by the exchange.  
She forces a smile and goes to greet the visitors.  Jacob sets 
up Billy’s wheelchair and Billy climbs into it as --


             BELLA
     Come to visit your truck?

             JACOB
     Looks good.  You got that dent out.   

             BILLY
     Actually, we came to visit your 
     flat screen.  First Mariners game 
     of the season.  Plus Jacob here 
     kept bugging me to see you again.

             JACOB
        (mortified)
     Great, Dad.  Thanks.  

             BILLY
        (scrutinizing Bella)
     Looks like Bella already had a 
     gentleman caller today.

             BELLA
     Just a friend.

Jacob shoots his father an irritated look, just as the POLICE 
CRUISER pulls up.  Charlie climbs out, holding two six-packs.  



             CHARLIE
     Pale Ale.

             BILLY
        (holds up a brown paper BAG)
     Harry Clearwater's homemade fish fry.

Charlie smiles, pleased.  As they all head inside --

             BILLY
     Any luck hunting that animal that 
     got Waylon?

             CHARLIE
        (darkening)
     Wasn’t an animal.  
        (off their looks)
     Found a footprint out at the crime 
     scene today.  A bare, human footprint.  

Billy seems disturbed but not surprised.  Bella is horrified.

             BELLA
     A person did that?


             JACOB
     A crazy person, walking around 
     barefoot this time of year.

             CHARLIE
     Spread the word out at the rez, will 
     ya?  Keep the kids out of the woods. 

             BILLY
     Will do.  
        (directed at Bella)
     Don’t want no one else getting hurt.

Bella looks away from Billy, unnerved.

INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Jacob, Charlie and Billy watch the game as Bella clears their 
plates, and carries them into --

INT. CHARLIE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT

Bella washes the dishes.  Billy rolls in behind her.

             BILLY
     Hoping to find another ale.

As Bella goes to the fridge, grabs a beer and opens it, Billy 
moves closer to her, lowering his voice.

             BILLY
     Bella, it might be none of my business, 
     but I don’t think spending time with a 
     Cullen is such a good idea.  

She’s taken aback, but hands him the beer, smiles politely.

             BELLA
     I’m sorry but... I think you’re right.  
     It might be none of your business.

             BILLY
     Just that the Cullens have a pretty 
     dicey reputation on the rez.  

             BELLA
     I know.  In fact, I know a lot.  
     Maybe more than you. 

             BILLY
        (angry)
     More than Charlie?  ‘Cause he has a 
     right to know.

She looks away, busying herself with another dish.


             BILLY
     Bella, it almost killed him when 
     you and your mom left.  He wanted 
     to go with you but he had to take 
     care of his folks.  Now, you’re all 
     the family he has left.  

This lands with her.  But she regroups, turns to him calmly.

             BELLA
     I think this still falls under the 
     category of my business. 

             BILLY
     Bella, people are dying.

             BELLA
        (appalled)
     The Cullens have nothing to do with that.

             BILLY
     It wasn’t natural.  They’re not natural.

She turns away from him, but he abruptly grabs her arm.  She 
drops a dish.  It SHATTERS --  

Charlie quickly enters, sees Billy’s hand on her arm, just 
before Billy releases her.

             CHARLIE
     Everything okay?  

She waits for Billy; is he going to talk?  He forces a smile.

             BILLY
     I should never help out in the 
     kitchen.  Things break every time.

He rolls out.  Bella shrugs, innocently, and returns to the 
dishes.  Charlie lets it go and exits.  Off Bella, pensive...

DISSOLVE TO:

DREAM SEQUENCE - UNDERWATER

Bella floats, face to face with Edward, only their hands 
touching, but their bodies are nearing, so close, so sensual... 

Suddenly, EDWARD IS YANKED DOWNWARD!  Something has him, pulling 
him down.  Bella desperately swims toward him, but he’s quickly  
disappearing into the darkness.  Off her agonized face...

SMASH TO:

INT. BELLA’S ROOM - ON BELLA - MORNING

-- as her eyes pop open... and relief sweeps over her as she 
realizes it was just a dream.  But it haunts her as she rises...

EXT. OLYMPIC PENINSULA - ROAD - DAY

AERIAL SHOT of the forest as we sweep over its lush green 
expanse, to FIND Edward's Volvo speeding along, very fast.  

The Volvo finally turns off the paved highway and onto a long 
serpentine dirt road.  FOLLOW THE CAR until, finally, it 
reaches a small meadow, in the center of which sits --

EXT. CULLEN HOUSE - DAY

A timeless graceful house.  The Volvo pulls up and Bella 
climbs out, surprised.

             BELLA
     It’s... wonderful.

             EDWARD
     You expected turrets, dungeons and moats?  

             BELLA
     No... not moats.

He takes her hand.  She girds herself.  They head inside.

INT. CULLEN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Edward guides Bella into the large, bright house.  Walls of 
glass look out on the river.  Everything’s open and white.  
Historical objects are tastefully placed throughout.  

HEAR Verdi’s “La Traviata: Libiamo ne' lieti calici” coming from 
another room.  Bella is enraptured.

             BELLA
     It’s so light and open. 

             EDWARD
     It's the one place we never have to hide.

We then notice CLANGING coming from the kitchen.  Edward 
shakes his head.

             EDWARD
     I told them not to do this.


INT. CULLEN HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

Verdi’s opera BLASTS Bella and Edward who enter to find the 
kitchen in full swing.  Dr. Cullen, Emmett, Rosalie, and ESME 
prepare elaborate platters of Italian pastas and antipasti.  

They move at a dizzying but graceful speed.  Esme rolls out a 
pizza dough and fans tomatoes around it in an instant.  Dr. 
Cullen FLINGS a knife to Emmett who barely looks up to catch 
it, as they chop veggies blindingly fast.  Only Rosalie stirs a 
pot at normal speed, disinterested.  

Esme sees Bella and stops, emanating maternal warmth.  Her 
heart-shaped face and billows of hair are reminiscent of the 
silent-movie era. 

             ESME
     Bella, Bella, Bella!  We’re making 
     Italiano for you.  

             EDWARD
     This is Esme, my mother for all 
     intents and purposes.  

             BELLA
     Bon giorno?

             ESME
     Molto bene!  

             DR. CULLEN
     You’ve given us an excuse to use 
     the kitchen for the first time.

             ESME
     I hope you’re hungry.

             BELLA
     Oh, absolutely --

             EDWARD
     She already ate.

Bella shoots him a look, but something SHATTERS.  Rosalie has 
thrown down a bowl and now strides out --

             ROSALIE
     Perfect.

INT. LIVING ROOM (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

-- Bella exits behind Rosalie, trying to explain.  The 
other’s follow -- 


             BELLA
     I just assumed -- because you don’t 
     eat, you know...

             ESME
     Of course.  That was very considerate 
     of you.

             EDWARD
        (re: Rosalie)
     Ignore her.  I do.

             ROSALIE
     Yes, let’s keep pretending this isn’t 
     dangerous for all of us.  

             BELLA
     I would never, ever tell anyone.

             DR. CULLEN
        (reassuring)
     She knows that. 

             EMMETT
     The problem is, you two have gone 
     public now, so...

             ESME
     Emmett.

             ROSALIE
     No, she should know.
        (to Bella)
     The entire family will be 
     implicated if this ends badly.  

             BELLA
     ... Badly?

This hangs in the air, uncomfortably.  Edward can’t look at her.

             BELLA
        (realizing)
     Oh.  Badly. Like, where I become a 
     meal.

Esme chokes back laughter.  Edward grins.  Wraps his arm 
around Bella.  Even Emmett has to chuckle.

Rosalie, exasperated, heads back into the kitchen.  Emmett 
shrugs, goes after her.

             ALICE 
     Hi, Bella!

ANGLE ON THE TOP OF THE STAIRCASE

A chipper Alice stands beside Jasper.  She runs down in a 
supernatural streak to come to a sudden graceful stop in 
front of Bella.  She bounces forward to kiss Bella's cheek.  

             ALICE
     I’m Alice.  You do smell good. 

             EDWARD
     Alice.

             ALICE
     It’s alright, Bella and I are going 
     to be great friends.  

             BELLA
        (extending her hand)
     And you’re Jasper, right?

             JASPER
     Pleasure to meet you.

But he shies away from her hand.  

             ALICE
        (gently encouraging)
     You won’t hurt her, Jasper.

He isn’t so sure.  Edward takes Bella’s hand instead.

             EDWARD
     I’ll give you a tour of the house. 

             ALICE
        (with meaning)
     I’ll see more of you soon. 

Edward shoots Alice a look, which Bella catches before he 
guides her up the stairs.  As they ascend, Bella takes in the 
eclectic ART PIECES from around the world, Ethiopian crosses, 
Dresden China, Asian scrolls.  They reach --

THE LANDING - to FIND a wall of dozens of artistically arrayed 
silk squares with tassels.  Bella looks closer. 

             BELLA
     Graduation caps?

             EDWARD
     A private joke.  We matriculate a lot.

             BELLA
     What a nightmare, repeating high school. 



             EDWARD
     True, but the younger we start out in a 
     new place, the longer we can stay there.

She shivers at the thought of it, as they continue on...

INT. EDWARD'S ROOM - DAY

             EDWARD
     ... and this is my room.

Bella enters to find a wall of glass doors open to a deck, with 
the river beyond.  The rest is floor to ceiling CD's, vinyl, 8-
track tapes, etc., with a sophisticated I-pod/stereo set up.  

             BELLA
     So you’re obsessed with music.  But...
        (looking around)
     No bed?

             EDWARD
	No sleep.

             BELLA
     Ever?

             EDWARD
     No nightmares, no drool, no snoring.

She considers this, as she runs a hand along a wall of CD’s, 
studying the titles.

             EDWARD
     Do you have any favorites?

             BELLA
     Depends.  Alternative?  Jazz?  
     Sixties, seventies...

             EDWARD
     Ooh, she knows her music.  Alright, 
     nineties.  Eighteen-nineties.  Classical.

             BELLA
     I’d have to say... Debussy.

He looks at her, surprised, smiles.  

             EDWARD
     My favorite, too. 

Off their connection, he pulls out a CD and puts it on.  A 
solo piano version of CLAIR DE LUNE begins to play.

He moves to her, taking her hand, then he starts to turn her 
in a pirouette, dancing with her - but she breaks off and 
backs away.

             BELLA
     No dancing.

             EDWARD

     Ever? 

             BELLA
     No tripping, no falling, no derision. 

             EDWARD
        (mischievously)
     I can always make you.

             BELLA
     You don’t scare me.

             EDWARD
     You really shouldn't have said that.

He grins, a low GROWLING SOUNDS in the back of his throat.  
She laughs and backs out the door, onto --

EXT. EDWARD’S ROOM - DECK (CONTINUOUS)

-- Bella backs up to the rail.  Edward appears in the 
doorway, shifting into a half-crouch, about to pounce.  

             BELLA
     Don’t you dare --

Suddenly, she's airborne as he tackles her and they FLY OFF THE 
DECK... then she finds herself --

IN A TREE - in his arms.  When she realizes where she is, she 
laughs, delighted.  It’s infectious, he laughs heartily, too...

INT. CULLEN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME

Esme and Dr. Cullen look out the window.  Edward’s LAUGHTER 
filters inside to them; Esme, in turn, smiles.

CUT AWAY TO:

             ESME
     She’s brought him to life.

             DR. CULLEN
     He’s been alone too long... but 
     this.  It won’t end well.


             ESME
     Alice has been wrong before.

             DR. CULLEN
     Not often.

Esme turns to Dr. Cullen, gentle but absolutely firm.

             ESME
     Carlisle.  Bella is what he wants.  
     It will work out.  Somehow.  

Dr. Cullen smiles at her with love, then takes her hand as 
they look back out the window...

EXT. TREE - SAME

Edward looks Bella in the eye. 



     

             EDWARD
     Trust me?
       
     		   BELLA
	No. 

             EDWARD
     Then close your eyes.

She does, warily.  He grips her more firmly, then LEAPS them to 
another tree like a flying squirrel!  Then, again, to the TOP of 
another tree.  He easily gets a foothold, while holding Bella.  

             EDWARD
     Open.

She does... to the most astonishing bird’s eye VIEW of the 
valley, river, and the mountains beyond.  CAMERA whirls around 
them allowing us a 360 degree view of their surroundings.  Off 
Bella’s intoxicated face...

CUT AWAY TO:

CLOSE ON A GERMAN SHEPHERD

Moving fast, tracking.  INCLUDE CHARLIE holding the leash --

EXT. FOREST - DAY

-- It’s a hunting party, several dogs, half a dozen armed men.  

             DEPUTY
     Chief, we got something --

Charlie hurries to the Deputy.  They gather around --


A FOOTPRINT.  The dogs start pulling them in a certain 
direction.  As the posse takes off at a sprint --

UNKNOWN POV - ON CHARLIE, FROM A DISTANCE

We watch Charlie and the posse move away... REVERSE to find --

JAMES - ATOP A KNOLL, WATCHING THEM

Laurent stands next to him.  Victoria jogs up.

             VICTORIA
     They took the bait.  

             JAMES
        (snickering derisively)
     By tomorrow they’ll be half way to 
     Winnipeg. 

Victoria lasciviously grabs James’ shirt.  Pulls him to her.

             VICTORIA
     I love when men chase me.

He grins, then starts taking off her clothes.  They pull each 
other toward the woods with carnal lust.  It barely registers 
with Laurent, who continues to watch the posse with concern. 

INT. FORKS COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT

Bella hurries in, trying to keep the joy on her face in check... 
with minimal success.  She passes a booth where Mike sits with 
several of his basketball TEAMMATES.  

             MIKE
     Yo, Arizona.  Wait up...
        (he rises, pulls her aside)
     So.  You and Cullen.  

She shrugs, non-committal, but can’t entirely hide a smile.  

             MIKE
     I don’t like it.  The guy looks at you 
     like you’re something to eat.  

A laugh escapes her.  He’s miffed.  She stifles it.

             BELLA
     Thanks for the concern.  I gotta go.  
     Chief’s waiting. 

She hurries to Charlie’s booth and slides in.


             BELLA
     Sorry I’m late.  Got caught up in a 
     biology project.  

The lavender-attired Cora sets a top sirloin steak in front 
of Charlie, and plate of seafood in front of Bella.

             CHARLIE
     Ordered you the seafood combo.

             BELLA
     Order one for yourself next time.  
     You should cut back on the steak.

             CHARLIE
     I’m healthy as a horse.

             CORA
     Say Chief, boys want to know, you 
     find anything out in the woods today?

Charlie’s aware of the LOGGERS at the counter listening, too.

             CHARLIE
     Tracked some prints.  But it looks like 
     the suspect’s moving east, out of the 
     area.  Probably long gone by now.

             CORA
        (relieved)
     Hope he stays gone.  

She moves off.  Charlie and Bella pass each other the salt, 
butter for bread, A-1 sauce, etc., with an easy rhythm now.  

             CHARLIE
     Your friends are flagging you.

She turns to see Mike and the guys horsing around, straws in 
their noses, making silly faces at her.  She smiles.

             CHARLIE
     It’s okay you wanna join them.  I’m 
     just gonna turn in early anyway.

             BELLA
     Yeah, me, too. 

             CHARLIE
     It’s a Friday night.  Go out.  The 
     Newton boy’s got a big smile for 
     you.  Nice family, the Newtons.

             BELLA
     He’s just a friend.


             CHARLIE
     None of the boys in town interest you?

             BELLA
     We’re not really going to talk 
     about boys, are we?

             CHARLIE
     Just... you should be around people.  
     I leave you alone too much.

             BELLA
        (with genuine affection)
     I’ve never minded being alone.  Guess 
     I’m a lot like my dad that way. 

Charlie smiles.  These two have come a long way.  Cora returns --

             CORA
     Berry cobbler, two forks.

She sets it between them.  Off them, both reaching for forks...

INT. BELLA'S ROOM - NIGHT

Bella, dressed for bed, looks out the window as she talks on the 
phone with Rene.  Bella’s euphoria still lingers in her eyes...

             BELLA
     So spring training’s going well?

INTERCUT WITH:

EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - NIGHT 

Rene reclines in the empty stands, talking on her cell, as Phil 
does some late night batting practice.  She stifles a tired yawn.

             RENE
     Phil’s working hard.  We’re looking 
     around for a house to rent, in case 
     it becomes permanent.  You’d like 
     Jacksonville, baby.  

             BELLA
     Actually, Forks is kind of growing on me. 

             RENE
        (stops, knows there’s more)
     Could... a guy have something to do 
     with that?

             BELLA
        (small smile)
     Maybe...


             RENE
     Tell me everything!  Jock?  Indie?  
     Nerd?  Bet he’s smart.  Is he smart?

             BELLA
        (trying to avoid lies)
     Well... he is kind of a history buff.

-- this as she turns to find --

EDWARD LYING ON HER BED, smiling.  She nearly drops the phone.

             BELLA
     I, uh... have to go.

             RENE
     No way, we gotta talk boys.  Are 
     you being safe?

Edward shoots her a look, he heard that.  She’s mortified.

             BELLA
     I’ll call you later, Mom. 

STAY ON BELLA who hangs up.

             BELLA
     How did you get in here?

             EDWARD
     I used the key.  As always.

             BELLA
     You’ve been here before?

             EDWARD
     What else is there to do at night? 

She pushes him.  He grabs her hand and playfully pulls her 
onto the bed, wrestling as --

             BELLA
     You’re a peeping Tom!  Perv!

             EDWARD
     Shh!  The Chief will hear you!

But the electricity of their physical contact quickly 
overwhelms them, their laughter quieting.  He studies her face.

             EDWARD
     I just... like watching over you.  
     You’re fascinating when you sleep.  

He raises his fingers to her lips, sending a thrill up her spine.

             EDWARD
     There's something I'd like to try. 

She nods, bedazzled by him.  He takes her face in his hands, 
hesitates to test himself, then he softly kisses her...  

What neither of them is prepared for is her response.  Her 
breath comes in a wild GASP.  Her fingers knot in his hair, 
clutching him to her.  Lips part as she breathes his scent...

Then his hands gently, but forcefully push her face back.  She 
opens her eyes to see that his eyes are wild, jaw clenched in 
acute restraint.  He holds her face just inches from his.  

             BELLA
        (mortified)
     Oh... I’m... oh.

             EDWARD
     Wait a moment, please.  

He relaxes slightly, and releases her blushing face.

             EDWARD
     I’m stronger than I thought.  

             BELLA
     Wish I could say the same.  I’m so 
     embarrassed.

             EDWARD
     Don’t be.  But we have to be careful.
        (serious)
     I can never lose control with you.  Ever.  

She nods, then carefully lies on his chest.  He wraps his arms 
around her.  Off the two of them...

INT. CHARLIE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

Bella enters to find Charlie cleaning a rifle.  He starts to 
say hello but she just blurts out --  

             BELLA
     I have a date with Edward Cullen.

He suddenly looks like he’s having an aneurysm.  

             CHARLIE
     Edward Cullen is... he’s too old 
     for you.

             BELLA
     We’re both juniors.  I thought you 
     liked the Cullens.  


             CHARLIE
     And I thought you weren’t interested in 
     any of the boys in town.  

             BELLA
        (fumbling)
     Edward doesn’t live “in town.”  And 
     it’s in the early stage and -- 
     whatever, he’s outside right now.

             CHARLIE
     Now?  He’s out there?

             BELLA
     He wants to meet you.  Officially. 

             CHARLIE
     Good.

Charlie strides to the door, still holding the rifle -- Bella 
stops him, gently taking the rifle from him --

             BELLA
     Be nice, okay?  He’s... important.

Charlie looks at her, softens.  He gives his daughter a 
reassuring nod... then the door to REVEAL Edward in a parka 
and gloves.  

             EDWARD
     Chief Swan.  I wanted to formally 
     introduce myself.  I’m Edward.

Edward extends his hand.  Charlie takes it, but grunts a 
hello, resisting him.

             EDWARD
     I won’t keep Bella out late 
     tonight.  We’re just going to go 
     play baseball with my family.

             CHARLIE
     Bella’s going to play baseball?

Bella’s equally surprised, but hides it.

             EDWARD
     Yes, sir, that’s the plan.

             CHARLIE
     Huh.  Well.  More power to you, I guess.

             EDWARD
        (looks him in the eyes)
     She’ll be safe with me, sir, I promise.

No one could doubt his sincerity.  Charlie begrudgingly nods.  
But as Edward exits... Charlie holds Bella back.

             CHARLIE
        (sotto)
     You got that knife I gave you?

             BELLA
     Dad.

EXT. CHARLIE’S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

Edward and Bella climb into a massive JEEP parked in the drive.

             EDWARD
        (amused)
     Your father thinks you should go to 
     an all-girl’s school.

             BELLA
     No fair, reading Dad’s mind. 

As they climb in the Jeep --

             BELLA
     And since when do vampires like baseball?  

             EDWARD
     It's the American pastime.  Plus, 
     there's a thunderstorm coming.  It’s the 
     only time we can play.  You'll see why.

EXT. CLEARING IN WOODS - NIGHT

Storm clouds feather a FULL MOON, as Bella emerges from the 
forest with Edward.  She takes in a beautiful baseball diamond, 
set into an enormous field in the lap of the Olympic peaks.  

The Cullens warm up, throwing a NIGHT-BALL back and forth, 
too fast to see.  There’s a bucket of glowing balls, and a 
pile of aluminum bats.  Esme and Emmett come to greet Bella.  
Rosalie strides off toward the field.  Esme hugs Bella.

             ESME
     Good thing you’re here.  We need a 
     umpire.  

             EMMETT
        (big crooked grin)
     She thinks we cheat.

             ESME
     I know you cheat.  Call ‘em as you 
     see ‘em, Bella. 



Alice then RACES over at a blinding speed, with a sudden stop.

             ALICE
     It’s time.

-- Just as a deep RUMBLE of thunder shakes the forest.

BEGIN MONTAGE - THE GAME

And it's extraordinary.  Bella stays by Esme who plays 
catcher.  Alice pitches with lightning-fast speed.  Edward 
and Emmett take positions in the outfield. 

-- ROSALIE SMASHES the ball with the aluminum bat. It CRACKS 
like thunder -- and is followed directly by real THUNDER.  

             BELLA
        (to Esme)
     Now I get why you need the thunder.

Bella looks at Rosalie’s bat, tossed on the ground.  The last 
four inches are DEFORMED by the force of her hit.

The ball SHOOTS like a meteor deep into the forest.  Edward 
disappears after it.

             BELLA
     That has to be a home run.

             ESME
     Edward’s very fast.  

Rosalie darts around the bases, almost a blur -- Edward races 
out of the forest with the ball and WHIPS it to home plate.  
WHAP!  Esme catches it a millisecond before Rosalie slides in.

             BELLA
     Yer out!

-- DR. CULLEN hits a line drive.  Edward and Emmett race for 
the catch, DIVING 15 feet and COLLIDING with such might that 
it sounds like enormous boulders falling.  They both miss the 
ball -- Dr. Cullen is safe on second. 

-- JASPER WHACKS the next pitch -- EMMETT runs up the side of 
a tree to catch it. 

-- EDWARD’S TEAM comes in to bat AD LIBBING insults and taunts 
like street ballplayers.  The others give back the same.

Bella is amazed watching hit after amazing hit, catch after 
phenomenal catch, runs, tag outs -- the balls fly, some 
literally ripping apart -- bent and twisted bats stack up.


END MONTAGE as... DR. CULLEN SMASHES the ball into the forest.  
But Edward stops from chasing it when Alice suddenly GASPS.  

             ALICE
     I didn’t see them...  

They all stop.  Edward is immediately at Bella's side.  The 
family instantly gather at home plate.  

             ALICE
     They’re traveling so quickly --

             ROSALIE
     You said they left the county -- 

             ALICE
     They did, but they heard us...
        (looking at Edward)
     They're coming.  

             EDWARD
        (to Bella)
     Put your hair down --

             ROSALIE
     Like that’ll help.  I could smell 
     her from across the field.  

Edward ignores Rosalie as he arranges Bella’s hair.

             EDWARD
     I shouldn’t have brought you here.  
     I’m so sorry.

She’d ask why, but suddenly, they all turn as one toward --

THE EDGE OF THE FOREST

There’s a faint rustle... then James, Victoria and Laurent 
emerge.  As they near, Bella SEES their bare feet, then the 
deep BURGUNDY of their eyes.  Laurent holds up the baseball.  

             LAURENT
     I believe this belongs to you.

He tosses the ball (his casual toss is still blindingly fast) 
to Dr. Cullen who easily catches it and smiles politely.

             DR. CULLEN
     Thank you.

             LAURENT
     Could you use three more players?


             DR. CULLEN
     Of course.

             LAURENT
     I’m Laurent.  This is Victoria.  
     And James.

Dr. Cullen nods hello, tosses the ball to Victoria.  This 
begins what appears to be a casual game between the two 
clans, while exchanging pleasantries.  But the underlying 
tension is thick.

Bella sees that Edward’s eyes are locked onto James.  Edward 
tosses James the bat, who then takes the plate.  Edward 
catches to stay close to Bella.  The others take the field, 
yelling across the diamond to each other as --

             DR. CULLEN
     I’m afraid your hunting activities have 
     caused something of a mess for us.  

             LAURENT
     Our apologies.  We didn’t realize 
     the territory had been claimed. 

Alice pitches the ball -- James SLAMS it -- right into center 
fielder Emmett’s hand with a THWAP.  SEE James smile ever so 
slightly, delighted at the discovery of worthy opponents.

Lightening fast, Emmett whips the ball to Esme, who whips it 
to Dr. Cullen, who whips it to Jasper at first base, all as -- 

             LAURENT
     What exactly is your hunting range?

             DR. CULLEN
     The Olympic Peninsula.  

             LAURENT
     It won’t be a problem now.  The humans 
     were tracking us, but we led them East --

But as Jasper THROWS the ball, past Bella, to Edward... 

CLOSE ON BELLA -- IN SLOW MOTION as the wind from the ball 
ruffles her hair, carrying her scent, which floats to --

JAMES -- suddenly his head WHIPS around at her and he lurches 
into a crouch, his nostrils flaring, excitedly.  

             JAMES
     You brought a snack.

EDWARD springs in front of Bella, baring his teeth.  A truly 
menacing, feral SNARL rips from his throat.  James GROWLS back.

Dr. Cullen is immediately between the two.  The rest of the 
Cullens form a protective ring around Bella.


             DR. CULLEN
     The girl is with us.

             LAURENT
        (trying to defuse situation)
     We won’t harm her.  

             EMMETT
        (hungry for battle)
     Just try it.

             DR. CULLEN
     I think it best if you leave.

             LAURENT
     Yes, I can see the game is over.  
     We’ll go now.  James?

But James’ eyes don’t leave Edward’s.  Laurent puts a hand on 
James’ shoulder, and finally, James backs into the woods with 
his cohorts, disappearing.  Once they’re gone, Esme 
immediately gathers up the bats--  

             DR. CULLEN
     Get her out of here.  We’ll follow them.  

Dr. Cullen, Jasper and a resentful Rosalie race off after the 
three vampires.  Edward scoops Bella up as we --

EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - ON THE JEEP - NIGHT

Edward whips Bella into the jeep.  Alice is already in the 
back seat.  Emmett straps Bella in -- 

SMASH TO:

             BELLA
     They said they were leaving --

             EDWARD
     They lied.  James is a tracker.  I saw 
     his mind.  The hunt is his obsession, 
     and my reaction set him off --  

-- The tires spin as Edward WHIPS the jeep around --

             EDWARD
     -- We’re his biggest challenge - a large 
     clan of strong fighters all protecting 
     one vulnerable element.  You.
        (dark with disgust)
             

             EDWARD
     I just made this his most exciting 
     game ever.  He’s euphoric.

Bella blanches with the dawning realization of what she has just 
wrought upon on them all as...

THE JEEP CAREENS DOWN THE DIRT MOUNTAIN ROAD

A jolting, death defying ride, SPLASHING through creeks, until 
they reach --

EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

THE JEEP speeds wildly up the road at 110mph.  Emmett stands 
in the rear seat like a sentry.  Alice watches out, as well.  
Bella gets her bearings.

             BELLA
     Forks is the other direction --

             EDWARD
     We’re not going to Forks -- 

             BELLA
     But I have to go home --

             EDWARD
     That’s impossible --

             BELLA
     This is crazy!  If I don’t come 
     home, Charlie will call the FBI.  
     You’ll all have to leave and hide.  
     I won’t let you do that.

             EDWARD
     You can’t go home.  It’s the first place 
     he’ll go.  He’ll track your scent there.

             BELLA
        (horrified)
     What?!  Charlie’s there.  Stop!

She tears at her straps.  Emmett restrains her.  

             BELLA
     He’s in danger because of me!  
     Because of us! 

Edward shakes his head, refusing, but Alice calmly leans forward.

             ALICE
     Turn back, Edward.  It won’t work 
     this way --  


             EDWARD
     I’ll make it work, Alice.  I don’t 
     give a damn what you saw.  

Bella turns to him.  Meeting his eyes.  Intense.

             BELLA
     No, Edward.  You’re going to take 
     me home.  Now.  

Edward can see her determination, see that he will lose this.  
He YELLS in frustration as he angrily WHIPS into a U-TURN in 
a dirt turn out.  Off the DUST FLYING --

INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Charlie watches a baseball game on T.V. as the door suddenly 
BURSTS open to reveal Bella, crying, and Edward, devastated--

             BELLA
     I said, leave me alone!  

             EDWARD
     Bella, don’t do this.  Just think 
     about it, please --

             BELLA
     Get out!  It’s over.

She SLAMS the door.  Charlie has risen, baffled, concerned.

             CHARLIE
     Bella?  What happened?  

             BELLA
     I have to get out of this place.  
     Out of Forks.  I’m leaving.  Now.

Bella runs upstairs.  Charlie hurries after her --

INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Bella slams the door behind her.  REVEAL Edward’s already there, 
pulling things from her drawers and shoving them into a duffle 
faster than humanly possible.  Bella leans against the door.  

             BELLA
        (a pained whisper)
     I can’t lie to him.

Edward gives her a look, you have to.  There’s a KNOCK.

INTERCUT Charlie on the other side.  It’s agony for both of them.

             CHARLIE 
     Bells.  Did he hurt you?

             BELLA
     No, Dad.  

             CHARLIE
     Then what?  Did he break up with you? 

             BELLA
     I broke up with him.  

             CHARLIE
     I thought you liked him?

             BELLA
     That’s why I have to leave.  I don’t 
     want this.  I want to go home.

             EDWARD
        (whispering)
     I’ll be in the truck.

And he disappears out the window.  Bella gathers strength to 
continue her performance.  She opens the door to reveal Charlie.  
He follows as she carries her duffle and truck keys into --

INT. CHARLIE’S HOUSE - BATHROOM (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT

-- where she shoves her toiletries into her bag.

             CHARLIE
     Your mother’s not even in Phoenix. 

             BELLA
     She’ll come home.  I’ll call her 
     from the road.

             CHARLIE
     You can’t drive home now.  I’ll take 
     you to the airport in the morning.

             BELLA
     I want to drive.  I need time to 
     think.  I’ll pull into a motel in a 
     few hours.  I promise.

She heads down the stairs.  Charlie follows... 

INT. CHARLIE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT

Bella reaches the ground floor with Charlie on her heels.  
She’s almost to the door but Charlie blocks her.  


             CHARLIE
     Bells, I know I’m not around much, 
     but I can change that.  We can do 
     more things together.

She takes a breath, hating herself for what she's about to say...

             BELLA
     Like watch more baseball on the flat 
     screen?  Or go to the Coffee Shop?  
     Same people, same top sirloin, same 
     berry cobbler every night?  That’s 
     you, Dad.  Not me.

This hits Charlie hard.  She can barely stand it, heads down 
the stairs, as he takes a second to recover...

EXT. CHARLIE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Bella exits, heads to her truck.  Charlie follows, then 
stands between her and the truck door.   

             CHARLIE
     Bella, no.  I just got you back.

Which breaks Bella’s heart... and forces her to deliver the 
final blow.

             BELLA
     Dad, we tried, but it didn't work.  
     And if I don’t get out now, I’m going 
     get stuck here like mom did.  I won’t 
     make the same mistake.  

Charlie is stunned, wounded.  She takes advantage of his shock, 
pushing past him into her truck.  Fresh tears spring to her eyes.

ANGLE ON THE WOODS 

Trees, branches... and a pair of DEADLY EYES.  James.  He 
watches from a distance as Bella pulls out.  The truck moves 
off... and so does James, leaving Charlie alone with his pain.

INT. BELLA'S TRUCK - NIGHT

Bella drives, wiping tears away.  Edward rises from his 
crouch in the passenger seat.  

             EDWARD
     He’ll forgive you.  

             BELLA
     His face... I said the same words 
     my mother used when she left him.  

             EDWARD
     It was the only way he’d let you go. 
        (gently touches her face)
     I’ll drive.

-- as he takes the wheel and moves Bella out of the driver’s 
seat, gracefully transplanting her.  He FLOORS it.

             EDWARD
     Your father’s safe now, Bella.  The 
     tracker is following us --

Suddenly, BOOM! - a dark figure LEAPS onto the bed of the 
truck.  Bella SCREAMS.  

             EDWARD
     It’s alright.  It’s just Emmett.  
     Alice is in the car behind us.  

She catches her breath.  It kills him to see her so frightened.  
She looks out the window as they drive through town... 

BELLA’S POV - EXT. FORKS/COFFEE SHOP (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT

The small, insulated town passes by in SLOW MOTION... INSIDE THE 
COFFEE SHOP, we SEE Mike, Jessica, Eric and Angela laughing, 
flirting, innocent, hopeful...

EXT. CULLEN HOUSE - NIGHT

Edward, Emmett and Alice rush Bella from the truck to the 
house... but freeze when the door opens and Laurent exits.  They 
immediately take defensive positions but Dr. Cullen appears.

             DR. CULLEN
     He came to warn us.  About James.

They back down slightly.  Laurent address Dr. Cullen.

             LAURENT
     I’ve grown tired of his games.  But 
     the woman, Victoria, will back him.  
     Don’t underestimate her.

Dr. Cullen nods thanks.  Laurent looks at Edward, apologetic. 

             LAURENT
     I’m truly sorry for what’s been 
     unleashed here.

And he moves off, disappearing into the woods...


INT. CULLEN HOUSE - FOUR CAR GARAGE - NIGHT

The side door BURSTS OPEN as Edward and the Cullens enter, 
followed by Bella.  The lights flip on to reveal a pristine 
garage; the Volvo, the red BMW, a black Mercedes sedan, an SUV.  

Everyone but Rosalie springs into action, opening cupboards for 
supplies - cell phones, extra batteries, maps, portable GPS
units, changes of clothes, cans of gasoline, etc.  As they load 
up the vehicles --

             JASPER
     I’ve had to fight our kind before.  
     We’re hard to kill.

Edward pulls several KNIVES from a drawer -- 

             EDWARD
     But not impossible.  We’ll cut him up -- 

             EMMETT
        (with bloodlust)
     Forget knives, we’ll rip him apart 
     with our hands, then burn the pieces --

             DR. CULLEN
     I don’t relish killing another creature.  
     Even a sadistic one like James.

             ROSALIE
     If he doesn’t get to us first.

             BELLA
        (horrified)
     This is insane.  You can’t put yourselves 
     in danger like this - for me.

             ROSALIE
     Too late.

Edward shoots Rosalie a look, but he grabs two sets of keys 
off a hook, throwing one set, lightning fast, to Dr. Cullen --

             EDWARD
     I’ll run Bella south, while you lead 
     the tracker away, then turn on him --

             BELLA
        (stopping him)
     Edward.  You can’t go with me.  My 
     father needs to see your face --


             DR. CULLEN
     She’s right, Edward -- plus the 
     tracker knows you won’t leave her.  
     He’ll follow you first.

Edward agonizes.  Frustrated.  Alice steps forward.

             ALICE
     I’ll go with Bella.  Jasper and I 
     will drive her south.
        (facing him)
     I’ll keep her safe, Edward.

             EDWARD
        (studies her, torn)
     Can you keep your thoughts to yourself?

She nods.  An unspoken agreement.  Edward finally surrenders 
his keys to Alice.  Then he opens one of Bella’s suitcases, 
pulling out clothes, tossing them to --

             EDWARD
     Esme, Rosalie, put these on so the 
     tracker will pick up Bella’s scent.  

             ROSALIE
        (dropping the clothes)
     Why should I?  What is she to me?  Just 
     a danger you’ve inflicted on us --

             DR. CULLEN
        (spinning on her)
     Rosalie.  Bella is with Edward.  She’s 
     a part of this family now.  And we 
     protect our family.  

She glowers, but picks up the clothes.  Dr. Cullen hits the 
door opener and the massive METAL DOORS roll open.  Dr. Cullen 
squeezes Edward’s shoulder before he and Esme climb into the 
SUV. Everyone finishes loading up, climbing in cars --

Amid this, Edward and Bella take a moment together.

             BELLA
     If any of you get hurt because of me --

             EDWARD
     We won’t, there are five of us, two of 
     them.  When it’s done, I’ll come get you. 

He pulls her closer, looking into her eyes. 

             EDWARD
     You're my life now.


They drink each other in, possibly for the last time... as the 
SUV PEELS out, WIPING THE FRAME --

EXT. HIGHWAY, PACIFIC NORTHWEST - DAWN  

The sun begins to rise on the empty road as a sleek, black 
MERCEDES SEDAN with dark tinted windows BLASTS through frame --

INT. MERCEDES - SAME

Jasper drives, Alice in the passenger seat.  Bella is in the 
back, her eyes red from crying.  She talks on her cell phone --

             BELLA
     Mom, it’s me again.  You must have 
     let your phone die.  Anyway, I’m 
     not in Forks anymore but I’m okay.  
     I’ll explain when you call.

She hangs up, then faces back out the window, watching the green, 
misty Olympic Peninsula speed past.  Off Bella’s face --

A SERIES OF DISSOLVES THROUGHOUT THE DAY, THEN THE NIGHT 

-- show us the landscape as it changes from dark green 
forests to stretches of grassy hillsides, to drier, browner 
surroundings, until night falls and headlights lights flash 
by us.  Finally, we land in...

EXT. GAS STATION, MOHAVE DESERT - DAWN  

A bygone station with a shack and a single pump.  It sits on 
the edge of barren sand dunes.  Jasper gasses up the 
Mercedes.  Bella exits the bathroom and approaches.  

             JASPER
     We’ll be in Phoenix soon.

She nods.  Then she sees --

ALICE - standing under the shack’s awning, watching the sun 
rise behind the dunes.  Bella joins her.  SEES a ray of sun 
peak through the awning and hit Alice’s arm, RADIATING it like 
glittering diamonds.  Bella, again, is in awe.  A beat.

             BELLA
     How does someone become like you?

Alice steps deeper under the shade of the awning.

             ALICE
     Edward would be angry if I told you.  

             BELLA
     I didn’t ask him.  I asked my friend.

             ALICE
        (smiles)
     We are friends now, aren’t we?

Alice watches the sand dunes a beat, then...


             ALICE
     When we taste blood, something happens --

             BELLA
     -- A frenzy.  I know.

             ALICE
     So you know when we start, we rarely 
     stop.  

             BELLA
     But if you do?

             ALICE
     There’s venom in our bite.  If we 
     stop, the venom spreads.  It takes a 
     few days for the transformation.  
     Eventually the heart stops and the 
     conversion is complete.  
        (looking at Bella)
     But every moment up till then, 
     you’d be wishing for death. 

Bella takes this in.  Off the rising SUN we --

SMASH TO:

EXT. FOREST, OLYMPIC PENINSULA - DAY

TREES BLOW PAST US at a blinding speed as we track Edward, 
Rosalie, and Emmett who dart in and out of frame, blasting 
through the misty woods, Edward, the fastest, in the lead.

Edward stops, trying to read his enemy's thoughts.  Rosalie 
tears a tiny swatch of her shirt, leaves it on a FLOWERING 
MAPLE TREE.  And then they’re gone.

IN ANOTHER PART OF THE WOODS

James runs with fierce determination.  He stops, catches a 
scent in the air, takes off again...

EXT. LAKE OZETTE - DAY

Esme and Dr. Cullen crouch atop a hill, looking down at the 
lake.  In the distance, below, they SEE --


THEIR POV - ON THE LAKE - VICTORIA jogs into view.  She then 
looks in their direction.  Once Dr. Cullen and Esme are assured  
she has their scent, they continue over the hill’s crest.  

EXT. FOREST, OLYMPIC PENINSULA - DAY

BACK ON EDWARD, Rosalie and Emmett behind him, as they run...

BACK ON JAMES, he blasts past the FLOWERING MAPLE -- then stops, 
backtracks to the tree, finds the tiny swatch of fabric.  He 
starts off again... but stops, smells the fabric.  Something’s 
not right.  Uh oh...

SMASH TO:

INT. HOTEL, PHOENIX - BEDROOM - ON BELLA'S FACE - DAY

Her eyes pop open.  She's lying atop a bed, fully clothed.  
She rises, reorienting.

INT. HOTEL - LIVING ROOM - DAY

The blinds are pulled.  Alice and Jasper stare blankly at a 
T.V. set. Several plates of food crowd a table.  Alice looks 
up as Bella enters, looking at her cell phone.  

             BELLA
     I wish he’d call.

             ALICE
     You should eat.

But Bella ignores the food.  She sits heavily.

             BELLA
     They could get hurt.  It’s not 
     worth it.

             JASPER
        (insistent)
     Yes.  It is.  

She’s taken aback.  It’s the first time he’s engaged with her.  

             JASPER
     Edward’s changed since he found 
     you.  And none of us want to look 
     into his eyes for the next hundred 
     years if he loses you.  
        (he looks forward again)
     It’s worth it.  

Suddenly, Alice REELS.  Jasper goes to her, Bella follows.


             JASPER
     What do you see?

             ALICE
        (with deep worry)
     The tracker.  He just changed course...

Jasper quickly sets a pad of paper and pencil in front of her.  

             JASPER
     Where will it take him, Alice?

PUSH IN ON ALICE’S FACE as we--

FLASH POP TO - JAMES

A disorienting vision of him standing in a room full of...

             ALICE
     Mirrors.  It’s a room of mirrors.

Alice begins to draw at HYPER SPEED, closing her eyes, trying 
to see it clearly.

             BELLA
     How do the visions work?  Edward 
     said they weren't always certain. 

             JASPER
     She sees the course people are on, 
     while they're on it.  If they change 
     their minds, the visions change.  

Bella looks over Alice’s shoulder to see the drawing.  

             BELLA
     So the course James is on now will 
     lead him to... a ballet studio?

             ALICE
        (looks up at her)
     You’ve been here?

             BELLA
     No.  I don’t know.  I used to take 
     ballet lessons as a kid.  The 
     school looked like that.  But I’m 
     sure they all do.

             JASPER
     Was your school here in Phoenix?  

             BELLA
     Around the corner from my house.  But I 
     haven’t been there in ten years.


             JASPER
     Do you have any reason to go now?

             BELLA
     No.  God, no.  I hated the place.

Alice and Jasper share a look, trying to figure this out.  
Suddenly, Bella JUMPS as her cell phone RINGS.  She picks it 
up.  Sees the caller I.D. and exhales relief.  She answers...

             BELLA
     Edward.  Are you alright?

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. JEEP/EXT. OUTSIDE THE SEATTLE AIRPORT - DAY

Dr. Cullen drives the Jeep, fast, Emmett in the back, Edward in 
the passenger seat on his cell phone.  

             EDWARD
     I’m coming to get you.  
        (hates having to say this)
     We lost the tracker.  The woman is 
     still in the area.  Rosalie and 
     Esme are protecting your father.

             BELLA
        (sinking)
     This is my fault.  You warned me, 
     but I didn’t think.  I just...

             EDWARD
     Bella, we’re in love.  We can’t 
     change that.  

             BELLA
     No... we can’t.
        (then)
     When will you get here?

             EDWARD
     In a couple hours.  You’ll meet us at 
     the airport.  Then you and I will fly 
     somewhere.  Together.  The others 
     will keep hunting.
        (then, determined)
     Bella, I swear to you, I’ll do whatever 
     it takes to make you safe again.  

Off Bella, her eyes welling...


EXT. HOTEL - DAY

SEE Alice in the lobby, settling the bill.  Jasper loads up 
the car out front.  

INT. HOTEL - BEDROOM - DAY

Bella gathers her things, then her phone RINGS again. 

INSERT CALLER I.D. - It reads “HOME.”  Bella answers --

             BELLA
     Mom, I’m so glad you got my --  

             RENE 
        (panicked)
     Bella?  Bella?  You scared me, 
     don't ever do that to me again.  

             BELLA
     Calm down, Mom.  Everything is fine, 
     okay?  I’ll explain every --

HEAR RUSTLING on the line, as if Rene dropped the phone.

             BELLA
     ... Mom?  Are you there?

Then Bella HEARS a voice that sends a chill down her spine --

             JAMES 
     Nice house you have here.  Not the 
     best on the block, but comfortable.  

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. RENE’S HOUSE, PHOENIX - DAY

VERY CLOSE ON JAMES, his sinister eyes and vicious smile.

             JAMES
     I was prepared to wait for you.  But 
     then Mom came home after she received 
     a very worried call from your Dad.  
     It all worked out quite well.

Bella, breath short, eyes wild with fear, looks out the 
window at the unaware Alice and Jasper.  

             JAMES
     I must say, Forks High School doesn’t 
     protect its students’ privacy very 
     well.  It was just too easy for 
     Victoria to find your previous address. 


             RENE 
     Bella?  Bella?...

             BELLA
     Please, leave my mother out of it.

             JAMES
     You’re protective of her.  That’s 
     nice.  You can still save her.  But 
     you’ll need to get away from your 
     friends.  Can you do that?  

             BELLA
     I... don’t think so.

             JAMES
     If your mother’s life depends on it? 

Bella is terrified, but there’s no choice here.  

             BELLA
     Where should I meet you?

James grins as he fingers a PHOTO of Bella that’s attached to 
the refrigerator with a magnet.  It’s the same photo Charlie 
has of her, age 7, in a tutu, sitting on the floor.  

             JAMES
     I’ll be in touch.  And I’ll know if 
     you bring anyone along.  Poor mommy 
     would pay the price for that mistake.
        (sniffs the air)
     She smells like you.  Delicious.

STAY ON BELLA as she hangs up, panicked.  She starts flinging 
open drawers, searching for a weapon - a pen, a sewing kit.  
Useless.  Then she remembers...

Her purse.  She dumps out the contents, and FINDS the knife 
Charlie gave her.  She clings to it, her only protection now.

INT. PHOENIX AIRPORT - AFTERNOON

Alice and Jasper flank Bella as they make their way through 
the airport.  Jasper carries Bella’s duffle. 

INT. AIRPORT - COUNTER - LATE AFTERNOON

Alice talks intently with an AIRLINE SALESWOMAN as Jasper and 
Bella wait nearby.

             AIRLINE SALESWOMAN
     Sorry, no flights to Calgary either.  
     Maybe in the morning --


             ALICE
     My brother and his wife want to 
     begin their honeymoon tonight.  

             AIRLINE SALESWOMAN
     Wouldn’t they prefer a warmer spot?

             ALICE
     Sun allergies.  What about Greenland? 

ON BELLA AND JASPER

Bella eyes a clock on the wall.  It’s time to make her move. 

             BELLA
     Edward’s flight is landing soon.  I 
     should grab something to eat while I can.

             JASPER
     I’ll go with you.

             BELLA
     It’s okay.  The stand is just over --

But he’s not listening.  He drops Bella’s duffle next to Alice 
and gestures - we’ll be right back.  Alice nods... 

Then Alice stops, her brow furrowing.  Is it another vision?  
Off Alice, concerned as she watches Bella go off with Jasper.

INT. AIRPORT - LATE AFTERNOON

Jasper, ever vigilant, escorts Bella through the airport.  
Bella then sees the restroom.  An idea occurring.  

             BELLA
     I’m just going to run to the restroom.

             JASPER
     I’ll wait outside.

As Jasper takes up a post outside the restroom entrance --

INT. AIRPORT - RESTROOM (CONTINUOUS) - LATE AFTERNOON

Bella enters... then BOLTS to the other side of the facility 
where there’s another exit.  She dashes out --

INT. AIRPORT - LATE AFTERNOON

Bella makes a wild run through the crowds and out to --

EXT. AIRPORT (CONTINUOUS) - LATE AFTERNOON

-- Bella bursts out the door.  Sees a line of taxis --


INT. TAXI (CONTINUOUS) - LATE AFTERNOON

-- Bella jumps in, closes the door.  The DRIVER is a small, 
elderly woman with a smoker’s hacking COUGH.  

             BELLA
        (taking a breath for courage)
     Scottsdale, please.

The taxi pulls out.  Bella watches the airport disappear.  
Off her FACE IN THE REAR WINDOW...

             BELLA 
     I’ve never given much thought to 
     how I would die...

BELLA’S POV - EXT. SCOTTSDALE - NIGHT

Once again, we see the polished malls, the manicured cactus 
gardens.  All empty for the night.  

             BELLA 
     But dying in the place of someone I 
     love seems like a good way to go...    

EXT. MIMI’S SCHOOL OF DANCE - NIGHT

The taxi makes its way down a deserted street and comes to a 
stop in front of the isolated building.  

INT. TAXI - SAME

Bella looks out the window with trepidation.

             ELDERLY DRIVER
     You want me to wait, honey?  Place 
     looks deserted.

But she launches into a sea lion’s COUGH.  She’ll be no help.

             BELLA
     You should go.

Bella hands her some cash, then sees her cigarettes and 
lighter lying on the seat beside her.  

             BELLA
     But how much for that lighter?

EXT. MIMI’S SCHOOL OF DANCE - NIGHT

The taxi pulls away leaving Bella on the curb facing the 
building.  The lighter is in one hand, the knife in the other.


             BELLA 
     I can’t bring myself to regret the 
     decisions that brought me face to 
     face with death... they also 
     brought me to Edward.

She puts the lighter in her pants pocket.  The knife in her 
breast pocket.  She wraps her purse strap around her wrist.

             BELLA 
     But my decisions now will determine 
     whether or not I see him again.  

She takes a breath, approaches the school.  Peers in the windows.  
The blinds are drawn.  But from inside, we HEAR a faint sound...

             RENE 
     Bella?  Bella?

It’s time.  Bella goes to the front door.  It’s unlocked. 

INT. MIMI’S SCHOOL OF DANCE - LOBBY - NIGHT

Bella enters.  She hugs the ornate, panelled walls as she 
makes her way down the hall, each step taking every ounce of 
her courage.  Up ahead, she sees LIGHT coming from the main 
studio.  She moves toward it. 

INT. MIMI’S SCHOOL OF DANCE - STUDIO - NIGHT

Bella cautiously enters this grand, empty room of mirrors.  A 
ballet bar wraps around the walls --  

             RENE 
     Bella, you scared me.  Don’t you 
     ever do that to me again.  

Bella whirls, trying to find its source.  She follows the sound 
to a cleaning supply CLOSET.  She throws open the door to FIND --

A T.V. - ON SCREEN A VIDEO PLAYS - Bella, age 7, hides in the 
very closet the T.V. is in now.  Little Bella looks up at us.  

             RENE 
     Don’t you want to dance, baby?  

Little Bella shakes her head stubbornly.  The frame jiggles 
as Rene hands someone the camera.  Rene, ten years younger, 
appears on screen and kneels next to Bella.

             BELLA
     Everyone makes fun of me.

             RENE
     But you’re a wonderful dancer.


             BELLA
     Mom, I suck. 

LAUGHTER behind Bella.  She spins to find James up on the 
second floor a balcony.  He flips on some stage lights -- 
they practically blind her.  

             JAMES
     That’s my favorite part.  Feisty 
     child, weren’t you?

Bella's face flushes with rage... and relief.  

             BELLA
     She’s not here.

             JAMES
     Sorry.  But you really made it too easy.

He sighs, disappointed.  He drops down to the floor beside 
her, then points a VIDEO CAMERA at Bella. 

             JAMES
     So to make things more entertaining, 
     I’m going to make a little film of our 
     time together.  Borrowed this from 
     your house.  Hope you don’t mind.  
        (turns it on)
     And... action!

Bella FLINGS her purse at him, and runs for the door.

             JAMES
     Excellent!  An escape attempt.

Suddenly, he’s right behind her.  She freezes.  

             JAMES
     It’ll break Edward’s little heart.

He smells her hair.  Touches her throat. 

             BELLA
     Edward has nothing to do with this.

             JAMES
     He will.  His rage will make for 
     more interesting sport than you 
     proved to be.

He’s having too much fun to notice -- the knife in her hand.    
She closes her eyes and blindly THRUSTS the knife over her 
shoulder as hard as she can!  She stabs him in the eye.  


Then she runs, as James REELS back briefly, tossing away the 
knife.  But he’s on her in a flash and suddenly --

She’s FLYING BACKWARD across the room!  Time speeds up, slows 
down, fracturing the moment as she’s suspended in mid-air... 

Then she CRASHES into the mirror which SHATTERS in a shower 
of glass, thousands of tiny shards reflecting light in all 
directions.  James captures it on film. 

             JAMES
     Beautiful!  Very visually dynamic.  
     I chose my stage well.

Now he stands over her, his eye a gash, but he pays it no 
mind.  He films her as she CRAWLS along the wall to the 
cleaning supply closet.  She crawls inside...

             JAMES
     Still feisty, aren’t you?  

Her back to him, Bella fumbles for a bottle of Orange Glo 
Wood Cleaner and a rag.  He doesn’t see her stuff the rag 
into the bottle as --  

             JAMES
     Is that what makes you special?  
     Because frankly, I don’t see it.  What 
     could be so unique, that Edward denies 
     himself that scent, that taste?

He inhales as if he can taste her already -- as she pulls out 
the lighter.  Ignites the rag --

Suddenly, a FIREBALL flies at James -- he SWATS it to the 
other side of the room where it explodes against a rack of 
ballroom dancing DRESSES, igniting a fire. 

             JAMES
     Fire!  Well done.  But I’m afraid 
     you have to dismember me first.  Or 
     didn't they tell you that part? 

James GRABS Bella’s foot, dragging her out of the closet.  

             JAMES
     Too bad he didn’t have the strength 
     to turn you.  Instead, he kept you 
     this fragile little human.  It's 
     cruel, really.  

Then he STOMPS on her shin!  HEAR her tibia SNAP!  Blood 
SPRAYS.  Bella SCREAMS in agony. 


             JAMES
     Tell Edward how much it hurts. 

Abruptly, the camera is in her face --

             JAMES
     Tell him to avenge you.

             BELLA
     No!  Edward, don't... 

James inhales as her blood pools.  He leans in, hungry.  Bella, 
half-conscious, watches him turn the camera on his own face --

VIDEO CAMERA’S POV - ECU ON JAMES’ FACE

             JAMES
     Cut!  The end.

Suddenly -- JAMES IS KNOCKED OUT OF FRAME!  

He immediately rises to find himself face to face with an 
enraged Edward.  James grins as they circle each other.

             JAMES
     You’re alone...
        (realizing)
     ... because you’re faster than the 
     others.  But not stronger.

             EDWARD
     Strong enough to kill you.

And they LUNGE at each other in a THUNDEROUS collision!  A 
fierce fight erupts with the FIRE slowly spreading behind them.  

BELLA'S POV - AS IF UNDERWATER  

From her view, the fight is DREAMLIKE, slow motion, balletic.  
Dark figures hurling through shafts of light, moving in and 
out of focus.  

ALTERNATE BETWEEN BELLA’S POV AND THE EXPLOSIVE RAW REALITY -- 

-- Edward and James SMASH each other into walls.
-- LEAP across the room at each other.
-- Throw each other UP against the ceiling, punching a HOLE 
clear through the roof.  
-- DEBRIS rains down as part of the ceiling collapses.  
-- THEY FLING each other into one mirror after another, five 
in a row, a domino effect of SHATTERING GLASS.

THE FLAMES grow, and with a final push, James THROWS Edward 
across the room.  Edward immediately rights himself, but in 
that split second --


James now crouches beside Bella.  He grabs her HAND --

Looking directly at Edward with a sinister grin -- he SINKS 
HIS TEETH into Bella’s hand!  Bella SCREAMS in agony.  

Edward's rage ERUPTS and he dives onto James, delivering a 
series of deadly BLOWS that finally take James down.  He’s 
crouched over James in an animalistic fury as -

Dr. Cullen suddenly drops down from the hole in the ceiling.  
Dr. Cullen rushes to the injured Bella who SCREAMS again in 
pain.  Edward looks up at her, then dashes to her --

James starts to rise, but EMMETT drops down directly on top 
of him, replacing Edward.  Jasper and Alice drop down, too, 
and surround James, crouching into attack mode.  Then the 
three of them LUNGE on James like a feral pack of animals --

BELLA’S POV - ON THEIR THREE FIGURES, going in and out of 
focus... it almost looks like a tribal dance around a funeral 
pyre as they rip James apart, throwing limbs into the fire... 

BACK ON BELLA -- as Edward reaches her side.  Dr. Cullen works 
fast to assess her wounds, focusing on a massive bleed from her 
leg.  But clearly her hand hurts the most.  She writhes in pain.  

INTERCUT BELLA’S DISORIENTED POV WITH THE CHAOTIC REALITY: 

Dr. Cullen applies pressure to the gash on her thigh -- 

             DR. CULLEN
     Her femoral artery’s been severed.  
     She’s losing too much blood --

             BELLA
     It’s on fire!  My hand!

             EDWARD
        (to Dr. Cullen)
     Venom --  

             BELLA
     Edward, it burns!

             EDWARD
     I know.  I’m here.
        (to Dr. Cullen)
     It’s spreading.

Dr. Cullen never stops his ministrations as --

             DR. CULLEN
     You have to make a choice.  Either 
     let the change happen --

             EDWARD
     No!

BELLA’S POV - ALICE appears behind Edward, fuzzy, indistinct.  


             ALICE
     It’s going to happen.  I’ve seen it --

             EDWARD
     Your vision was wrong!

             DR. CULLEN
     Alice, find me a tourniquet.  A 
     rag, a shirt.

Alice rips the sleeve off her blouse and kneels to aid Dr. 
Cullen with Bella’s wounds.

             BELLA
     It’s burning!

             EDWARD
     What’s the other choice?  You said --

             DR. CULLEN
        (to Alice)
     Tighter, above the knee --

             EDWARD
     Carlisle.

             DR. CULLEN
        (looking up)
     You can try to suck the venom out.  

             EDWARD
     I -- won’t be able to stop --

             DR. CULLEN
     Find the will to stop.  But choose, 
     she only has minutes left.

Dr. Cullen returns to his triage with Alice as Edward looks 
down at Bella.  She thrashes in pain.  Finally, Edward takes 
her hand.  She tries to pull it away.

             EDWARD
     It’s alright, Bella.  I’ll make it 
     go away. 

He looks at her - then starts to suck the venom from her 
hand.  They never take their eyes off one another, the 
connection palpable, intense...  

CLOSE ON BELLA’S EYES - wild with pain.  But subsiding... 


CLOSE ON EDWARD’S EYES - the frenzy has begun.  His VEINS 
pulse, his eyes start to turn BURGUNDY.  He sucks harder.  
Hungrily.  Tears fall from Edward’s eyes.  He wants to stop 
but can’t.  Dr. Cullen’s voice sounds miles away...

             DR. CULLEN
     Stop!  Her blood is clean, you’re 
     killing her!

-- but the bloodlust is too strong.  He is killing her.  Bella 
looks at him, forgivingly, as she begins to lose consciousness... 

BELLA’S POV - ON EDWARD - growing blurry.  It’s as if she’s 
underwater, like her dreams, and he’s above water, the white 
sun behind him blinding her until he disappears, and we...

FADE TO WHITE:

OVER WHITE:

             BELLA 
     Death is peaceful.  Easy.

BELLA’S FACE APPEARS IN THE WHITENESS

Eyes closed.  But they slowly open.  She squints at the light.  

             BELLA 
     Life... is harder... 

An oxygen tube rests under her nose.  She reaches for it, 
confused.  A hand stops her as her surroundings come into focus.

             RENE 
     Leave it alone, Baby. 

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Bella lies in a hospital bed.  Bandaged, leg in a cast.  In bad 
shape.  Rene hovers over her, tears in her eyes.  On the dresser, 
SEE get well cards and a PHOTO MONTAGE of her friends from Forks.

             BELLA
     Edward?  Where’s --

             RENE
     He’s asleep.

She nods across the room to a chair in which Edward “sleeps.”

             RENE
     He never leaves.  And your dad’s 
     down in the cafeteria. 


             BELLA
     What... happened?

             RENE
     Baby, you fell down two flights of 
     stairs and through a window.  

Bella is drawing a blank, confused.  Rene jogs her memory --

             RENE
     Edward came here to convince you to 
     come back to Forks.  His father 
     brought him down.  You went to their 
     hotel but you tripped on the stairs.  

A moment... then Bella realizes it’s a cover story.  She nods.

             BELLA
     Sounds like me.

Rene’s cell phone BEEPS.  She opens it.  Reads a text, starts 
typing in a reply.

             RENE
     It’s Phil.  He’s worried about you.

             BELLA
     Mom, you’re... texting.

             RENE
     I actually read the instruction 
     manual.  I told him to stay in 
     Florida.  The Suns signed him!  

             BELLA
     That’s great mom.  

             RENE
     You’re gonna love Jacksonville.  
     It’s always sunny and you’ll have 
     your own bathroom...

             BELLA
     Mom, wait.  I want to live in 
     Forks.  I have Dad... 
        (re: the get well cards)
     ... and friends...

             RENE
        (re: Edward)
     And he’s there. 

Bella shrugs, conceding the truth.



             RENE
     Charlie doesn’t like him.  Blames 
     him for your leaving.  

             BELLA
     What do you think?

             RENE
        (lowering her voice)
     I think that boy is in love with you.

Bella smiles.  Rene grins.  Bella glances at Edward.

             BELLA
     Um, Mom, would you mind getting Dad?  I 
     want to talk to him.  Apologize.

             RENE
     I’m sure he doesn’t care about 
     that, Baby.  But I‘ll go get him.

Rene kisses Bella’s forehead.  Exits.  Bella watches her go.  
The door shutting behind her.  Bella turns back to find 
Edward standing next to her with deep concern.  Her eyes 
well.  He kisses her forehead soothingly. 

             BELLA
     Is James - did you -- ?

             EDWARD
     We took care of him.  And the 
     woman, Victoria, she ran off.

She closes her eyes with relief, then looks at him.  

             BELLA
     I’m alive because of you.

             EDWARD
        (darkens)
     You’re in here because of me.  

Her wounds cause him pain.  He strokes her face.

             EDWARD
     The worst of it... was thinking I 
     couldn’t stop --

             BELLA
     But you did.  

             EDWARD
     Bella, you should go to Jacksonville.  
     Where I can’t hurt you anymore...


             BELLA
     What?  No!  I want to be with you!  I 
     don’t want --

             EDWARD
        (sitting next to her)
     Sssh.  It’s alright.  I’m not going 
     anywhere.  I’m right here...

He wraps an arm around her, reassuring.  As she curls up in 
his arms... 

                              DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. FORKS, WASHINGTON - TWILIGHT

An AERIAL SWEEP over the lush green forests.  We’re back in 
the misty, damp beauty of the Pacific Northwest...

INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Edward and Charlie sit across from one another.  Silent.  Edward 
is dressed in an elegant suit.  But even calm Edward is unnerved 
by Charlie’s glare.  They hear footsteps and rise as --

BELLA -- appears at the top of the stairs in a stunning long 
dress.  Edward is enchanted.  Bella descends with difficulty, 
due to her LEG CAST.  Charlie edges out Edward to help her down.  

             BELLA
     Alice lent me the dress.  It was the 
     only thing that would fit over my 
     cast.  Is it too... ?

             EDWARD
     You’re perfect.

             BELLA
     It would help if you told me where this 
     “special” place was you’re taking me. 

             EDWARD
     That would ruin the surprise. 

             CHARLIE
     Maybe you’re not up for it, Bells.

             BELLA
     No, it’ll be nice to get out.

             EDWARD
     I’ll take good care of her. 

             CHARLIE
     Heard that before. 

Edward moves to open the door.  Charlie holds Bella back.


             CHARLIE
        (sotto)
     I put some pepper spray in your bag.

             BELLA
     Dad.

             CHARLIE
     ... and... you look beautiful.

Father and daughter share a smile...

EXT. MANSION, MILLER TREE INN - NIGHT 

Edward’s Volvo pulls up to this lovely inn.  He helps Bella 
out of the car, and begins to guide her to the rear of the 
mansion.  HEAR music coming from somewhere.  She’s confused. 

             BELLA
     Are we having dinner here or 
     something?  

He just grins.  Edward guides her around a corner to...

EXT. MANSION BACKYARD (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT

THE PROM - tented in a Monte Carlo theme.  Gaming tables, 
roulette wheels, slot machines.  Guys in tuxedos and girls in 
gowns gamble for prizes, dance and socialize.  A D.J. spins
tunes.  Mr. Molina and other CHAPERONES mingle with the crowd.  

             BELLA
     The prom?  You really are trying to 
     kill me.

             EDWARD
        (sincerely)
     It’s an important rite of passage.  
     I don’t want you to miss anything.  

She can’t be mad at him, just shakes her head affectionately.  
They continue into the prom.  Several heads turn.  Bella sees --

THE DANCE FLOOR 

-- a gap has formed.  In the middle, two couples whirl 
gracefully.  It's Alice and Jasper, Rosalie and Emmett, 
looking absolutely stunning.  Everyone gives them plenty of 
room, not wanting to stand in contrast to such radiance. 

Rosalie glances over; indifference has replaced fury.  But 
Alice waves brightly.  Bella returns it with a smile.  A 
FLASHBULB gets her attention --



BELLA’S POV - PHOTOGRAPHER’S STATION

Eric and Angela pose in front of BACKDROP of Monte Carlo’s 
Grand Casino.  Eric makes a James Bond face.  Angela gives 
Bella a look that says, he’s a spazz but cute.  Bella laughs.

As Bella and Edward pass a black jack table --

             MIKE 
     Ante up, Arizona.

Bella turns to find a tuxedo’d Mike with Jessica, playing a 
hand.  Jessica jumps up, delighted, and gives Bella a hug.  

             BELLA
     You look great, Jess.  The halter.

             JESSICA
     I know, huh?

Mike give Edward a perfunctory nod.  The tension still thick.

             MIKE
	Cullen.
        
	       EDWARD
      Newton.

             JESSICA
        (to Edward, a little gaga)
     Hi Edward, you look... good.

             MIKE
     Let’s dance.  

Mike wraps a possessive arm around Jessica and quickly guides 
her to the dance floor.  Edward smirks, then turns to Bella --  

             EDWARD
     Shall we? 

             BELLA
        (laughs, then realizes)
     You’re serious.

He doesn’t wait for an answer, more or less CARRIES her to --

THE DANCE FLOOR -- then places her feet atop his own... and 
starts to move.  She actually begins to enjoy it.

             EDWARD
     See?  You’re dancing.

             BELLA
     At prom.

As they dance, she feels his grace, his strength.  Becomes 
thoughtful.  Finally, she looks at him...


             BELLA
     Edward... I need to ask you... why 
     did you save me?
        (off his questioning look)
     If you’d let the venom spread, I 
     could’ve been like you by now.

             EDWARD
        (stops, horrified)
     You don’t know what you’re asking.  
     You don’t want this.

             BELLA
     I want you.  Always.

             EDWARD
        (angry)
     I won’t end your life for you.  

He keeps dancing, slowly, hoping his was the last word.

             BELLA
     I’m dying anyway.  Every minute, I 
     get closer, older --

             EDWARD
     That’s how it’s supposed to happen.  

             BELLA
     Not the way Alice saw it.  
        (off his sharp look)
     I heard her.  She saw me like you. 

             EDWARD
     Her visions change, Bella.  

             BELLA
     Based on what someone decides.  And 
     I’ve decided. 

He looks at her, angry.  

             EDWARD
     Is that what you dream about?  
     Becoming a monster?  

             BELLA
     I dream about being with you forever.  

             EDWARD
        (intense)
     You really want this?

             BELLA
     Yes.

He lowers his lips to her neck.  One bite is all it would take.  


             EDWARD
     You’re ready right now?

             BELLA
        (breathless)
     Yes.

His lips hover over her skin, a long beat... then he presses his 
lips to her throat.  Not a bite.  A kiss.  He looks at her.

             EDWARD
     You’re going to have a long and happy 
     life with me.  Isn’t that enough?

She looks at him... and finally smiles.

             BELLA
     For now.

They WHIRL around, gliding on his grace, never looking away from 
one another, as we CRANE UP on them, in each other’s arms... 

             BELLA 
     No one will surrender tonight.  But I 
     won't give in.  I know what I want.

CONTINUE UP AND BACK on the mansion, its lights twinkling, 
getting smaller, SEE the dark forest surrounding it... until 
we’re well above the prom, and we realize --  

UNKNOWN POV - ON THE MANSION 

... someone’s watching it, looking down from atop a mountain, 
the MUSIC wafting up in echoes.  We WHIP REVERSE to REVEAL...

VICTORIA!  Seething, a low, sinister SNARL in the back of her 
throat.  PUSH IN FAST ON HER FACE, AND INTO HER BURGUNDY EYES 
filled with vengeance as we --

THE END

SMASH TO BLACK.
