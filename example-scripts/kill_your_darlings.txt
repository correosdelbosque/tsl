EXT. RIVERSIDE PARK - NIGHT
Underwater. 

Shafts of eroded light slice into the depths of the Hudson 
River. The ghostly melody of Lili Marlene, the ache of the 
war-time lover, plays as a strange SHADOW drifts into view.

We realize it is a BODY.

             ALLEN
	(V.O.)
      Some things, once youve loved 
      them, become yours forever.

The body BREAKS the surface and we see the face of its owner 
 DAVID KAMMERER, 33, bearded, handsome. He is clothed, open 
white shirt, khakis. Dead. 

             ALLEN
	(V.O.)
      And if you try to let them go...

Suddenly, a breath: he comes back to life. 

David floats back to LUCIEN CARR, 20, (blonde, beautiful, 
shirtless and terrified), waist deep in the water. 

The scene is playing in REVERSE MOTION.

             ALLEN
	(V.O.)
      They only circle back and return to 
      you.

Davids body LIFTS into the young man's arms. We see Davids 
feet and hands are TIED together with shoelaces. Stones rise 
back into his pockets. 

             ALLEN
	(V.O.)
      They become part of who you are... 

A stain of blood on Davids chest shrinks, vanishes. 

Davids eyes OPEN.

                                  CUT TO:

INT. THE TOMBS - DAY

             LUCIEN
      ...or they destroy you.

From behind the bars of a jail cell, Lucien Carr (the young 
man from the opening) finishes reading from a paper 
MANUSCRIPT in his hand. 


                                      2.
Lucien, furious, crumples it up.

             LUCIEN
      You cant show this to anyone.

We PULL BACK to reveal the author of the manuscript: a 
eighteen-year-old ALLEN GINSBERG. Unslept and exhausted. But 
determined.

Allen stares defiantly at Lucien from the other side of the 
bars.

             ALLEN
      Then tell the truth, Lu.

             LUCIEN
      You werent even there. Its your 
      truth. Its fiction.

Allen grabs for his manuscript back, but Lucien pulls it out 
of reach.

             LUCIEN
      You wanted him gone too. You sent 
      him to me.

Allen reaches through the bars and SNATCHES the paper.

Lucien wont let go -- its a tug of war between the two 
boys, two wills. Allen yanks the paper from Luciens grip and 
wins. Lucien, panicking.

             LUCIEN
	(CONTD)
      Please. You'll kill me with that.

Allen turns and races towards the exit of the prison. 
Desperate, Lucien calls out after him.

             LUCIEN
      Allen! No! 

Allen doesnt turn. An alarm HAMMERS through the prison.

             LUCIEN
      Allen!  No!  DONT...!

CUT TO BLACK.

                                  CUT TO:


EXT. GINSBERG HOME - NIGHT
SUPER: PATERSON, NEW JERSEY. 1943. ONE YEAR EARLIER.

Over a strip of working-class row homes, we hear the sounds 
of a radio announcer giving a dispatch from the war front. 

                                      3.

             RADIO ANNOUNCER
	(V.O.)
      American daylight bombers were busy 
      again, as our liberators with 
      fighter escort continue the air 
      offensive with another sock at 
      German coastal installations in 
      France.

INT. GINSBERG HOME - NIGHT

The radio continues playing to a modest home. We see a young 
man cleaning house, sweeping in the background.

             RADIO ANNOUNCER
	(V.O.)
      But the Germans report a big new 
      red army push toward Romania. This 
      is World War news.

As the war report ends, a stuffy musical piece begins. We 
hear a groan from the young man. 

From out of the background emerges Allen Ginsberg (now 17, 
fresh-faced, horn-rimmed glasses, dutiful son). The kind of 
kid who takes care of everything.

He storms up to the radio, switches the station to a fast-
paced boogie-woogie number. He smiles and dances joyfully to 
the up-beat number with his broom.

The door slams. Allen looks up, caught in the act, to see his 
father LOUIS (40's, school teacher, Jewish working-class 
poet) home from work. Allen accidentally drops the broom.

             LOUIS
      How was she today?

Louis turns off the music. The playful mood dies. Allen spots 
the mail in his fathers hand. 

             ALLEN
      Fine. Anything for me?

             LOUIS
      Why? You expecting something?

Allen looks down, a bad liar.


                                      4.
             ALLEN
      No.

Suddenly, from upstairs, the sound of glass shattering. Then 
a woman whimpering in pain. Allen, worried, looks off, dread 
in his face. His father just sighs.

             LOUIS
      I told you it wouldnt work.

Allen rushes upstairs.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM, GINSBERG HOME - NIGHT

Allen runs into a dark room, flips on the light.

             ALLEN
      Mom?

His mother NAOMI (early 40's, Jewish, deep personality 
disorder) squats in the corner of the room, in a dirty 
bathrobe. Her knuckles are bleeding.

             NAOMI
      Youve got to get me out of here. 
      He nailed the windows shut while I 
      was in the bath.

She motions to the shattered window pane across the room. 
Allen sees her blood on the sill, where she tried to escape.      
He moves towards her, to console her. What hes good at. 

             ALLEN
      Dad didnt do that. I nailed the 
      windows. Because youre not right.

Naomi, in the midst of a paranoid attack, puts her finger to 
her mouth.

             NAOMI
      Shhh...Allen. He can hear you!

Allen wraps his mothers hand with a dish towel.

             ALLEN
      You have to rest. Clear your head. 
      Do you want to go back to 
      Greystone?

             NAOMI
      He wouldnt dare put me back there.


                                      5.
             ALLEN
      Then listen to me.

             NAOMI
      SHHHH. He can hear you!

Shes losing it. Allen quickly thinks, turns to her bureau. 
He pulls out a RECORD, starts the phonograph and turns up the 
volume. 

             ALLEN
      Can he still hear me?

A BRAHMS WALTZ plays. 

             NAOMI
      What did you say?

Allen turns the music up all the way. Allen mimes deafness. 
Finally, she understands: their sounds are drowned out by the 
music. 

Allen reaches for her. She finally softens, takes his hand.

As mother and son waltz together with the music, Naomi 
clutches Allen to her, like hes the only thing keeping her 
sane. Because he is.

             NAOMI
      Dont ever leave me. 

Allen, trapped, over her shoulder. 

From the doorway, we see that Louis has been watching the 
whole time.

EXT. GINSBERG FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

Overwhelmed, Allen shakes on the front stairs. Shes not 
well. The faint sound of jazz, fun from someone elses home 
from down the block. Louis comes out onto the porch, with an 
open LETTER in hand from the mail pile. Hes upset.

             LOUIS
      Were you even going to tell me you 
      applied?!

Allen spies the Columbia University seal on the front. Hes 
been caught. He looks down, ashamed.


                                      6.
             ALLEN
      I didnt want her to know.
        (beat)
      It was a dream anyway. 

Louis lights his own cigarette. Offers his son one. He 
declines.

             LOUIS
        (talking to himself, 
         dreaming)
      Trillings there. Van Doren. 
      English Professors. Important 
      fellows. And New York City, right 
      in your goddamn lap.

Louis sits beside his son. 

             LOUIS
      Love that is hoarded, 
      molds at last. 

Allen, surprised to hear his Dad reciting one of his poems.

             LOUIS
      Until we know, 
      the only thing we have--

             ALLEN
      is what we give away.

             LOUIS
      Is what we hand away. Have, hand. 
      Consonance. 

             ALLEN
      Give, is. Assonance.

             LOUIS
      I wrote the goddamn poem. Go write 
      your own. 

Louis hands over the letter. The hardest thing hes ever 
done. 

Allen takes the envelope, rips it open. Hes looking at the 
response in shock. Louis tries to read his sons face.

             ALLEN
      I got in.

             LOUIS
      You got in?!


             ALLEN      I got into Columbia University! 

             LOUIS
      You got into Columbia University?!

Allen and his father embrace.

                                      7.

                                  CUT TO:

EXT. COLUMBIA QUAD - DAY

First day of college. Allen crosses the grand Ivy League 
campus in awe. Before him, the staggering facade of the 
library like the Parthenon. A troop of Navy midshipmen pass 
by. Wartime is on.

INT. ALLEN'S DORM ROOM - DAY

Allen sets his bag on his bed. He notices on one wall are 
patriotic posters, exercise posters. Hes already got a 
roommate.

He eyes a map of the New York City subway system. He cant 
believe hes really here in the big city. He walks over to 
it.

Allen studies the map, his finger gliding down to Greenwich 
Village.

             LUKE
	(O.S.)
      You dont wanna go down there.

His roommate LUKE, 18, buzz cut, in a sweaty Columbia 
sweatshirt, leans over him. 

             LUKE
      Land of the fairies. Head there and 
      you never come back.
        (extending a firm hand)
      Luke Detweiler, Danville, Virginia. 

             ALLEN
      Allen Ginsberg. 

             LUKE
        (bright smile)
      Youre Jewish, right?

Allen nods. Luke smacks him on the shoulder.


                                      8.
             LUKE
      Im getting good at telling. 

INT. LIBRARY, MAIN HALL - DAY

The beautiful main hall of Columbia Universitys Butler 
Library. Its Ivy League tradition meets thousands of years 
of scholarship.

A pompous TOUR GUIDE shows off museum-like glass vitrines to 
new and prospective students with their families.

             TOUR GUIDE 
      The South Hall library is a church, 
      and these are the sacraments. 

Allen stumbles along on the tour. The tour guide points to 
the contents of the vitrines: the wonders of literary 
history.

             TOUR GUIDE
      Original folios of the most 
      important texts in history. 
      Beowolf. First folio Hamlet. The 
      Gutenberg Bible.

Allen looks down, amazed. Thats Shakespeares handwriting. 

             TOUR
      These are among the Universitys 
      most prized possessions.

Suddenly, in a reflection in the glass, a flash of RED 
catches Allen's eye. 

             LUCIEN
	(O.S.)
      Let's hear a bit, shall we?

Allen turns to see Lucien Carr (now 19, devilish, stunningly 
handsome) LEAP onto a library desk with a book in hand. He 
wears a distinctive red CRAVAT that only the truly beautiful 
can pull off. The entire room hushes.

             LUCIEN
        (reciting)
      On a Sunday afternoon, when the 
      shutters are down and the 
      proletariat possesses the street...

The tour guide looks around confused.


                                      9.
             LUCIEN
      ...there are certain thoroughfares 
      which remind one of nothing less...

Lucien gets on his knees and THRUSTS a lamp between his legs.

             LUCIEN
      ...than a big cancerous cock.

Parents look around in shock. A female student is instantly 
aroused. The prim PERMISSIONS LIBRARIAN clomps over. 

             PERMISSIONS LIBRARIAN
      What is this nonsense?

             LUCIEN
      Henry Miller. 

             PERMISSIONS LIBRARIAN
      Get down immediately. That book is 
      restricted. 

             LUCIEN
      Which is why I committed it to 
      memory.

             PERMISSIONS LIBRARIAN
      Security!

As two Campus Security Guards rush in, Lucien leaps down in 
front of Allen.

             LUCIEN
      Alert the press! Tell them Lucien 
      Carr is innocent!

Lucien flees, rushes out of the library. 

             TOUR GUIDE
      That was highly unusual. Campus is 
      actually quite quiet. Moving on.

But Allen doesn't hear, he grins to himself. Who the hell was 
that? 

             PROFESSOR STEEVES
	(V.O.)
      The Victorian sonnet has the 
      balance of three tenets.

INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY

Patrician, old-guard PROFESSOR STEEVES lectures on the first 
day of class, Allen dutifully taking notes in his journal. 


                                      10.
             PROFESSOR STEEVES
      Rhyme, meter, conceit. Without this 
      balance, a poem becomes slack, 
      sloppy. An untucked shirt.

Allen disagrees and raises his hand.

             ALLEN
      Professor Steeves, then how do you 
      explain Whitman?

No one interrupts Professor Steeves. Murmurs from around the 
class. Steeves locks down his gaze on Allen.

             PROFESSOR STEEVES
      Say more. Two more sentences.

             ALLEN
      He hated rhyme and meter. The whole 
      point was untucking your shirt.

Professor Steeves smiles to himself. Theres one of them 
every year.

             PROFESSOR STEEVES
      What's your name?

             ALLEN
      Allen Ginsberg.

             PROFESSOR STEEVES
      Ginsberg? Your father perhaps is 
      the poet Louis Ginsberg?

Allen nods.

             PROFESSOR STEEVES
      He writes rhyming, metered verse. 
      Why do you think he chose that 
      form?

All eyes on Allen.

             ALLEN
      Because it's easier.

The class titters. Professor Steeves hushes them.

             PROFESSOR STEEVES
      This university exists because of 
      tradition and form. Would you 
      rather this building be built by 
      engineers or Whitman and his boys 
      at play? 


                                      11.
Allen, realizing he is trapped, unable to answer. Professor 
Steeves smiles victoriously and writes on the blackboard.

             PROFESSOR STEEVES
      There can be no creation before 
      imitation. 

The other students take note. Allen sighs, follows suit. From 
the back row, Lucien watches Allen and unsheathes a grin.

INT. ALLEN'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

Luke, dressed in a suit, puts on cologne. He looks back at 
Allen who is copying from a tome of sonnets.

             LUKE
      Shut the books. Were taking my 
      brother with us to the social. He 
      ships out tomorrow. 

             ALLEN
      I cant. You see how much Ive got 
      to do.

             LUKE
      Hes Navy. Its catnip for the 
      skirts.

Luke pulls out his own waistband and sprays some cologne down 
the front. Allen shakes his head. Luke shrugs.

             LUKE
      You hymies are really all about 
      work, huh?

Luke slams the door behind. Allen, alone stares out the 
window.

A record starts up down the hall. Clarinet, strings. Allens 
ears prick up. He knows this tune.

Its the same BRAHMS from his mothers bedroom.

INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT

Allen walks down a darkened hallway, the music leading him 
forward. He reaches a door with a lit transom. He knocks.

The unlocked door creaks open. 


INT. LUCIEN CARRS DORM ROOM - NIGHT
A mattress lies on the floor, a phonograph on top. Candles 
light the room. Books for furniture. And Lucien on the floor, 
reading the Times and smoking.

                                      12.

             ALLEN
      Brahms?

Allen walks inside. Lucien looks up, surprised. 

             LUCIEN
      Finally. An oasis in this 
      wasteland. 

Nervous, Allen tries to make conversation.

             ALLEN
      How come you're not at the social?

             LUCIEN
      Only the most anti-social have to 
      go to an event actually called one. 
      Libation?

Lucien rises and grabs a wine bottle corked with a sock. 
Allen looks nervously towards the door.

             ALLEN
      You drink in your room?!

             LUCIEN
      How does a horrible bottle of 
      Chianti sound?

Lucien inverts two small glasses and pours. Allen stares. He 
doesnt break the rules.

             ALLEN
      I dont drink.

             LUCIEN
      Freshman?

             ALLEN
      Yes.


Lucien hands him his glass.

             LUCIEN
      Excellent. I love first times. I 
      want my whole life to be composed 
      of them. Life is only interesting 
      if life is wide.


                                      13.
Lucien toasts Allens glass.

             LUCIEN
      To Walt Whitman, you dirty bastard.

Allen, mortified, not sure how to take that reference as 
Lucien knocks his wine back in one gulp. 

             LUCIEN
      How's your Yeats? Have you read A 
      Vision?

He tosses Allen a BOOK. Dog-eared, underlined and crumbling.

             ALLEN
      Never heard of it.

             LUCIEN
      It's completely brilliant and 
      impossible. He says life is round: 
      we're stuck on this wheel. Living. 
      And dying.

Allen opens the book, looks through the old pages, sees a 
strange symbol: a diagram of a celestial WHEEL.

             LUCIEN
      An endless circle. Until. Someone 
      breaks it. You came in here, you 
      rupture the pattern. Bang: the 
      whole world...

	       ALLEN
	Gets wider.

		LUCIEN
	Gets wider.


Lucien looks at Allen, amazed.

             LUCIEN
      How did you...?

             ALLEN
      Consonance. Reiteration of themes. 

Lucien, intrigued, circles in close.

             LUCIEN
      Are you a writer? Because Ive got 
      a job for a writer.

Allen, mesmerized. 

             ALLEN
      No. I'm not.


                                      14.
             LUCIEN
      Well, youre not anything yet. 

This boy so close, the rush of contact. From down the hall...

             HALL MONITOR
	(O.S.)
      Ginsberg?!

Allen doesnt even register his name. Lucien smirks.

             LUCIEN
      Isn't that you?

             HALL MONITOR
	(O.S.)
      Ginsberg?!

Allen groans, snaps out of it.

             ALLEN
      What?!

             HALL MONITOR
	(O.S.)
      Phone call!

Allen reluctantly hands Lucien back the BOOK.

             ALLEN
      Ill be back.

INT. DORM HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

The Hall Monitor hands Allen the phone. 

             ALLEN
      Hello?

             NAOMI
	(O.S.)
      I found the wires.

INT. HALLWAY, GINSBERG HOME - NIGHT

Naomi grips the phone desperately. We see she has stripped 
the wallpaper from the wall and pulled the telephone wire out 
from underneath. 

             NAOMI
      Hes trying to get inside my head.

             ALLEN
	(O.S.)
      Dad is not trying to get inside 
      your head, okay? Put him on.


                                      15.
             NAOMI 
      Hes not home. He left. 

INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT

Allen, confused. Up the hallway, a door locks. 

             ALLEN 
      Whered he go?

INT. GINSBERG HOME - NIGHT

Naomi looks out the window, does not want to answer.

             NAOMI
      Honey, I need you come home now.

             ALLEN
	(O.S.)
      Mom I cant come home. Listen, you 
      have to look after yourself.

             NAOMI
      I dont feel good. 

INT. DORM HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Lucien passes Allen, putting on his coat, heading out to the 
city.

             ALLEN
        (whispered, to Lucien)
      Youre going to the dance?

             LUCIEN
      No. Downtown.

             NAOMI
	(O.S.)
      Who are you talking to? Is he there 
      with you?!

             ALLEN
      No, hes not here with me.

Lucien quickly waves goodbye to Allen, heads down the 
staircase. Allen, torn between his mother and this boy.

             ALLEN
        (into the phone)
      Listen, I'll come as soon as I can.


                                      16.
INT. GINSBERG HOME - NIGHT

Naomi, clutches the phone, deadly serious.

             NAOMI 
      You need to promise.

INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT

Lucien slides down the stairway rail. Allen watching him 
disappear.

             ALLEN
      Yes. Ipromiseloveyoubye.

Allen hangs up on his mother and races after Lucien.

INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

Allen, breathless, storms down a flight of stairs, catches up 
to Lucien. Lucien turns, loving this. The puppy following his 
new master.

             LUCIEN
      Coming?

EXT. COLUMBIA ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Lucien throws his jacket over Allens shoulder and leads him 
into the wild city around the corner. 

             LUCIEN
      Welcome to the edge of the world.

The sound of the IRT screeching takes us to the SUBWAY MAP 
from Allens dorm room which comes to life. 

A RED LINE glides down the map from Columbia University all 
the way...to Greenwich Village.

                                  CUT TO:

INT. STAIRS/APARTMENT, 48 MORTON STREET - NIGHT

Allen, anxious, follows Lucien up a crowded staircase to a 
West Village apartment. 

The sounds of a party spill out onto the landing and beyond. 
Its pure bohemia here. 


                                      17.
Smoke, artists flirting, arguing. Allen sees...

A black man making out with a white woman. An older, elegant 
woman sharing a cigarette with a boy half her age.

She stares seductively at Allen. Lucien enjoying himself 
immensely. This is what a first time looks like.

             LUCIEN
      Allen in Wonderland.

Lucien grabs a DRUNK YOUNG GIRL from the crowd, kisses her 
passionately. Then lets her go, keeps walking.

             ALLEN
      Do you know her?!

             LUCIEN
      No, and I don't plan on it. She 
      tasted like imported sophistication 
      and domestic cigarettes.

INT. BATHROOM, 48 MORTON APARTMENT - NIGHT

A makeshift bar in a sink full of ice. Lucien scavenges 
through empty bottles in the sink, looking for any remaining 
alcohol.

             LUCIEN
        (calling out)
      Dave! Wheres the liquor?! I'll be 
      right back.

As Lucien walks off, Allen tries to make himself 
inconspicuous and sits down on the tub. 

             BILL
	(O.S.)
      Hrffrff hrffrfffrfrfrrf.

Allen looks down to see WILLIAM BURROUGHS (aka BILL, 29, 
tall, gaunt, wry), in a suit, sprawled out in the bathtub: a 
gas mask over his mouth. Bill motions to the side of the tub.

             BILL
        (through the mask)
      You're...pinching...

Allen stands up, realizing his foot is on a snaking black 
tube leading to a metal canister of gas.

             ALLEN
      Sorry. Are you all right?


                                      18.
             BILL
        (long exhale)
      Artifacts in the visual field, some 
      light-headedness. Motor 
      hyperactivity. 

             ALLEN
      What is that?

             BILL
      Nitrous oxide, for narcoanalysis. 
      Know thyself. And beshit thyself. 
      Ever done that?

Allen shakes his head no. Bill turns off the gas. Offers a 
joint to Allen.

             ALLEN
      Oh no, thanks. I don't do...the 
      cannabis. 

Bill eyes Allen, skeptically.

             BILL
      Show me the man both sober and 
      happy, and I'll show you the 
      crinkled anus of a lying asshole.

Allen raises an eyebrow. Lucien returns with a paper in hand. 

             LUCIEN
      Allen, Willy. Willy, Allen, Lucien 
      reefer.

Lucien takes the joint.

Bill puts the tube of gas back in his mouth, back to 
business. Lucien grabs Allen's hand, pulls him to the party. 

             ALLEN
        (whispered)
      Is he a criminal?

             LUCIEN
      He wishes he were a criminal. The 
      Burroughs family is richer than 
      God. 

             ALLEN
      He looks like a criminal.


                                      19.
             LUCIEN
      Hes a Harvard man, and hes going 
      to be an amazing artist. His 
      current medium is himself.

Allen spots the TERM PAPER in Lucien's hand.

             ALLEN
      Whats that?

             LUCIEN
      Bunk for school. Now, come on, I 
      want you to meet our host.

INT. LIVING ROOM, 48 MORTON APARTMENT - NIGHT

DAVID KAMMERER, the man we saw dead at the film's opening, 
runs his fingers on the rim of a wine glass. Hes sharp, the 
mayor of this scene. An eerie hum from the glass.

             DAVID
      What there is, darlings and 
      demoiselles, is a circle. Life is 
      round. Patterns, routines, a wheel 
      of self-abuse. Margaret, don't even 
      deny it.

Allen turns to Lucien. 

             ALLEN
        (whispered)
      Sounds like you.

             LUCIEN
      Because it was me. First.

David sees the boys talking. He eyes Allen, curiously.

             DAVID
      Until. The the disruption we long 
      for, comes along and the circle is 
      broken.

             LUCIEN
        (whispered, to Allen)
      He said he was my guardian angel, 
      but that I was too much work.

David crosses through crowd towards Allen.

             DAVID
      Take this unbloomed stalwart.


Uh-oh. Allens singled out. David pulls him to the center of the room. 

                                      20.

             DAVID
      And you are?

             ALLEN
      Allen.

Bill walks in, knows what game his friend is playing.

             BILL
      Play nice, David.

             DAVID
      Allen, who comes uninvited to my 
      apartment. 

             LUCIEN
      Actually I invited him.

             DAVID
      None of us notice him. Look at him. 
      Why would we bother?

In his tucked shirt and creased pants, Allen realizes the 
entire party is scrutinizing, judging him. 

             DAVID
      So the pattern of our evening, our 
      lives, holds. But under the right 
      circumstances, even he might change 
      the world.

Jazz music sparks, PRE-LAP from where this partys going 
next. Lucien eyes Allen -- an idea forming.

                                  CUT TO:

INT. TAVERN - NIGHT

The party continuing at this underground speakeasy. Straight, 
gay, young, old, a subterranean zoo. A jazz signer owns the 
room. 

Bill, David, and Allen at a table. Davids moment alone with 
Allen.

             DAVID
      So you just met Lucien in the lunch 
      line and now he's all that you can 
      see.


                                      21.
             ALLEN
      Why dont you like me?

             BILL
      Because David was in the same 
      godforsaken line.

David and Bill share a knowing look. Lucien returns to the 
table and slams a glass down.

             LUCIEN
      Some earjob at the bar just called 
      me "boy." So I stole his drink.

Allen scans, sees the famous poet OGDEN NASH looking around 
for his glass.

             ALLEN
      That's Ogden Nash!  

             LUCIEN
      Whos Ogden Nash?

             ALLEN
      The best selling poet in the 
      country.

             BILL
      "A girl who is bespectacled. She 
      may not get her nectacled. But 
      safety pins and bassinets--"

             DAVID
      "Await the girl who fassinets.

             LUCIEN
      And thats what hes selling?! I'll 
      kill him.

Bill takes out a switchblade.

             BILL
      Aim for the throat.

A realization. Lucien leans in, focuses his charm.

             LUCIEN
      No. We're not going to kill him. 
      Even better. We're going make sure 
      nobody remembers him.
        (turns to Allen)
      How many men started the 
      Renaissance? 


                                      22.
             ALLEN
      Two. 

             LUCIEN
      And the Romantics.

             DAVID
      More than I suspect this theory 
      accommodates.

             ALLEN
      (Five?)

Luciens passion building. 

             LUCIEN
      We're sending millions to fight the 
      Fascists in Europe, but they're 
      here! Meter and rhyme-

             ALLEN
      And Professor Steeves-

             LUCIEN
      Yes! Theyre all guards in some 
      prison. Lets make the prisoners 
      come out and play. Lets come up 
      with new words, new rhythms.

Allen, swept up in the energy. He couldnt be more 
captivated.

             LUCIEN
      We need a name.

             ALLEN
      How did they come up Dada?

             BILL
      Tristan Tzara jabbed a knife into a 
      dictionary.

             LUCIEN
      Shit. So thats been done.

             DAVID
      A literary revolution without 
      writing a word. Neat trick, Lu.

             BILL
      Well, Im listening.


                                      23.
             ALLEN
      What about Yeats? How about the 
      "New Vision?

             LUCIEN
      Ginsy, you're hired!

Allen smiles a mile wide. Hes in.

Suddenly, the jazz singer stops. The band puts down their 
instruments. POLICEMEN escort a businessman and another 
gentleman out of the bathroom, in HANDCUFFS. The mood in the 
bar chills. 

             BAR-GOER
	(O.S.)
      Fucking perverts.

Allen, terrified, looks at David, who looks back, knowing 
exactly now who Allen is.

A DOOR CRASH leads us to...

EXT. BAR - DAWN

Drunk, Allen and Lucien stumble to the ground.

             LUCIEN
      In the dawn, armed with a burning 
      patience, we shall enter the 
      splendid city!

Allen sits up.

             ALLEN
      Shit.

             LUCIEN
      Its Rimbaud. Its overwritten, I 
      know. Hes allowed.

             ALLEN
      No, my mother. This is bad. This is 
      very bad.

             LUCIEN
      What is?

Allen stands, gathers himself urgently. He needs to be 
somewhere about twelve hours ago.

             ALLEN
      Shes going to be furious.


                                      24.
             LUCIEN
      Don't go then.

             ALLEN
      You don't understand. I have to.

             LUCIEN 
      What?

             ALLEN
      It's complicated.

Lucien sees his friend scared. Moved, he links his arm with 
Allens. 

             LUCIEN
      Perfect. I love complicated. 

INT. GINSBERG HOME - DAY

Allen and Lucien enter the house to find Louis standing 
nervously with a suitcase beside a DOCTOR.

             DOCTOR
      Greystone will alert you if theres 
      a change in her condition. 

A DOCTOR holds out a clipboard. Louis sheepishly signs the 
document on top.

             ALLEN
      Dad, whats going on?

             LOUIS
      Your mother needs her rest.

A male nurse leads Naomi from the bedroom. She is still in 
her robe, shattered and fogged by sedatives. Allen realizes 
whats happening.

             ALLEN
        (to his father)
      You cant do this to her.

Naomi recognizes her son.

             NAOMI
      Where were you?

             ALLEN
      I was out. With a friend.


                                      25.
             NAOMI
      I called you!

             MALE NURSE
      Its time to go, Mrs. Ginsberg.

The nurse takes Naomi to the door. Allen pulls her back, into 
the house.

             ALLEN
      No, youre not leaving.

Naomi points an accusing finger at Louis.

             NAOMI
      He already signed the papers.

             ALLEN
      Dad?!

             LOUIS
      Its for the best.

             ALLEN
      Your best.

             LOUIS
      Its for her best. Its not for my 
      best. Look at her! Listen to her!

Naomi babbling. Allen realizing how far shes gone. Allen 
shoves the nurse off Naomi.

             ALLEN
      Get off!

From deep within, Allen can see she is still there, and we 
can see she knows that its too late.

             NAOMI
      This is your fault.

The nurse escorts a docile Naomi out of the room. Allen 
breaks down. Lucien, mute witness to it all. 

MUSIC PLAYS over...

INT. GINSBERG HALLWAY - NIGHT

Louis lectures Allen.

We close in on Allens despondent face. The dutiful sons 
first failure. 


EXT. GINSBERG FRONT PORCH - NIGHT
Allen escapes outside where Lucien is sitting, smoking. Allen 
sits beside him, notices: Lucien has been crying. 

                                      26.

             ALLEN
      Complicated enough?

             LUCIEN
      At least you have her. My father 
      left me when I was four.

A beat of understanding between them. Lucien lays down. Allen 
takes his cigarette, lays next to him.

             ALLEN
      Ive been thinking about what Yeats 
      said. To be reborn, we have to die 
      first.

Allen hands him back the smoke. Lucien perks up.

             LUCIEN
      So what do you suggest?

INT. LUCIEN CARRS DORM ROOM - NIGHT

Candlelight flickers on Allen's face.

             ALLEN
      I've spent my life making other 
      people happy.

We PULL BACK to see a noose around Allen's neck. A suicide is 
underway.

             ALLEN
      It's time I find happiness the only 
      way I see possible. 

             LUCIEN
	(O.S.)
      Oh please. Die already. 

We PULL BACK again to see Lucien beside, also with a noose 
around his neck. Both of them on chairs. Their nooses are 
attached to the same pipe.

             LUCIEN
      Where's the verve? The brio?!

From atop the chair, Lucien kicks his record player with his 
foot. Grand classical music screeches to a start.


                                      27.
             LUCIEN
      If it be that I am indulging my 
      self-consciousness in justifying 
      myself, or if it be-- 

             ALLEN
      That's a run-on.

             LUCIEN
      Dont edit me!

Lucien shoves Allen. Allen trips off the chair, the noose 
snaps tight...and suddenly hes hanging in mid-air. He 
struggles. Lucien tries to help, but falls off his own chair. 

The pipe starts to bend.

Allen and Lucien panic as they swing through the room, 
suspended in air. 

The pipe BREAKS. They crash to the ground. 

A beat of relief -- are we alive? -- and the two break out 
into hysterics.

DIRTY BE-BOP JAZZ PLAYS OVER...

INT. DAVIDS APARTMENT (48 MORTON) - DAY

Lucien and Allen pace while Bill reclines on the sofa. They 
riff on the The New Vision manifesto.

             ALLEN 
      Proclaims the death of morality. 
      And...


             LUCIEN       The expression of self.

             ALLEN 
      The true, uninhibited, uncensored 
      expression of the self.

             BILL 
      Words, boys. Empty words.

             LUCIEN
      Then what do you suggest?

             BILL
      The derangement of the senses.

                                      28.

INT. 48 MORTON APARTMENT - DAY

Bill cracking open a Benzedrine canister and removing the 
soaking strip from inside. 

He drops it into three coffee cups. The boys knock it back, 
Lucien pushing Allen to finish the whole drink.

                                  CUT TO:

INT. DORM - DAY

Allen furiously typing up the manifesto at his school desk.

INT. 48 MORTON APARTMENT - DAY

Allen, Lucien pacing with increasing excitement.

Bill smiles. Theyre playing his game.

      Bingo.

The music suddenly stops as we ...

INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY

Professor Steeves lecturing before the class. 

             PROFESSOR STEEVES
      And so while Shakespeare...

He notices Allens empty seat. Unhappy.

             PROFESSOR STEEVES
      All right.

The MUSIC builds again as...

                                      29.

Allen stopping Lucien in his tracks.

             ALLEN
      Really?

             LUCIEN
      Its how we make the world wider.

Allen considers, agrees.

             ALLEN
      You are an extraordinary man.

Lucien beams.

             LUCIEN
      Well, thank you.

INT. 48 MORTON APARTMENT - AN HOUR LATER

Bill at Davids bookcase, removing classic art and literature 
books and throwing them to Allen.

	(O.S.)
      Return of the Native. 
      Leviathan. Tear em up boys. 
      Destroy the old and build the new! 

Allen, with scissors, cuts up pages of the books. Hands them 
to Lucien who nails them to the wall. 

Its a frantic assembly-line: Bill whips books to Allen, 
Allen tears out sections, and Lucien hammers them up.

We PULL BACK to see the entire wall is covered in words.

INT. HARLEM NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

Time suddenly slows. The music tapers, the hands of the 
drummer taper down to a still. Allen looks around, scared and 
confused. What is happening?

A spotlight cuts through the room, capturing the singers 
sweaty ecstasy, the bassists fingers mid-plucking. The room 
freezes. 

Unlit cigarette dangling from his lip, Allen turns to Bill. 


                                      31.
Bill holds up his finger - it is on fire. He lights Allens 
cigarette with the flame. We have entered into another 
universe.

Lucien stands -- the only thing moving -- and Allen follows. 
He steps into the frozen moment. And its beautiful.

             LUCIEN
      Watch this.

Lucien leans over a young woman, a statue at a table with a 
young man in military attire. 

             LUCIEN
        (whispered in her ear)
      Go.

The girl comes to life and clambers over the young man to a 
second, more attractive soldier. And kisses him. The pair 
erupt into life, into desire.

Lucien and Allen sit on the stage beneath the frozen 
musicians. Lucien pulls out a BOY SCOUT KNIFE. 

Wraps Allen's hand in a fist around the blade. 

He pulls the knife free. Allen winces in pain. 

Lucien does the same to his own palm, then presses their two 
bloody hands together. A ceremony. Allen's eyes roll back.

David appears in a janitor uniform. The Technicolor fades.

             DAVID
      What the hell is this?

                                  CUT TO:

INT. 48 MORTON APARTMENT - NIGHT 

Allen, the nitrous oxide mask over his face inhaling from a 
tank of gas. He has been adrift in a hallucination. 

Lucien presses Allens hand back and forth, both unharmed.

             BILL
      Time slows down as you drift deeper 
      and deeper into your cave...

Bill notices David, turns off the gas.


                                      32.
             BILL
      We are exploring the avenues of 
      Allens mind.

David looks around the mess of his living room, his pillaged 
library of books, papers all over the floor.

             DAVID
      Dimly-lit, I am sure. What have you 
      done to my apartment?

Allen struggles to his feet, moaning. Lucien steps between 
David and their wall of clippings.

             LUCIEN
      David, don't touch anything. We 
      have to write it all down.

Bill stands up, woozy. Calls out to David.

             BILL
      Get this man a pair of scissors! 

             DAVID
      This is not your revolution, this 
      is my life. 

             BILL
      What kind of life is it?

             DAVID
      Its mine. Not everyone gets an 
      allowance.
        (beat)
      Leave. Get out!

Allen stumbles out of the room, scared. David approaches 
Lucien. 

             DAVID
      I need to speak to you. Alone.

INT. BATHROOM, 48 MORTON APARTMENT - NIGHT

Allen splashes water on his face. In the mirror, he sees 
David and Lucien in the bedroom. 

David hands Lucien a TERM PAPER.

             LUCIEN 
	(O.S.)
      It only has to be five pages.


He tilts the mirror to see them clearly. A glimpse into their private dynamic.

                                      33.

INT. BEDROOM, 48 MORTON APARTMENT - NIGHT

Lucien flips through the term paper.

             LUCIEN
      You make me too smart, theyre 
      gonna suspect somethings up.

David throws Luciens coat over his shoulder.

             DAVID
      And get you sent back to your 
      mother again? That would just be 
      the end of you.

             LUCIEN
      Fuck you.

David spots Allen watching from the bathroom.

INT. BATHROOM - 48 MORTON APARTMENT - NIGHT

Allen, caught, looks down, pretends he heard nothing. But 
its too late. David walks over and SLAMS the door in Allens 
face.

             PROFESSOR STEEVES
	(O.S.)
      Kill your darlings.

INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY

Professor Steeves, intent, in front of the class.

             PROFESSOR STEEVES
      Your crushes, your juvenile 
      metaphysics. None of them belong on 
      the page. It is the first principle 
      of good creative work. A work of 
      fiction you will deliver as your 
      final exam.

He sees Allen, badly hungover and brooding, writing in a 
journal. Ignoring class.

             PROFESSOR STEEVES
      Oh look. Whitman Jr. graced us with 
      his presence today.


Steeves walks to Allen's desk, grabs his journal.
                                      34.

             PROFESSOR STEEVES
      "The New Vision. Extraordinary men 
      propel us forward. It is our duty 
      to break the law."
        (to Allen)
      Fantastic.

             ALLEN
      There's more life in those five 
      pages than in the dozens of bad 
      sonnets we've read in class.

Steeves cocks his eye, stares down Allen. The first time 
Allen has defied anyone. Ever.

             PROFESSOR STEEVES
      You want life? You want the world 
      on fire? 

Steeves motions to the door. Then to Allen.

             PROFESSOR STEEVES
      The war awaits. What will it be?

Steeves tosses the journal back down on Allen's desk. 

Allen looks down at the New Vision, ashamed.

INT. LUCIEN CARR'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

A rainstorm beating against the windows. Allen paces as a 
drunk Lucien knocks off a bottle of wine and reads from 
Allen's journal.

             LUCIEN
      "The rose that scents the summer 
      air/ grows from my beloved's 
      hair...?"

             ALLEN
      Keep going. That's my sonnet for 
      Steeves. 

Lucien flips through the journal, closes it, disappointed.

             LUCIEN
      We have the map. We have the 
      manifesto. We need the work.
        (suddenly cold)
      I was wrong. Maybe you're not up 
      for this after all.


Allen stares at Lucien in disbelief. Shocked, Allen rushes to Luciens desk.

                                      35.

             ALLEN
      Show me your fucking map.

             LUCIEN
      Stop!

Allen grabs the pages Lucien has been working on: they are 
covered in doodles - there's nothing there.

             ALLEN 
      Oh right, you don't have anything 
      because David's not here to write 
      it for you!

Lucien stands up, drunk. Furious.

             LUCIEN
      It's complicated.

             ALLEN
      I love complicated.

Lucien steadies himself. Furious.

             LUCIEN
      He's a professor working as a 
      janitor so he can be near his 
      precious Lu-Lu. He is a goddamn 
      fruit who won't let me go.

             ALLEN
      A fruit?

             LUCIEN
      A queer. 

This detonates inside Allen. Lucien crashes to his bed. Allen 
sits beside.

             ALLEN
      Then lets get rid of him.

Lucien softens, leans against Allen. Passing out from the 
liquor.

             LUCIEN
      Right now, I just need you to write 
      us something beautiful.
        (beat)
      First thought, best thought.


                                      36.
Lucien drifts off. Allen shakes, holding Lucien's body for 
the first time. 

We follow Allen's P.O.V. as he runs his finger through 
Luciens hair. He can barely breathe, this close to what he 
finds beautiful.

Allens fingers slide to Luciens cheek. Toward his lips. 

Lucien's eyes open. Allen tenses, afraid. But Lucien suddenly 
takes Allen's finger in his mouth. Sucks it, eyeing Allen the 
whole time.

A thunder-clap. Lucien passed out in Allens lap. We were 
just in Allen's imagination. 

                                  CUT TO:

INT. ALLEN'S DORM ROOM - DAY

Allen at his typewriter. A blank page. Inspired to write 
something beautiful.

We see flashes of the past, snippets of Lucien: their 
contact, Luciens smile. Allen searching through their past. 
All playing in reverse. 

             LUCIEN 
      Allen in Wonderland. 

Is it something? He writes the words down. Flash of their 
past build in a crescendo as he keeps searching, digging 
through moments, leading to...

NOTHING. 

Allens blocked.

Hell need more help if hes going to get to beautiful.

             BILL
	(O.S.)
      Pervitin.

INT. BILLS APARTMENT - DAY

Bill with NORMAN (30s, shady, real criminal) and Allen in his 
dim, bookshelf-lined lair. Bill gives the secret nod to 
Norman. 


                                      37.
             BILL
      The Germans call it the wonder 
      drug. Prescribed for super-human 
      feats.

Norman pops open a briefcase full of drugs. Bill selects a 
green pill bottle and gives it to Allen.

INT. ALLENS DORM ROOM - DAY

Allen pops two. Waits for it.

INT. ALLENS DORM ROOM - LATER

The pace of everything has DOUBLED. 

Allen, sweating at his typewriter, jubilant, tapping his foot 
with the music, typing furiously at the keys. Whatever this 
drug is, its working.

             BILL
	(O.S.)
      But beware of the side-effects. 

INT. BILLS APARTMENT - DAY

Bill rattles off the list.

             BILL
      Sudden blindness, bouts of 
      diarrhea, heart palpitations, and a 
      severe decline in moral standards. 

                                  CUT TO:

INT. ALLENS DORM ROOM - DAY

Allen jerking-off at his desk. 

Allen racing around his room, burning off energy. The 
memories are now flooding in.

David at his party...

             DAVID
	(O.S.)
      Take this unbloomed stalwart.

Lucien at the bar...


                                      38.
             LUCIEN
	(O.S.)
      Let the prisoners come out and 
      play.

INT. ALLEN'S DORM ROOM - EVENING

Luke enters, turns on the light.

His jaw-drops: Allen is on his bed, running in place like a 
mad-man. 

             LUKE
      What the hell are you doing?

Allen, furious at the interruption.

             ALLEN
      Writing!

INT. BILLS APARTMENT - DAY

Bill, a thoughtful eye on young Allen.

             BILL
      But the words, oh the words...

INT. ALLENS DORM ROOM - DAY

Allens got it. He rips the pages from the typewriter.

INT. LUCIEN CARR'S DORM ROOM - DAY

Luciens door slams open. A sleepless Allen, hair on end, 
storms into the room, fresh pages in hand.

             ALLEN
      Lu! Its very rough but...

David sits at Luciens desk, writing. Allen stops short. 
David spies the pages in Allen's hand.

             DAVID
      Ah. The "Vision" at last. Can I 
      see?

Allen hides them behind his back.

             ALLEN
      Where's Lu?


                                      39.
             DAVID
      He's out. With a senior, some 
      football player. A writer and 
      handsome too.
        (beat)
      James? Jack. There it is. Jack. 

             ALLEN
      You're not allowed to be here.

             DAVID
      That's odd since I'm the only thing 
      keeping him here.

             ALLEN
      Not anymore.

A stand-off. David collects his jacket, approaches. 

             DAVID
      Piece of advice. You dont know Lu. 
      As soon you think you do, hell 
      find someone else.

David smirks, walks off leaving Allen alone with his pages.

             DAVID
      Or maybe he already has.

INT. LUCIEN CARR'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

3:00 AM. Allen snoring. Then the sound of the door creaking 
open. Allen wakes up to see Lucien entering.

             LUCIEN
      What are you, moving in?

             ALLEN
      Where have you been?!

Lucien starts getting undressed.

             LUCIEN
      I found a real writer. Already a 
      million words under his belt before 
      Columbia.

             ALLEN
      You mean Jack?

Lucien fumbles.


                                      40.
             ALLEN
      Why didn't you tell me?

             LUCIEN
      What am I supposed to do? 
      Newsreels? 

He spots the piece of paper in Allen's hand.

             LUCIEN
      What's that?

Defensive, Allen pockets his poem for Lucien.

             ALLEN
      Nothing.

Lucien gets into bed.

             LUCIEN
      If youre going to stay, dont hog 
      the blanket.

Lucien closes his eyes. Allen sits up, jealous, his mind 
spinning. He stares at Lucien.

             ALLEN
      Why is Jack a real writer?

             LUCIEN
      Once you meet him, youll see what 
      I mean.

             JACK
	(O.S.)
      Hey Al! 

INT. 118TH STREET APARTMENT - NIGHT

Handsome JACK KEROUAC (mid-20s, athletic, infamous jaw) 
palms a football, fakes a pass to Allen. Allen, on the couch 
with a stack of pages, shakes his head. 

             ALLEN
      No.

Lucien drinks wine beside. Jack ignores Allen, wings the 
pigskin right at him. Allen ducks. The ball SLAMS into a 
painting on the wall. It crashes onto Allens head.

             EDIE
	(O.S.)
      Jack? What was that?


                                      41.
             JACK
        (with a wink)
      The damn cat!

The bell around the neck of Jacks cat KIT KAT jingles as it 
scurries away. Jack darts over, hangs the painting upside 
down. 

             JACK
        (whispered to Allen)
      She painted it. Say nothing. 

Jack notices a piece of mail addressed to him next to Allen. 
Its an old vinyl RECORD sent by his friend Sammy. He shouts 
down the hall.

             JACK
      Hey whend this come?

             EDIE
	(O.S.)
      Today. Where is Sammy now?

             JACK
      I dunno. Some battleship.

Lucien nods to the huge manuscript on Allens lap. We realize 
it is Jacks novel The Sea Is My Brother. 

             LUCIEN
      What do you think? Brilliant, no?

             ALLEN
      It's missing some periods and 
      commas.

             LUCIEN
      Its better than anything youve 
      ever written.

             ALLEN
      I use periods and commas.

             JACK
      Both of you! Quiet!

Jack sets up an old phonograph. The scratchy record starts as 
Jack sidles up close to the speaker.

             VOICE OF SAMMY
	(O.S.)
      Jack, how are you chum?

             JACK
      Sammy, you bastard.


                                      42.
             LUCIEN
      Whos Sammy?

             JACK
      My best friend since I was twelve. 
      Off in the Navy.

             VOICE OF SAMMY
	(O.S.)
      Weve just been through 20 days of 
      German shelling, every three hours, 
      night and day. This will be my last 
      one for a while. Were headed out 
      to the front. Some beach near Rome. 
      Anzio? 

             EDIE
	(O.S.)
      Come to the table!

             VOICE OF SAMMY
	(O.S.)
      Its supposed to be beautiful...

Jack pulls the stylus off. 

EDIE PARKER, Jacks wealthy, vivacious art student girlfriend 
(early 20's) walks in. Messy, comfortable, adorable. She 
holds a pot, eyes Lucien and Allen.

             EDIE
      I didn't know we were having 
      guests.

Jack comes to the table. She smacks something down on a 
plate: its brown GLOP.

             JACK
      Whats this?

             EDIE
      I was aiming for stew.

             JACK
      You missed.

Jack grabs his jacket.

             EDIE
      Where are you going?

             JACK
      Out.

             EDIE
      Out? I cooked all day for you.


                                      43.
             JACK
      What do you want me to do? Eat shoe 
      leather? I'm hungry and what you do 
      in the kitchen is unholy.

             EDIE
      Thats funny. You talk like a 
      Catholic. But you fuck me and wont 
      marry me. How does that work?

Allen and Lucien watch entranced.

             JACK
      Shut your mouth, Edie.

             EDIE
      I thought you liked it WIDE OPEN...

Jack exits, slams the door shut. Edie stares at Allen and 
Lucien on the couch.

             EDIE
      Scram.

EXT. RIVERSIDE PARK - NIGHT

Lucien drinks from a wine bottle as the three boys stroll. 
Allen trails behind.

             JACK
      So Al. You thought my novel was 
      shit?

             ALLEN
      Not exactly. Its...

             LUCIEN
      It's all true. Jack served in the 
      Merchant Marines.

             JACK
      Ive left school twice already. 
      Columbias full of squares. Im not 
      even sure why I bothered to come 
      back. 

             ALLEN
        (sarcastic)
      Then why don't you just ship out 
      again?


                                      44.
             JACK
      Trust me. Sometimes when I fight 
      with Edie, I want to.

Lucien stops. He spots a DINGY, floating off a dock. He gets 
an idea.

             LUCIEN
      You two did just fight.

             JACK
      Carr, you're goddamn crazy.

Lucien RUNS for it, then Jack. Allen, now the third wheel, 
reluctantly chases after.

EXT. HUDSON RIVER - NIGHT

The dingy drifts into view in the middle of the busiest river 
in the world - quiet at this late in the night. Jack rowing.

             JACK
      A new vision? 

             ALLEN
      Yeah.

             JACK
      Sounds phony. Movements are cooked 
      up by people who cant write about 
      the people who can.

             LUCIEN
      Lu, I dont think he gets what 
      were trying to do.

             JACK
      Listen to me, this whole town's 
      full of finks on the 30th floor, 
      writing pure chintz. Writers, real 
      writers, gotta be in the beds. In 
      the trenches. In all the broken 
      places. What're your trenches, Al?  

             ALLEN
      Allen.

             JACK
      Right.

Allen looks to Lucien for help.


                                      45.
             LUCIEN
      First thought, best thought.

             ALLEN
      Fuck you. What does that even 
      mean?!

             JACK
      Good. That's one. What else?

             ALLEN
      Fuck your one million words.

             JACK
      Even better.

             ALLEN
      You don't know me.

             JACK
      You're right. Who is you?

Lucien loves this, raises an eyebrow. Allen pulls out his 
poem from his pocket. 

             ALLEN
      Be careful.
      You are not in wonderland 
      I have heard the strange madness 
      long growing in your soul.
      But you are fortunate. 

Lucien listens anew, realizing this poem is about him. 

             ALLEN
      In your ignorance
      In your isolation, 
      you who have suffered
      Find where love hides.
      Give. Share. Lose. 
      Lest we die unbloomed.

Just the sound of the water. Completely vulnerable, Allen 
sits back down.

             JACK
      Allen. Beautiful, kid.

Allen looks up, moved. 

             LUCIEN
      You wrote that?


             ALLEN      You asked me to. Remember?

Lucien lights up. He comes forward, gathers his friends 
close: gawky, emotional Allen. Blustery, sensitive Jack.

                                      46.

             LUCIEN
      Forget Columbia. Forget Ogden Nash. 
      Heres the plan, boys. We join the 
      Merchant Marines. Sail the world 
      until the war ends. Then jump ship 
      and make it to Paris. For the 
      liberation.

             ALLEN
      You dont speak French.

             LUCIEN
      Jack does. It'll be us, together. 
      At the beginning. Itll be the 
      perfect day.

A FLOOD-LAMP and HORN shatter the reverie. 

A COAST GUARD patrol boat has caught them. A megaphone 
squawks to life.

             POLICE OFFICER 
      Don't MOVE!

             JACK
      Jesus Christ!

             POLICE OFFICER 
      Put your hands in the air!

The boys, trapped, look at each other terrified. The BLAST of 
the horn sends up to...

                                  CUT TO:

INT. HALLWAY, OUTSIDE COLUMBIA DEANS OFFICE - DAY

Allen, nervous waits outside. Lucien already inside getting 
reprimanded by the Dean. Allen can hear the conversation 
through the door.

He leans in closer.

             DEAN
	(O.S.)
      Youve managed to matriculate and 
      drop out of Tulane, Bowdoin, 
      University of Chicago.


INT. COLUMBIA DEANS OFFICE - DAY
Lucien in a leather-backed chair. The DEAN (40s, sardonic) 
overlooks Luciens record. Luciens mother, MARION CARR, a 
fallen matriarch, smokes with dispassion.

                                      47.

             DEAN
      Your attendance record here is 
      abominable. You've ignored curfew. 
      Your papers, when you bother to 
      turn them in, exceed the assigned 
      page limit. Can you explain why 
      youre at Columbia?

             LUCIEN
      Same reason youre here. 

             DEAN
      Whats that?

             LUCIEN
      Loose Barnard girls.

Marion Carr looks at the Dean with a weary smile. 

             DEAN
      I know about your difficulties. 
      About what happened in Chicago. 

A pale comes over Luciens face. Which becomes absolute fury.

             LUCIEN
        (to Marion)
      You told him?!

             MARION CARR
      Hes not the enemy. 

             DEAN
      See, the University acts in loco 
      parentis. You are our 
      responsibility. Were trying to 
      find someway to make this all work.

Lucien EXPLODES.

             LUCIEN
      Who said anybody could know 
      anything about anything?!

             MARION CARR 
      Lucien, your temper!


INT. HALLWAY, OUTSIDE COLUMBIA DEANS OFFICE - DAY
Allen sits back as he hears someone approaching.

Louis Ginsberg rounds the corner with an unfamiliar woman. 

                                      48.

             LOUIS
	(O.S.)
      Allen? What the hell is going on?

             ALLEN
      Whos she?

The woman, EDITH (early 30s, Jewish, shy), waves nervously.

             EDITH
      Hi. Im Edith Cohen.

             ALLEN
      Whats she doing here?

             EDITH
      Ill go wait outside.

Edith exits down the stairs.

             ALLEN
        (smirks)
      So thats why you locked mom up.

Louis SLAPS his son.

Lucien storms out of the Deans office, followed by Marion, 
putting on her fur coat. Marion inspects her sons new 
accomplice then races after her son. Louis motions to Lucien.

             LOUIS
      Did he put you up to this?

Allen stares down his father. Gathering courage to defy him.

             ALLEN
      No. I stole the boat. And it was 
      tremendous.

EXT. SEMINARY GARDENS - NIGHT

In the quiet, Lucien smokes and stares up -- he looks 
ravaged. A suitcase beside him.

Allen approaches, surprised.

             ALLEN
      Where are you going?


                                      49.
             LUCIEN
      You know me now. I'm only good at 
      beginnings. 

             ALLEN
      Youre dropping out?

             LUCIEN
      Best of luck.

Allen GRABS Luciens suitcase and sits beside Lucien. This 
explodes out of him. 

             ALLEN
      My father shows up yesterday with 
      some new woman. And in the middle 
      of the Allens-a-screw-up 
      monologue, all of a sudden, I 
      realize: I dont care. Ive never 
      not cared. So, I told them it was 
      my idea. To steal the boat.

             LUCIEN
      Why?

             ALLEN
      Because I dont want to be the 
      person they think I am. Im on 
      academic probation. I could be 
      kicked out. You cant leave. You 
      started something and I have no 
      idea what Im supposed to do next.

Lucien, moved. 

             ALLEN
      Its our turn. Lets show them what 
      we can do.

At the thought of payback, Lucien awakens. Allen grins.

             ALLEN
      You in?

INT. LIBRARY, MAIN HALL - DAY

A hard STAMP on a library request: RESTRICTED.

             PERMISSIONS LIBRARIAN 
      You must not drink while youre 
      handling it. And no writing in it. 


                                      50.
Allen, Lucien, Jack and Bill spy on the PERMISSIONS LIBRARIAN 
and a female PAGE at the main desk. The librarian places a 
KEY RING in a drawer.

             PERMISSIONS LIBRARIAN
      It must come back exactly as you 
      found it. 

The Permissions Librarian heads off. Seeing the young page 
alone, Jack tucks in his shirt, SLICKS his hair down. Jabs a 
piece of gum from his mouth into Luciens palm.

             JACK
      No telling Edie, got it?

Jack strolls up to the desk. Winks at the page.

             JACK
      I see you checking out all these 
      books. And Im asking myself: do 
      you ever get checked out?

She radiates. Bill looks at his watch. 

             BILL
      25 seconds. Masterful. 

But then, another page, GWENDOLYN (20, sweet and saucy), 
joins the first. 

             LUCIEN
      Damn! Shifts over.

Jack looks back, shrugs as he walks off with the first page. 
Lucien groans, plan's 86'd. But Allen sits up.

             ALLEN
      I'll go.

INT. PERMISSIONS DESK, LIBRARY, MAIN HALL - DAY

Allen walks up to the desk.

             ALLEN
      Hi.

Gwendolyn looks up. Allen is smiling nervously.

             ALLEN
      I wondered if you could help me.

             GWENDOLYN
      Sure. 


                                      51.
             ALLEN
      Im looking for a book.

             GWENDOLYN
      Okay. Does this book have a title?

             ALLEN
      Its called The Day Amanda Came.

             GWENDOLYN
        (knowing look)
      Well, youll have to wait. I cant 
      leave the desk.

Allen turns back to Lucien who nods, eggs him on.

             ALLEN
      But...I really need it.

Gwendolyn looks around.

             GWENDOLYN
        (flirting)
      Okay. Only for you. 

She places a sign on the desk: HELPING A READER. BACK IN 5 
MINUTES." 

They head off the stacks, Lucien bounds up to the desk, 
glides over the top, and digs through the drawer.

Old cards. Broken pencils. NO KEYS.

             LUCIEN
      Shit!

INT. STACKS - DAY


CLOSE UP: THE KEYS in Gwendolyns hand as Allen and Gwendolyn 
walk through the stacks.

             ALLEN
      Working here must be a drag.

             GWENDOLYN
      I like it. It's the only way I meet 
      boys. They're very strict at 
      Barnard.

             ALLEN
      How strict?


                                      52.
             GWENDOLYN
      For example, they'd never let me do 
      this.

Gwendolyn LIFTS her sweater. Bares her brassiere.

             ALLEN
      Right. No.

INT. PERMISSIONS DESK - CONTINUOUS

Lucien peeks up from behind the desk. Sees Bill staring at 
him.

             BILL
      Go!

Lucien races into the stacks after Allen.

INT. STACKS - CONTINUOUS

             GWENDOLYN
      Did you know Ive never done it 
      with someone who was Jewish before? 
      I really want to know what it looks 
      like.

Gwendolyn paws the front of Allens pants, undoes his belt. 
Uncomfortable, Allen stops her. 

She pulls away, pulls down her sweater. The keys jangling in 
her hand.

             GWENDOLYN
      Im sorry, I thought you were 
      saying something but not saying it. 
      Should we find your book?

THROUGH A GAP IN THE STACKS: Allen sees Lucien, pointing to 
the KEYS in her grip. Realizing what he has to do.

             ALLEN
      There is no book. Take it off.

             GWENDOLYN
      Really?

Gwendolyn sets down the keys. Undoes her cardigan. Lucien 
nabs the keys and races up the stacks.


                                      53.
INT. ROW, LIBRARY STACKS - CONTINUOUS

Lucien hands the keys to Bill. Bill PLACES it into a clay 
molding and makes an impression. 

             GWENDOLYN
	(O.S.)
      No. Why dont you take it off?

INT. STACKS, LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

Allen takes off her sweater. Gwendolyn, just in a bra. This 
is as close as Allen has ever come to sex. Hes breathless.

             GWENDOLYN
      It's not like I'm a virgin. I've 
      done it with three guys already. 
      You're a virgin, huh?

She KISSES him. Cold lips. Hes terrified.

             GWENDOLYN
      Youre kind of a virgin, though, 
      huh?

             ALLEN
      No.

             GWENDOLYN
      Liar. If you have done it before, 
      you'll last for thirty seconds. 
      Start counting.

She opens his fly, then lowers herself down. Allen tries to 
stop her, but it's too late. He sighs.

             ALLEN
      1...2...

Lucien returns and see Allen reluctantly getting his first 
blowjob. Lucien leans against the books and watches.

             ALLEN
      3...4...

Lucien flashes Allen a wicked grin. 

             ALLEN
      5...6...

Over Gwendolyn's head, Allen watches Lucien staring at him. 
He starts to get aroused. 


                                      54.
             ALLEN
      7...8...9...

Allen and Lucien holding eye contact, Allen thrusts into her 
mouth, comes. Gwendolyn rises back up, unimpressed, drops her 
sweater. 

             GWENDOLYN
      I knew it. 

She grabs the KEYS that are now back on the shelf. Allen 
looks to find Lucien. But he is gone.

             GWENDOLYN
      I bet you dont even read.

Gwendolyn walks off. Allen lifts his pants, ties his belt.

             ALLEN
      I do.

EXT. COLUMBIA LIBRARY - NIGHT

Shots of the darkened church-like building. Deserted. 
Timeless. 

             LUCIEN
	(O.S.)
      This is it guys. Our Bastille. No 
      chickening out.

INT. CARD CATALOGUE AREA, LIBRARY - NIGHT

The light from the boys flashlights SLICES through the dark 
as they enter into the library through a heavy door.

Bill reaches into Jacks mouth and takes the chewing gum from 
inside it. Jack shoots a glare at him - what the hell?

Bill presses the sticky gum into the strike plate of the door 
-- blocking the door from being able to close shut. 

The boys look at each other, give each other the silent nod, 
then split -- Lucien and Jack sneak off to the main hall, 
Bill and Allen up to the stacks.

Behind them, the chewing gum slips, falls from the strike 
plate. The door shuts. 

And LOCKS.


                                      55.
INT. STACKS - NIGHT

Outside a gated RESTRICTED ACCESS room, Bill grabs the 
padded LOCK and fits in his molded KEY. Allen watches as he 
turns it... 

The lock CLICKS open.

INT. LIBRARY, MAIN HALL - NIGHT

Jack and Lucien unscrew the glass from the VITRINES encasing 
the historic books and manuscripts we saw earlier. 

EXT. LIBRARY - NIGHT

Walking into the light of the street lamp outside the library 
is David. He approaches two campus security GUARDS on the 
night patrol. 

             DAVID
      Excuse me. I think I saw some light 
      or movement in the library. 

The security guards FLASH their lights at the facade. 

INT. RESTRICTED ACCESS ROOM - NIGHT 

Bill throws open the metal gate between them and the 
restricted books inside. 

An ALARM explodes into the quiet. 

Bill and Allen look at each other: this was unexpected.

INT. LIBRARY, MAIN HALL - NIGHT

Jack and Lucien jolt as the alarm goes off, look up from the 
vitrines to each other. What is going on up there?

EXT. LIBRARY - NIGHT

The guards hear the alarm coming from inside the library. 
They race to unlock the CHAIN holding the doors locked 
together.


                                      56.
INT. RESTRICTED ACCESS ROOM - NIGHT 

Bill rushes past the gate, shines his flashlight searching 
the books until he finds a box marked RESTRICTED CONTENT. 

He empties it, tossing the books to Allen. Weve seen this 
move before.

INT. LIBRARY, MAIN HALL - NIGHT

Allen, carrying the restricted books, runs up to Jack and 
Lucien at the vitrines which are now wide open and empty.

             JACK
        (whispered)
      What just happened?

Jack and Lucien grab the books from Allen and start to set 
them in the cases. The alarm suddenly STOPS.

             SECURITY GUARD
	(O.S.)
      We know youre here!

The footsteps of the guards approach. Game over. Their work 
not done, the boys RACE back to the door they came through. 

All EXCEPT LUCIEN. He ducks behind the vitrine, hiding. He 
clicks off his flashlight.

The guards ENTER the main hall, searching for the culprits.

INT. CARD CATALOGUE AREA - CONTINUOUS

Allen, Jack and Bill reach the closed door. They cant open 
it.

             JACK
      What the hell, Bill? Its locked!

No way out. Allen turns, notices Lucien is missing.

INT. LIBRARY, MAIN HALL - CONTINUOUS

The guards step right past Lucien and STOP. Lucien ducks, 
rounds to the side of the case.

             GUARD
      Did you hear that?


                                      57.
INT. CARD CATALOGUE AREA - CONTINUOUS

Bill, Jack and Allen slide along the wall of card catalogs, 
back to the main hall looking for another exit. 

Through the arch leading inside, they can see the guards 
canvasing the room with flashlights.

             SECURITY GUARD
      We know youre here!

             SECURITY GUARD #2
      Come on out!

Across the room, Bill spots TWO GLASS DOORS leading out to a 
balcony. He points at the doors. 

Jack WHIPS his flashlight in a tremendous arc to another 
room. It clatters noisily, a distraction. 

It works. The guards CHASE after the noise.

Jack, Bill, Allen BOLT to the glass doors. They throw them 
wide open. Allen is about to leave, but stops Jack.

             ALLEN
      Wait. Lucien.

Allen turns and sees Lucien, still furiously working, books 
under his arm.

Jack shakes his head, follows Bill and races out the door. 
Alone, Allen RUNS back to Lucien who is madly placing the 
books in the vitrines. He is a man possessed. 

             ALLEN
      Lu thats enough. Come on! Whats 
      wrong with you?

             LUCIEN
        (deadly serious)
      No. Not yet, we have to finish.

A FLASHLIGHT finds them. Allen and Lucien, caught. The guards 
pull out BILLY CLUBS.

             SECURITY GUARD
      Dont move. Its over.

The guards GRAB Lucien. Drag him by the collar. But Allen 
flees, breaks free. Lucien struggles, enraged.

             LUCIEN
      Get off of me! Allen! Help!


                                      58.
INT. CARD CATALOGUE AREA - CONTINUOUS

Allen stops, terrified. He sees: a console of switches on the 
wall. Desperate, he reaches for them. Flips them all on.

INT. LIBRARY, MAIN HALL - CONTINUOUS

All the lights in the whole library come on at once. A 
BLINDING flash. 

The guards squint and look for Allen. 

INT. CARD CATALOGUE AREA - CONTINUOUS

Allen THROWS down all the switches.

INT. LIBRARY, MAIN HALL - CONTINUOUS

The room PLUNGES into complete darkness. 

Lucien realizes: this is his moment. 

He wriggles out of his coat and RUNS. Allen JOINS him and the 
two, reunited, run around the corner.

The guards give chase.

INT. ENTRANCE FOYER - CONTINUOUS

Allen and Lucien race into the vestibule between the doors 
leading out to the city -- and the doors back into the 
library.

Lucien presses against the exit doors: theyre locked.

The GUARDS turn the corner, see the boys stuck between the 
two sets of doors.

Allen blocks the library doors with his shoulder. The guards 
POUND on the door.

A SOUND from outside: the padlock unlocking. Suddenly: the 
exit door opens. Its Jack and Bill, with lock-picking gear 
in hand.

They YANK Allen and Lucien out. 


                                      59.
EXT. LIBRARY - NIGHT

Jack slams the door, Bill runs the chain back through the 
handle and LOCKS it. 

The door BULGES as the guards bang into it. 

             SECURITY GUARD 
      Open the goddamn door! Open this 
      up!

The boys turn and RUN down the grand steps leading back to 
the campus. Glee on their faces.

                                  CUT TO:

EXT. LIBRARY - DAY

The same grand steps the next morning. Students walking up 
and down it to class, socializing, as if nothing happened 
there the night before.

INT. LIBRARY, MAIN HALL - DAY

Inside, the pompous TOUR GUIDE from earlier showing off the 
vitrines to a new crowd of parents and incoming students.

             TOUR GUIDE
      The South Hall library is a church, 
      and these are the sacraments.

The crowd mumbles, then laughs. The guide, confused, looks 
inside them to see the Kama Sutra opened up to a particularly 
salacious page. 

The explicit images from a Grecian urn. 

Lady Chatterlys Lover, Ulysses, all the books banned, 
restricted, kept from public eye. 

And lastly: Tropic of Cancer. By Henry Miller.

The prisoners have come out to play.

             TOUR GUIDE
      Oh. My. God.

And a note, left on the glass: "The New Vision."


                                      60.
INT. WEST END BAR - DAY

Four shot glasses. Four hands.

             LUCIEN
      To literacy.

Allen, Bill, Jack and Lucien throw back their drinks in 
celebration.

The Mills Brothers "You Always Hurt The One You Love" on the 
jukebox plays over this lazy, drunken afternoon. 

Allens eyes scan the wall above them, Columbias Hall of 
Fame: newspaper headlines, yearbook photos...

             ALLEN
      Jack, thats you, isnt it?

He sees a framed photo of Jack in a football play, mid-catch.

             JACK
      Yep. Last year. They still won. 

             LUCIEN
      Look at them!

And we do: we see FLASHES of the photos: ribbon-cuttings, 
team-photos, graduations: life in a thousand fake smiles and 
stagings.

             LUCIEN
      Souvenir history. To make people 
      think they left some mark on the 
      world. Because otherwise nobody 
      would ever know.
        (beat)
      I dont ever want to end up on this 
      wall.

             JACK
      Have no fear. You never will.

Suddenly, David appears in the bar. The group looks at each 
other, mystified.

             ALLEN
      Whats he doing here?

David walks briskly over to Lucien. 

             DAVID
      Since you didn't show up earlier, I 
      just hoped to give you this.


David drops a TERM PAPER on the table: On the Decline of the West.  Allen leans over the table, inserting himself into 
the conversation.

                                      61.

             ALLEN
      Maybe he didn't want to see you.

             DAVID
      I think he can speak for himself.

             LUCIEN
      Yup. And he says we should all have 
      another round... 

Lucien stands up to get a drink. David grabs his arm. Lucien 
tries to push him off.

             DAVID
      You've had plenty of time to 
      celebrate. Your library hijink made 
      the morning paper. I'm sure you're 
      all very proud.

Allen, Jack and Bill glance at each other suspiciously, then 
at David.

             ALLEN
      How did you know it was us?

             DAVID
      Did he use that "Bastille" line? 
      Cause I gave it to him. 

Allen, Jack and Bill look at Lucien, shocked.

             LUCIEN
      I haven't seen you for days.

David throws down Luciens cravat to the table. The one we 
remember him wearing when we first met him in the library. A 
private power move.

             DAVID
      You left this at my place. 

             ALLEN
        (to David, a guess)
      You told the guards we were there. 
      No one else knew. 

David does not respond. Jack suddenly jolts up. Shoves David 
back.


                                      62.
             JACK
      You little fink!

Lucien explodes at David.

             LUCIEN
      You wanted me to get kicked out?! 
      You ratted on me!

             DAVID
      Stop, Lu. Youre losing control 
      again. You know what comes next. I 
      know what comes next. 

             ALLEN
      Yeah. 
        (to Lucien)
      Cut him off. 

Lucien gives David a fatal look. 

             LUCIEN
      Best of luck, Janitor.

             DAVID
      Excuse me?

             LUCIEN
      We are over. Leave.

Lucien spindles the paper and plunges it into a beer. David 
in shock, begins to shatter in front of them.

             DAVID
      Look at me, Lu.

Tears well in Davids eyes. Lucien sits back down, ignores 
him. Bill stands up, tries to lead David away.

             BILL
      Let's go.

             DAVID
        (from his wound, breaking)
      You said I was everything to you. 
      You are everything to me. 
      Everything to me. Do you hear me? 

David fractures. Utterly vulnerable. This is it: the real 
uninhibited, uncensored self.

             BILL
      Lets go. Time and place, David.


                                      63.
             DAVID
      Shut up, traitor.

He turns sharply to Lucien saying loud enough so everyone can 
hear.

             DAVID
      You'd be dead if it weren't for me!

Lucien totally dead cold. Allen, unsure what David is talking 
about. David turns and rushes outside and Bill follows him. 

Alone with Allen and Jack, Lucien suddenly smiles as if 
nothing just happened, puts his arm around Allen.

             LUCIEN
      Youd be boring if it werent for 
      me!

The two start to crack up together.

EXT. RIVERSIDE PARK - NIGHT

             JACK
      And...go!

Jack crouched inside an empty barrel. Trashed, Lucien kicks 
the barrel down a grassy slope. 

Allen and Lucien cheer Jack on as the barrel bangs down the 
slope. But then it swerves, SLAMS into a bench. At the top of 
the slope, Lucien and Allen look on in shock.

             LUCIEN
      Jack? Jack?
        (no response)
      He broke his fucking neck. The 
      warrior poet has passed on.

Jack staggers from out of the barrel. Throws his hands in the 
air victoriously. Allen and Lucien cheer him on.

             ALLEN
      No, he lives!

             LUCIEN 
      Excellent! Judges award a...

Allen holds up nine fingers. 

             ALLEN
      Nine!


                                      64.
Jack falls to his knees, pukes. Allen and Lucien crack up.

             LUCIEN
      All right Ginsy, your turn.

Drunk, Allen tries to stand up. But then falls right back 
down. Lucien laughs, tucks his body next to Allens.

             LUCIEN
      This is just the beginning, you 
      know.

Lucien lays his head against Allens shoulder.

             LUCIEN
      Your fault, Ginsy. Its all your 
      fault.

Lucien's thigh brushes against Allen's. 

Allen stares at Lucien, in the full glare of Luciens warmth. 

Allen looks around. The park is empty. Building up the 
courage.

             ALLEN
      First thought, best thought.

He grazes his hand against Luciens inner thigh. Lucien looks 
down at Allen's hand curiously, then back at Allen.

The decisive moment. Allen leans over. Kisses him. It builds 
in passion. 

Lucien pulls back, unsure. Then returns the kiss. It builds 
in passion. 

Everything Allen had hoped for, lensed into a moment. 

             JACK
	(O.S.)
      I think I just puked on the inside.

Lucien opens his eyes to notice Jack stumbling up the slope.

He tenses, pulls away from Allen. 

The moment has been shattered. 

As if nothing just happened, Lucien stands and looks at Jack 
with his usual devilish smile.

             LUCIEN
      Let's go, Jack.


                                      65.
He throws his arm around Jacks shoulder, turning his back to 
Allen. They start to walk off. Jack stops, turns back to 
Allen.

             JACK
      Wait, Al, you coming?

Lucien glares at Allen. 

             LUCIEN
      No. Allens got work to do. Ten 
      pages on Spenglers Decline of the 
      West. Due tomorrow.

             ALLEN
      Excuse me?

             LUCIEN
      I'd be lost without you, Ginsy. 
        (to Jack)
      Come on, Lion. 

The two of them leave. Allen, abandoned and broken, puts his 
head in his hands.

             ALLEN
      Fuck. Fuck!

INT. 118TH STREET APARTMENT - NIGHT

Lucien and Jack stumble into Jacks apartment. Edie sits with 
GRANDMA FRANKIE (90s, stone-faced) around the living room 
table, listening to the news on the radio. We hear theres 
been an attack in Anzio. 

             JACK
      Edie! Edie bird! 

Lucien looks at Edies stone-cold face. Shes pissed. He 
turns right back around.

             LUCIEN
        (exiting)
      Lus going to use the loo.

             EDIE
      Say hi to Gram.

Grandma Frankie glares at Jack.

             EDIE
      We invited her over for her 
      birthday. We made her a cake.


Jack sees a lumpy, half-eaten cake on the table. Realizing he just messed up big-time.

                                      66.

             JACK
      Then we should have a drink! How 
      about a drink, Grandma Frankie? You 
      want some red wine?

Jack heads to the cabinet. Edie follows him.

             EDIE
      Where the hell have you been?!

             JACK
      I was out.

Edies rage boils over.

             EDIE
      I packed all your stuff. Its in 
      your bag. Im going to be at Grams 
      tonight.

Jack reaches for her. She shakes him off.

             JACK
      Stay. I'm sorry.

             EDIE
      You just say that, but its one of 
      your million words and they dont 
      mean anything!
        (beat)
      Just don't be here when I come back 
      in the morning.

INT. 118TH STREET BEDROOM - LATER

Edies gone. The apartment is quiet. Lucien and Jack, crashed 
out on Jacks bed. 

The sound of a strange KNOCKING against a window outside. 
Lucien wakes up. Sees Jack still asleep.

He rises to investigate.

INT. 118TH STREET APARTMENT - NIGHT

Lucien sees David, desperate, alone, on the fire escape. 
Lucien cant believe this. He opens the window.


                                      67.
             DAVID
      I know this is crazy. I dont know 
      even know what Im doing here. But 
      I had to tell you I'm sorry. Let me 
      make it up to you.

From behind...

             JACK
	(O.S.)
      Lu, where are you? 

Lucien stares down David.

             LUCIEN
      Im going back to bed. Another word 
      and I call the police.

Lucien turns around and leaves David alone at the sill. From 
inside the living room, David hears a MEOW.

He spots Jacks cat KIT KAT looking up at him.

INT. 118TH STREET BEDROOM - LATER

The sound of gas and a violent STRUGGLING from the other 
room. 

Jack quickly wakes up.

             JACK
      What the hell?!

Jack jumps out of bed and grabs a baseball bat.

INT. 118TH STREET APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jack walks up the hallway. The living room, eerily empty. 
Then a howling from the kitchen.

INT. KITCHEN, 118TH STREET APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jack rushes in. Turns on the light. The sounds are coming 
from the OVEN.

He rushes to the oven door and opens it. Kit Kat struggles in 
the oven, gassed and barely alive. Jack turns off the oven, 
clutches his cat.

             JACK
      Its okay. Shhh.
        (turns to Lucien)


                                      68.
      What kind of sick son of a bitch 
      would do something like this?

             LUCIEN
      It was David.

             JACK
      Ill wring his fucking neck.

LUCIEN's P.O.V.: Jack's Merchant Marine duffel bag that Edie 
has fully packed for him.

             LUCIEN
      I have another idea.

INT. LIBRARY, MAIN HALL - THE NEXT DAY

Allen sits at a table at the library he just broke into and 
robbed. But now hes just another student sitting at a study 
desk.

He puts in a blank page in the typewriter before him and 
types: On The Decline of the West. By...

He hesitates, breaking down in tears. 

Then finishes typing: Lucien Carr." 

INT. LUCIEN CARR'S DORM ROOM - DAY

Lucien, in a Merchant Marine uniform, packs his clothes into 
a sailors duffel bag. Allen enters, type-written pages in 
hand.

             ALLEN
      Your paper and my apology.

Allen hands Lucien the paper he wrote for him. But Lucien 
doesnt take it. Allen registers that hes packing.

             ALLEN
      Where are you going?

             LUCIEN 
      Sailing out. To Paris. 

Lucien grabs his BOY-SCOUT KNIFE. Puts it in his pocket. 
Allen is speechless.


                                      69.
             LUCIEN
      Weve got to make a ship, probably 
      as merchant seamen. Jack knows the 
      tricks.

             ALLEN
      You weren't going to tell me?

             LUCIEN
      We both know why you can't come.

Silence. Lucien continues his packing. Allen breaks down.

             ALLEN
      Fuck you. Youre a phony. You got 
      me and Jack and Bill making your 
      vision come true. All because you 
      couldn't do it yourself.

             LUCIEN
      No, you got what you wanted. You 
      were ordinary, just like every 
      other freshman, and I made your 
      life extraordinary. Go be you now, 
      all by yourself. Leave me alone.

Allen, now in tears, realizing the end is here.

             ALLEN
      You don't really mean that.

             LUCIEN
        (cold, deadened)
      Allen. Leave.

Allen gathers himself, stumbles out the door. Leaving the 
friendship behind. 

Alone, Lucien cracks, breaking down as he closes his 
suitcase. 

EXT. SEMINARY COURTYARD - DAY

Allen crosses through the courtyard, heading to class. He 
comes upon David, waiting for Lucien. Pale. Distraught.

             DAVID
      Allen, have you seen him? Hes not 
      in his room.

They look almost the same.


                                      70.
             ALLEN
      He left.

             DAVID
      I did something wrong. Really 
      wrong. And you have no reason to 
      help me. But

             ALLEN
      But?

             DAVID
      I know who you are. Were the ones 
      he needs, but never wants. It 
      hurts, doesn't it?

Allen burns, does not respond. David is right.

             DAVID
      All I am asking is tell me where he 
      is. Please. 

CLOSE ON: Allen, on the blade of a choice.

INT. MERCHANT MARINE, BILLETING OFFICE - EVENING

Jack and Lucien in a long line of young soldiers waiting to 
ship out. Lucien nips at a flask. They reach the front of the 
line. A BILLETING OFFICER calls out to them.

             BILLETING OFFICER
      Lemme see your papers.

             LUCIEN
      Two seamen, reporting for duty.

Jack tries not to laugh, hands over his paperwork. The 
officer points to Lucien.

             BILLETING OFFICER
      What's your name?

             LUCIEN
      Arthur Rimbaud.

Jack rolls his eyes. The officer hands the paperwork back.

             BILLETING OFFICER
      Go upstairs to get on the docket.

             LUCIEN
      Lets go get on the docket.


                                      71.
As they turn to leave, they see David is there, descending 
the stairs. Jack is about to pounce.

             JACK
      Goddamn son of a bitch!

             LUCIEN
      Let me handle this.

Lucien holds Jack back, rushes up to David.

             LUCIEN
      How did you know I would be here?!

             DAVID
      Listen, I spoke to a guy upstairs. 
      I got two passes. I packed for both 
      of us. We can leave.

             LUCIEN
      The reason Im leaving is you.

It doesn't register. Desperate, David holds out the passes.

             DAVID
      Then you and Jack take them. Ill 
      catch up.

Lucien considers this, then makes a fateful decision.

             LUCIEN
      Come with me. Were taking a walk.

INT. TAVERN - NIGHT

Allen, wrecked, walks into the bar where he first drank with 
Lucien.

He sees an older man eyeing him and sits down, terrified.

             ALLEN
      Could I have a whiskey, please?

INT. 118TH STREET APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jack unlocks his door. Edie sits on the floor, her eyes red 
from crying. Jack drops his duffel bag. Sits with her. 

             JACK
      Im sorry.

Edie embraces him. 


                                      72.
INT. TAVERN - NIGHT

Allen sees a young man in a Merchant Marine outfit, blond, 
the bar lamps casting a golden halo around his head. Could it 
be?

             ALLEN
      Lu?

Allen races to him. The man turns and Allens heart sinks. It 
is a SAILOR, a distant echo of Lucien.

The Sailor eyes Allen gently, seductively. 

Allen walks up to him.

INT. 118TH STREET APARTMENT - NIGHT

Edie breaks the embrace.

             EDIE
      This came for you today. 

She hands Jack a package from the mail. A new record. 

             JACK
      Sammy...

Jack places it on the record player and listens, clutching 
Edie. He knows immediately there wont be another record.

             SAMMY
	(V.O.)
      Jack, old chum. I'm on a hospital 
      ship now. My guts all tore up. 

INT. CRAPPY HOTEL, 42ND STREET - NIGHT 

Allen undresses, terrified, as the sailor does the same. 

             SAMMY
	(V.O.)
      Anzios going to be the last place 
      I ever see with my eyes.

INT. BILLS APARTMENT - NIGHT

Bill with Norman, his dealer, in his apartment. Norman 
injects himself with a morphine syrette. Bill watches, 
fascinated.


                                      73.
             SAMMY
	(V.O.)
      A mortar round came and found me in 
      my tent. 

Norman offers the box of morphine to Bill. Bill handles it. 
Considering. 

EXT. RIVERSIDE PARK - NIGHT 

Lucien walks, guzzles from his flask. David follows. They are 
visibly arguing.

             SAMMY
	(V.O.)
      I can feel metal under my skin some 
      places. Some went clean through.

INT. 118TH STREET APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jack continues to listen to Sammy, his heart sinking. He 
knows this is headed to a dark place.

             SAMMY
	(V.O.)
      Theyre not even trying to take it 
      out no more. 

INT. CRAPPY HOTEL, 42ND STREET - NIGHT 

Allens heart in his throat as he steps out of his pants. He 
is nearly naked. Vulnerable. 

EXT. RIVERSIDE PARK - NIGHT 

Lucien throws his flask into the woods, LASHES out at David.

INT. BILLS APARTMENT - NIGHT

Bill injects the syrette into his wrist. And presses the 
oblivion in. 

             SAMMY
	(V.O.)
      The nurses gave me the same 
      morphine I gave to dying boys...

INT. CRAPPY HOTEL, 42ND STREET - NIGHT 

Allen, naked, lays on the bed. He turns off the light.


                                      74.
             SAMMY
	(V.O.)
      ...when I didnt know what else to 
      do.

The sailor climbs on top of Allen, turns it back on.

EXT. RIVERSIDE PARK - NIGHT 

David LUNGES for Lucien and Lucien throws him off, spins 
away.

He pulls out his Boy Scout knife.

David stares at Lucien, stunned.

INT. CRAPPY HOTEL, 42ND STREET - NIGHT 

Allen turns to face the sailor. Looks him in the eye.

             SAMMY
	(V.O.)
      Wake, melancholy mother. Wake and 
      weep.

Allen reaches to kiss the sailor. 

EXT. RIVERSIDE PARK - NIGHT 

Lucien STABS David, plunges the blade into his chest.

INT. CRAPPY HOTEL, 42ND STREET - NIGHT 

The sailor enters Allen. 

INT. BILLS APARTMENT - NIGHT

Bill drifts backwards, into the high.

             SAMMY
	(V.O.)
      Quench within thy burning bed, thy 
      fiery tears.

EXT. RIVERSIDE PARK - NIGHT 

David looks up from his chest. Blood pumps from the gash. 

David, clutching his shirt, his chest...


                                      75.
INT. 118TH STREET APARTMENT - NIGHT

             SAMMY
	(V.O.)
      And let thy loud heart keep--

The record runs out, the stylus scratches. Jack, trembling.

             EDIE
      What is that?

             JACK
      Its Shelleys elegy for Keats.

             EDIE
      Whats that mean?

             JACK
      It means hes dead.

                             FADE TO BLACK.

INT. GROUP SHOWERS, SEMINARY - THE MORNING AFTER

FADE UP ON: Allen, alone in the shower. Hes completely 
blank, eyes on the tile. 

Realizing what he did the night before and how it felt so 
natural -- now he knows exactly who he is. 

INT. DORM HALLWAY - DAY

Allen steps out in a bathrobe, to see a POLICEMAN and a 
DETECTIVE whispering outside Luciens room. 

             POLICEMAN
      He didnt come back here 
      afterwards. Nobody on the floor 
      saw.

They stare at Allen, studying him. Other students whisper.

             POLICEMAN
      We have two in custody. Were still 
      getting names.

Allen  makes his way down the hall. Custody? What happened to 
Lucien?

             DETECTIVE
      So what do we know about this Carr 
      kid? Did we have any friends? Were 
      gonna have to speak to all of them.


                                      76.
Allen looks down and races to the hallway phone.

INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

Allen dials a number. Nervous. Edie picks up.

             ALLEN
      Edie? Is Jack there?

             EDIE
	(O.S.)
      You don't know?

             ALLEN
      Know what?

INT. 118TH STREET APARTMENT - DAY

Edie searches for the words.

             EDIE
      The police took him down to the 
      Tombs. As an accessory. Bill too. 

             ALLEN
	(O.S.)
      What happened?

Edie shocked, unable to speak.

                                  CUT TO:

INT. THE TOMBS - DAY

The BLARE of a prison horn. A guard opens a heavy gate and 
Allen walks onto the hall of cells. Its a long, dank walk. 

Allen spots Lucien in a small unremarkable cell, behind bars, 
reading. Allen cant believe hes here.

Lucien sits up from his cot and rushes to the bars.

             LUCIEN
      Allen, thank God.

Allens skeptical face makes Lucien change tactics.

             ALLEN
      How could you?

             LUCIEN
      He wanted to hurt me, I had no 
      choice.


                                      77.
             ALLEN
      You could have run. Called the 
      police.

Lucien looks Allen fiercely in the eye.

             LUCIEN
      Listen. Somehow he found me at the 
      Marine Hall. 

Allen looks away, realizing he is potentially complicit.

             LUCIEN
      He said no matter where I went, he 
      would follow. When I confronted 
      him, he exploded. I had to defend 
      myself. He wouldnt stop. 

             ALLEN
      But how did Jack and Bill get roped 
      into this?

                                  CUT TO:

EXT. HARLEM SIDEWALK - DAWN

Lucien drops the bloody Boy Scout knife down a grate. Jack 
stands guard.

             LUCIEN
	(O.S.)
      I went to Jack first. He told me to 
      get rid of the knife. To forget the 
      whole thing. 

They hear footsteps and turn. A black woman watches them 
suspiciously.

INT. BILLS APARTMENT - DAY

             LUCIEN
	(O.S.)
      But then I went to Bill. He told me 
      to get a lawyer.

Bill fingering Davids pack of Lucky Strikes in his bathroom. 
Davids blood on his hand. 

             LUCIEN
	(O.S.)
      To say it was an act of self-
      defense.

Lucien watches Bill light one of the bloody cigarettes and 
inhale. The last flare of his friend.


                                      78.
Bill flushes the rest of the pack down the toilet.

INT. TOMBS - DAY

Lucien, desperate, at the bars of his cell. 

             LUCIEN
      The D.A. is asking for my 
      deposition. In writing.

Allen shakes his head, theres no way hes going to do this.

             LUCIEN
        (pleading)
      We both know I cant do it. I dont 
      know what Im going to do. Im 
      going to be stuck in here for the 
      rest of my life!

Allen, still unsure. Lucien slides his hand down the bars 
until it touches Allens. Pleads seductively.

             LUCIEN
      Please dont leave me here.

The BUZZER goes off. Visiting time is over. The prison guard 
heads towards the cell. Allen makes a fateful choice.

             ALLEN
      Ill do it.

Lucien, smiling. Leans in, whispers.

             LUCIEN
      Were going to say it was an honor 
      slaying.

Off Allens confused face...

INT. LIBRARY, MAIN HALL - DAY

A finger traces down a legal index to the definition of the 
phrase: "Honor Slaying."

             ALLEN
	(V.O.)
      "Related to a lethal attack 
      committed when the accused is 
      defending himself against a known 
      homosexual."


OTHER students around Allen gossip and steal glances at him as he reads to himself from the index. The murderers 
friend.

                                      79.

             ALLEN
	(V.O.)
      "If the accused is heterosexual, he 
      shall be pardoned. But if the 
      accused is homosexual, the charge 
      of murder in the first degree..." 

Allens attention falls to the final words:

SHALL STAND.

INT. POLICE OFFICE - DAY

Jack, in handcuffs, on the phone. PHOTOGRAPHERS, JOURNALISTS 
outside, clamoring for Jack to look their way. A murder with  
Columbia University students, this is big news.

             JACK
      Dad. Its five thousand dollars for 
      bail. I know its a lot--

A flash bulb FIRES. Journalists cat-calling for Jacks 
attention.

             JACKS FATHER
	(O.S.)
      No Kerouac was ever wrapped up in a 
      murder! Go to hell.

The line goes dead. Jack has run out of options. More 
flashbulbs EXPLODE. More screaming for his attention. Jack 
whips around.

             JACK
      Would you all just SHUT THE HELL 
      UP?!

INT. LUCIEN CARR'S DORM ROOM - DAY

Marion Carr taking down Luciens dorm room, packing her sons 
belongings into the same suitcase he tried to run away with 
before. 

             MARION CARR
      You must understand David has been 
      following him for years.

Allen, smoking nervously from Luciens bed, watching all 
traces of Lucien being torn down.


                                      80.
             MARION CARR
      When Lucien went to Bowdoin, David 
      appeared out of thin air. So I sent 
      Lu to Chicago.

Allen registers the reference from Luciens conversation with 
the Dean, a dim clue. Marion goes back to packing. 

             MARION CARR
      Surprise, David turned up there 
      too. Then, when Lucien wanted to go 
      to Mexico, guess who had a car 
      idling in the driveway? 

             ALLEN
      But he didnt have to go with him.

             MARION CARR
      He spun a web to ensnare my son. 
      Thats why I brought him here. A 
      lot of good that did.

Marion finds Luciens cravat, quickly folds it, hides it in 
the suitcase. Allen notices. 

             ALLEN
      What happened in Chicago?

Marion stops packing. Thinks. She settles on the bed, charms 
Allen with a smile. 

             MARION CARR
      Thank God Lu has you in his life. 
      He talks about you all the time.

She leans over and slips the cigarette from Allens hands 
into her own. Inhales seductively.

             MARION CARR
      You know what Allen? He calls you 
      his guardian angel.

             ALLEN
      Thats what he called David.

She exhales, her face falls. Leans in threateningly.

             MARION CARR
      That man ruined my son. You're 
      going to help me keep what's left 
      of him.


                                      81.
INT. BURROUGHSS APARTMENT (69 BEDFORD) - NIGHT

The zip of a suitcase. Bill, undoing his den, packing away 
clothes, books. Hes also leaving town. Allens come for 
answers - from the only person who knew the real David. 

             BILL
      Contrary to reports, prison is not 
      a tonic for the spirit.

We are now realizing its the end of a chapter for all of 
them. 

             BILL
      All the district attorney cared 
      about was if David was queer.

Allen gulps. The heart of the issue, thrust into the light.

             ALLEN
      And what did you tell them?

Bill sees the box of morphine from his night with Norman. He 
decides to take it with him, hides it under a pile of shirts.

             BILL
      I said yes.

             ALLEN
      Did David do something Lu in 
      Chicago?

             BILL
      Christ Allen, please dont get 
      involved.

             ALLEN
      I have to be. Im helping him write 
      his defense.

Bill paces, then turns to face Allen.

             BILL
      David was my friend. But hes dead. 
      And did Lucien tell you how he 
      died?

Allen shakes his head. He has no idea.

                                  CUT TO:


                                      82.
EXT. RIVERSIDE PARK - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

The moment right after Lucien stabbed David. What we have not 
seen yet. The story continues.

David trembles on the ground, bleeding from the knife would. 
Lucien stands above, realizing what just happened. 

Car headlamps swipe across Luciens face. Terrified, Lucien 
scans the park for witnesses.

             BILL
	(O.S.)
      He might not have wanted you to 
      know, Allen. He tied David up. 

Lucien DRAGS Davids body from the park under a railing to 
the shoreline. 

He unties his shoes, LASHES Davids hands together with the 
shoelaces. Ties them tight. 

David groans and gurgles blood. Still very much ALIVE.

Lucien rustles through Davids pockets -- pulls out anything 
side. He tosses Davids pack of Lucky Strike cigarettes, now 
speckled with blood - to the sand.

Lucien collects stones from the riverbank, STUFFS them into 
Davids pockets.

             BILL
	(O.S.)
      He put stones in his pockets to 
      weigh him down.

Lucien panics, looks around. He takes off his Merchant Marine 
clothes. Fully naked, he drags a bound David into the dark 
waters of the Hudson River. 

David moans and struggles but is no match for Lucien.

             BILL
	(O.S.)
      And dragged him into the Hudson 
      River.

             ALLEN
	(O.S.)
      What?!

             BILL
	(O.S.)
      David was alive, Allen, until 
      Lucien made him drown.

The sound of a door slamming open brings us...

                              BACK TO SCENE


INT. BILLS APARTMENT - NIGHT
MR. BURROUGHS (60s, patrician, wealthy), Bills father enters 
his sons apartment, causing Bill to stop telling the story. 
Mr. Burroughs eyes Allen suspiciously. 

                                      83.

             MR. BURROUGHS 
      Who are you? Is he part of this 
      business.

             BILL
      Leave him alone, Dad.

             MR. BURROUGHS
      I paid your bail. Dont talk to me 
      like that.

Bill looks down, obedient. The rebel silenced by his father.

             BILL
      Yes, sir.

             MR. BURROUGHS
      The car leaves in five minutes.

As Mr. Burroughs exits, Bill furiously SLAMS his suitcase 
closed. 

             BILL
      The libertine circle has come to an 
      end.

Allen looks at Bill, lost at what to do next. Bill leans in 
close.

             BILL
      Go back to the beginning.

THE RED LINE LEADS US, ONCE MORE, DOWN THE SUBWAY MAP FROM 
COLUMBIA...

TO THE EDGE OF THE WORLD. WHERE IT ALL STARTED.

INT. BATHROOM, DAVIDS APARTMENT (48 MORTON) - DAY

The window bangs open. Allen climbs into Davids apartment 
from the fire-escape. 

He opens the door to the living room. Sunlight filtering into 
a dusty, silent apartment. 


                                      84.
INT. DAVIDS APARTMENT (48 MORTON) - DAY

It is eerie. The place of someone who just left the world. 
Allen looks around, unsure what he's looking for.

His eyes fall on the bookshelves. Memories flood back, 
raveling and unraveling.

                              FLASHCUT TO:

INT. DAVIDS APARTMENT (48 MORTON) - DAY

Books LEAP into Bills hands and he places them back on the 
shelves. 

Allen UNSUTURES the pages of books, returning back to their 
original condition.

Lucien TAP nails out of the wall handing the pages back to 
Allen.

Allen scouring his memories, just like when he wrote his poem 
earlier.

Time runs in reverse.

                              BACK TO SCENE

INT. DAVIDS APARTMENT (48 MORTON) - DAY

Allen searches through the steamer trunk of the apartment. 
Nothing. He ruffles through the console table. Again nothing.

He notices Davids SUITCASE. The one David packed before 
planning on leaving by boat with Lucien.

Allen opens it. He digs through it, searching for some clue, 
any clue -- something to shed light on the past.

He pulls out a pile of clothes and underneath them...a book.

Its a copy of Yeats A VISION, covered in notes. Its 
Davids.

Its the same edition of the copy that Lucien showed Allen in 
his room.

                              FLASHCUT TO:


                                      85.
INT. DAVIDS APARTMENT (48 MORTON) - NIGHT

Time shifts into reverse -- we realize this Allens mind at 
work: rummaging for details, clues, snatches of life.

We see the first night Allen met David -- David circling his 
finger around his wineglass, his speech about life as a 
circle,slipping through time...

                              FLASHCUT TO:

INT. DAVIDS APARTMENT (48 MORTON) - DAY

Allen opening the book to find the legend that Lucien once 
showed him, the picture of Yeatss WHEEL. 

A stack of PAPERS fall from the book. Allen rifles through 
them.

And finds a faded pink hospital ADMIT form. 

Cook County Hospital, Chicago. March 1943.

He scans down the page: Carr, Lucien. Suicide Attempt. Gas 
Inhalation. Admitting Person: D. Kammerer. 

At the bottom, the form reads Next of Kin. 

Beside is the name: David Kammerer.

Below, Allen sees POSTCARDS, PHOTOS. Photos of the beach, of 
Lucien and David, reclining together. Its their trip to 
Mexico.

In photo, the two of them, posing for the camera together. 
Smiling. Looking very much like a couple in love. 

Luciens signature red CRAVAT hangs around David's neck. 

On the backside, written by hand is:

             LUCIEN
	(V.O.)
      The perfect day.

Allen, shocked. The puzzle pieces have fallen into place.

                                  CUT TO:

INT. HALLWAY, GREYSTONE - DAY

INSERT: A photo of Lucien in The New York Times.


                                      86.
The headline: STUDENT IS SILENT ON SLAYING FRIEND. HELD 
WITHOUT BAIL. AWAITING DEPOSITION.

The sound of footsteps.

Allen looks over the article. Hes on a bench in the hallway 
of an old sanitarium. 

His mother, Naomi, approaches, tentatively. The first time 
they have seen each other since she was taken from home. 

Both of them scared to make the first move towards re-
connection. 

Naomi steps towards her son, takes his face in her hands. 
Allen melts in her arms. 

EXT. GARDEN, GREYSTONE - DAY

Allen and Naomi, in the courtyard of the hospital. Patients 
being led through the sanitariums gardens by nurses behind. 

Naomi, looks remarkably more calm then the last time Allen 
saw her.

             NAOMI
      He would leave me alone in the 
      house. I was going to die there.

             ALLEN
      No, Mom. Thats not true.

             NAOMI
      Yeah, I know it. 

Naomi sinks inside herself, dark thoughts returning. 

             ALLEN
      Mom, stop.

             NAOMI
      Hey, Im okay now. Im your mother. 
      And Im okay.

She notices the bags under his eyes. His weary face.

             NAOMI
      But youre not.

Allen, a kid out of his league. 


                                      87.
             ALLEN
      Im in over my head. Someone I know 
      killed a man. And I dont know what 
      to do. He wants my help. And I 
      dont know if I should give it to 
      him. I dont know if its right. 
      Its just a mess.

             NAOMI
      Let him go. Dont help him.

             ALLEN
      I cant, mom. Hes my best friend.

             NAOMI
      Listen to me.

Naomi pulls her son closer. With more strength than she has 
displayed in years.

             NAOMI
      The most important thing your 
      father ever did was fail me.
        (beat)
      You understand?

Allen, realizing what he has to do.

INT. DORMROOM - NIGHT

Late night. Allen, back at the typewriter where he wrote the 
poem for Lucien. 

He inserts a blank page. The task before him feels huge. 

The events of the night in question -- the night of Davids 
murder -- ravels and unravels in his minds eye.

David, stabbed, gasping at Lucien with horror. The knife 
being pulled back, the wound closing back up.

                              FLASHCUT TO:

David, reaching for Lucien, in reverse, Lucien walking back 
to David, ending in an embrace.

                              FLASHCUT TO:

             ALLEN
	(V.O.)
      He loved you. And the truth is, 
      once--

                                      88.
Allen turns over the old PHOTOGRAPH of David and Lucien 
together from Davids apartment. The Perfect Day.

             ALLEN
	(V.O.)
      You loved him back. 

                              FLASHCUT TO:

EXT. RIVERSIDE PARK - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

Time now runs forward, to the inevitable. We watch Lucien and 
David walking once more of the night of the murder. But this 
time we hear their argument. Lucien, drunk, tosses his flask 
into the bushes. David follows him, desperate.

             DAVID
      Lets get out of the city. Anywhere 
      you want. Ive saved up. 

             ALLEN
	(V.O.)
      But this secret ate away at you. 

             LUCIEN
      I was just a kid, you dragged me 
      into your perverted mess!

             ALLEN
	(V.O.)
      So in Chicago, you tried to kill 
      yourself.

             DAVID
      How can you say that? You know 
      thats not true.

Lucien stops short. Stares hard at David.

             DAVID
      I will never give up on us.

             ALLEN
	(V.O.)
      He rescued you. He saved your life.

             LUCIEN 
      Youre pathetic.

Lucien walks on, but David lunges for him. They struggle. 

Lucien throws David off, spins free from his grasp, pulls out 
his Boy Scout knife from his pocket. 

The two men face each other. 


                                      89.
             ALLEN
	(V.O.)
      You needed him as much as he needed 
      you.

The bare blade FLASHES between them. David, looking at the 
knife, shocked that their relationship has come to this. He 
looks back up at Lucien. 

             DAVID
      Now I know how you felt.

             LUCIEN
      When?

             DAVID
      When you wanted to die. 

David takes a step, closing the gap between him and the 
knife. Daring Lucien to strike.

             DAVID
      Do it.

Lucien moves forward. The gap narrows. Just inches away from 
each other.

David steps forward onto the blade. Lucien does not back off. 
David gasps, notices the knife deep in his chest to the hilt.

Blood pumps from the gash.

Lucien frees the knife. Then pulls back and STABS David a 
second time. With malice. 

And again. Plunges the blade into his chest. He grinds the 
knife into David even further..

             DAVID
      Oh my god...

David DROPS, clutching his shirt, his life pulsing from his 
chest. 

                              FLASHCUT TO:

Out in the Hudson River, Lucien cradles Davids dying body in

The opening shot of the film.

             ALLEN
	(V.O.)
      And if you try to let them go... 

Davids eyes CLOSE. Lucien releases David out into the 
current.

             ALLEN
	(V.O.)
      ...they only circle back and return 
      to you. 

David sinks into the depths of the Hudson, becoming just a 
shadow then disappearing altogether.

             ALLEN

      They become part of who you are.

INT. THE TOMBS - DAY

From his cell, Lucien Carr finishes reading Allens 
DEPOSITION. 

             LUCIEN
      Or they destroy you.

We have returned to the opening scene of the movie. Lucien 
crumples the paper in his hand.

             LUCIEN
      You cant show this to anyone.

Allen stares at Lucien defiantly through the bars.

             ALLEN
      Then tell the truth, Lu.

             LUCIEN
      You werent even there. Its your 
      truth. Its fiction.


                                      91.
Allen grabs for the manuscript. Lucien pulls it out of reach.

             LUCIEN
      You wanted him gone too. You sent 
      him to me.

Allen SNATCHES the manuscript -- its a tug of war through 
the bars.

             LUCIEN
	(CONTD)
      Please. You'll kill me with that.

Allen yanks the paper from Luciens grip. He heads towards 
the exit of the prison. Desperate, Lucien calls out after 
him.

             LUCIEN
      Allen! No! DON'T!

An alarm HAMMERS through the prison, sending us to...

INT. DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICE - DAY

The New York Citys District Attorneys SECRETARY at her 
reception desk. Allen enters the room, his deposition in 
hand. He is visibly nervous as he approaches the desk.

             ALLEN
      Allen Ginsberg.

             SECRETARY
      He'll be with you in a minute. 
      Please, have a seat.

Allen waits, glances at the deposition in his lap. The title 
reads, The Night in Question.

From his prison bed, Lucien stares down the cellblock, 
hopeless. His eyes alight on his sheets.

of his decision crushes him...

INT. JAIL - DAY

...Lucien fashions a noose around his neck. He ties the sheet 
to one of the cell bars. We glide past him back to...

INT. DISTRICTS ATTORNEYS OFFICE - DAY

...Allen spies the shadow of the District Attorney behind 
frosted glass of his office...

INT. JAIL - DAY

...the circling suddenly STOPS at Lucien as the knot on the 
noose catches. He is hanging, choking, desperate to die and 
yet fighting for life. 

But the knot on the cell bars releases. Lucien FALLS to the 
ground. 

Alive. 

INT. DISTRICTS ATTORNEYS OFFICE - DAY

The secretary hangs up the phone.

             SECRETARY
      Mr. Ginsberg. He's ready for you.

She looks at the chair. No one is there.

             SECRETARY
      Mr. Ginsberg?

The sound of the door closing. Allen is gone. 

             MALE VOICE
	(O.S.)
      How did you expect us to react to 
      this?


                                      93.
INT. COLUMBIA DEANS OFFICE - DAY

Allens manuscript HITS the Deans desk. 

The depositions title page now reads The Night in Question 
by Allen Ginsberg. Its been refashioned into a novella.

Allen sits in the same chair where Lucien was reprimanded. 
Professor Steeves sits silently beside the Dean at his desk.

             DEAN
      No, please tell me. Professor 
      Steeves says you submitted it as 
      your final.

Allen, nervous in the chair.

             DEAN
      Well, then, let me tell you. It is 
      smutty and absurd. 

             ALLEN
      But you finished it.

The Dean loses his patience.

             DEAN
      Youve taken incompletes in two 
      classes. And you are already on 
      academic probation. There are rules 
      you agreed to upon admittance into 
      this university. And you have 
      managed to break and keep breaking 
      them. You dont seem to have much 
      respect for this institution. So 
      you may either retract this fiction 
      as your final. Or you may choose to 
      be expelled. What will it be?

Professor Steeves eyes Allen.

             ALLEN
      Fine.

Allen stands, making his decision.

             ALLEN
      Consider me expelled.

Allen reaches for his manuscript. The Dean SLIDES it out of 
reach.

             DEAN
      This remains with us. 


                                      94.
Professor Steeves keeps a close eye on Allen as he leaves the 
office.

INT. GINSBERG HOME - DAY

Back in the Ginsberg residence, but the house is quiet now, 
peaceful. No Naomi. The radio playing softly in the living 
room. Louis jotting down verse on the back of the mail. 

Allen, shirt untucked, composing a poem on the back of a 
bill. 

They both reach for their cigarettes at the same time. 

Louis looks at Allen writing. A mirror between father and 
son. A moment of warm appreciation. 

Louis hands Allen a package from the mail pile.

             LOUIS
      This came for you today.

The package is from Columbia University. Allen opens it, 
mystified as to what it might be.

Its his manuscript. 

On it, a note: "Walt Jr.: Keep this, Keep Going. - Professor 
Steeves." 

The music on the radio suddenly stops for a news broadcast.

             RADIO ANNOUNCER
	(V.O.)
      This is Bill OConnell reporting 
      from Paris and these are the sounds 
      of liberation.

Over the radio comes the sound of a ROARING CELEBRATION.

             RADIO ANNOUNCER
	(V.O.)
      Crowds have assembled in the 
      streets. 

Allen takes in the historic news. He looks at his father. The 
world, forever changed.

             RADIO ANNOUNCER
	(V.O.)
      This is the end of a long darkness. 
      France and Europe are finally free.

Crowds ERUPT in whistles and cheers. Allen takes it in. The 
moment Lucien had dreamed of.


                                      95.
The Mills Brothers You Always Hurt The One You Love starts 
to play.

EXT. RIVERSIDE PARK - DAY

Sun streaming on Allen, standing at the bank of the Hudson 
River, at the place where David died. 

             ALLEN
	(V.O.)
      Another lover hits the universe.

But the night here has passed, a new day begun. Its now 
pastoral, shimmering. Strolling couples, families walk by. 

Allen closes his eyes.

             ALLEN
	(V.O.)
      The circle is broken.

INT. WEST END BAR - DAY

A raucous crowd now fills the boys old haunt. Soldiers, New 
Yorkers of all kinds, pouring champagne, toasting the end of 
the Second World War. 

             ALLEN
	(V.O.)
      But with death comes rebirth.

The camera searches through the crowd to find Allen smoking 
in a banquette towards the rear of the bar, dressed-down, 
scruffy - a hint of the man he will soon become. 

He is joyous, writing in his journal. 

             ALLEN
	(V.O.)
      And like all lovers and sad people

The camera then pans past Allen, up and across the old 
college photos on the wall. 

We find a framed newspaper article on the Columbias football 
teams latest victory. 

In the corner of the article, we see a familiar face.

As we move closer, we can read the edge of the headline 
reads: HONOR SLAYING. 

The face belongs to Lucien Carr, staring down, frozen in 
time. 

Lucien is now on the wall. 


             ALLEN	(V.O.)
      I am a poet.

                                      96.

                              CUT TO BLACK.

The following TEXT CARDS fade up on screen. 

FIRST CARD:

Portraying David Kammerer as a homosexual predator, Lucien 
Carr pled guilty to first degree manslaughter. He served 18 
months in a reformatory. 

He worked as an editor at United Press International, where 
he remained until his death in 2005.

He married twice and had three children.

SECOND CARD:

Edie Parkers family bailed out Jack Kerouac, on the 
condition they marry and move to Michigan.

Craving friends in New York, he annulled his marriage and 
began a journey that would inspire his novel On the Road.

THIRD CARD:

William Burroughs left his family to pursue a criminal life 
in New York that he documented in his novels Junkie and Naked 
Lunch. He co-wrote his first novel with Jack, a novel based 
on David Kammerer's murder. 

It was kept from publication for over sixty years.

FOURTH CARD:

After his expulsion from Columbia University in 1945, Allen 
Ginsberg became one of the most awarded poets in American 
history. 

He dedicated his first published collection Howl and Other 
Poems to Lucien Carr.


In response, Lucien asked that his name be withdrawn from all further editions.

                             FADE TO BLACK.

                                      97.
