FADE IN:
EXT. RUSSIA - CHECHEN REPUBLIC - GROZNY - AFTERNOON

LIGHTNING illuminates undulating brain-like clouds.

SUPER: Chechen Republic

SUPER: Somewhere outside Grozny

INT. GROZNY - REBEL HIDEOUT

A crack in the ceiling reveals the dark, tortured sky.  
LIGHTNING flashes like the glint in a velociraptors eye.

It frightens young MOVLADI, but a tombstone voice jolts 
Movladi from his trance.

             ISA 
      Movladi!

ISA is a large, smile-less man.

One of the fatigue-dressed, bearded rebels congregated around 
a cable spool-table with a map of Russia for a tablecloth. 
AKHMED, their leader, wears a fedora over his bandana.  

He scribbles a NOTE of great importance.

             ISA
      Come here, boy.

Movladi reacts to sudden EXPLOSIONS OF THUNDER and LIGHTNING.  

RAIN leaks through the battered roof.

The others push Movladi around and tussle his hair playfully.  
But Movladi pushes back.  He wants to be treated like a man.

EXT. REBEL HIDEOUT

The rain drizzles to a stop.

Antsy storm clouds reflected in a muddy pool.  Water warts 
rise from the puddle, pulling like taffy until the freed 
drops are drawn into the air by an unseen force.  Its 
DRIZZLING UPSIDEDOWN.

INT. REBEL HIDEOUT

Akhmed stuffs the ROLLED NOTE into the bread.  His intense 
eyes gaze at Movladi.

Movladis bravado fades.  He is a child again.

But Akhmed grins wide.  Everyone laughs.  They mess Movaldis 
hair.  This time, Movladi doesnt mind and smiles.  They 
speak in Chechen with SUBTITLES.

             AKHMED
      Moscow plans an invasion.  Today, 
      tomorrow -- soon.  Now take this to 
      Havaa.  She will know what to do.

Movladi nods.  Takes the bread.  Follows ISA to the door.

Akhmed grips the shoulder of the soldier next to him.  In the 
background, Movladi and Isa open the door...

             AKHMED
      Use three crates for...

... but Movladi and Isa are VIOLENTLY SUCKED out of view.

... which Akhmed glimpses in his periphery.

The startled Akhmed jumps up.  The others catch on.  They 
race to the doorway.

EXT. REBEL HIDEOUT

Hapless puppets, MOVLADI AND ISA STREAK into the CLOUDS.

INT. REBEL HIDEOUT

Akhmed and the others retreat, but senile walls CREAK and 
BUCKLE. RAIN GUSHES into the refuge.

Akhmed watches the SHREDDED ROOF SUCKED into a cosmic vacuum.

The EYEWALL OF A HURRICANE moves into view like a football 
stadium made of high, thick white clouds.  Ice crystals 
cascade like waterfall curtains.

EXT. ALASKA - A.I.R.

The canvas of blue showcases the snow-drenched Wrangell 
mountain range as it rolls out the white carpet for...

SUPER: Gakona, Alaska.

SUPER: University of Alaskas A.I.R. (Auroral Ionospheric 
Research) Facility.

The compound is highlighted by 30 acres of 180 dipole 
antennae...

INT. A.I.R. - CONTROL TOWER

... viewed from a large second story WINDOW...

... hovering above a row of monitors.

Reflected in the glass is uniformed Russian soldier, COMRADE 
RAFIK -- expressionless, pale, tall, gaunt like Lurch.

His Glock is held to the temple of Meteorologist Jerry 
Kruzich (aka KRUZ).

A long flowing curl of smoke mists the reflection.

The source of the smoke is a thick cigar, lodged in the maw 
of a stout, mid-fifties Russian, OLEG ZHIRINOVSKY.

On the LARGE WALL SCREEN MONITOR is a satellite view of the 
land-based hurricane in Chechnya.

All of the Russians speak with Russian accents.

             OLEG ZHIRINOVSKY
        (to Kruz)
      And you said it could not be done.

Oleg types on a BLACK COMPUTER embedded in a STEEL CASE  and 
cabled to a computer.  Lights blink from the black box.

Kruz catches only glimpses of the black box behind Oleg.  

             KRUZ
      Well, congradu-fuckin-lations.

             OLEG ZHIRINOVSKY
      Thank you, Meteorologist Kruzich.  
      We could not have done it without 
      your hospitality.

             KRUZ
      You want to impress me with -- how 
      many Chechen casualties?  A hundred 
      thousand?  Two hundred...?

             OLEG ZHIRINOVSKY
      You have your terrorists.  We have 
      ours.

             KRUZ
      You wiped out a whole city for a 
      handful of rebels, you sick 
      motherfucker.

             OLEG ZHIRINOVSKY
      Americans may be satisfied with 
      stepping on the toes of their foes.  
      We say, crush the head, rot the 
      body.

A bank of office phones line the tabletop on the back wall, 
tied to a spiderweb of cables.  Each phone is marked 
numerically in Russian.

COMRADE SERGEI -- noted by the WHITE STREAK in his black 
hair, attaches the last phone.

             COMRADE LURCH RAFIK
      Finished?

             COMRADE WHITE STREAK SERGEI
      Every hard line feeds into this 
      bank.

             OLEG ZHIRINOVSKY
      Excellent.

COMRADE ANDREI with a TATTOOED BALD HEAD, enters the room.

             COMRADE BALD TATTOO ANDREI
      The last of the detainees are being 
      secured.

EXT. A.I.R. - STORAGE BUILDING

COMRADE KHOSEY, a power-lifting bulldog with an EYE-PATCH and 
his AK-47, persuades a truck driver to exit his eighteen-
wheeler.

The truck driver is corralled with machinists, maintenance 
personnel, and cafeteria workers and marched into the 
building.

EXT. A.I.R. - HANGAR

A Russian soldier points his Glock to the back of a pilots 
head, forcing him out of a hangar housing a helicopter.  A 
silent mist flares from the barrel.  The pilot falls dead.

INT. A.I.R. - STORAGE BUILDING - UNDERGROUND FLOOR

ELEVATOR OPENS.  The workers file out under gunpoint.

INT. UNDERGROUND FLOOR- STORAGE ROOM

HEAVY METAL DOORS SQUEAL open.  A huddled mass of scared 
students.  The new hostages are thrown in.

But the truck driver panics and grips the door frame.

Comrade Eye-patch Andrei crushes the drivers fingers with 
the butt of his rifle, then slams it into the drivers nose.

The driver falls back, nose bleeding profusely.

             WOMAN HOSTAGE
      You broke his hand!

Andrei is unmoved.  THE DOOR SLAMS SHUT.

INT. A.I.R. - CONTROL TOWER

Oleg continues typing at the computer terminal.

             OLEG ZHIRINOVSKY
      What we do now is a necessary step 
      to correct our current free-fall 
      into worldwide chaos.

             KRUZ
      Oh, so youre heroes now.

             COMRADE LURCH RAFIK
      Shut your mouth.

             OLEG ZHIRINOVSKY
      Your country has no stomach for 
      war.  Russia too.  United Nations?  
      NATO?  All worthless... while 
      terrorists threaten the stability 
      of the great world powers.

             KRUZ
      And when youre done, who will be 
      the last world power standing?  Let 
      me guess,... fucking Russia?

             OLEG ZHIRINOVSKY
      We dont have to be the only dogs 
      in the yard, we just want to get 
      rid of the fleas.

             KRUZ
      So, today Chechnya.  Whats on the 
      menu for tomorrow?  Roast Georgia?  
      Barbecued Poland?

             OLEG ZHIRINOVSKY
      Actually... we Russians are very 
      fond of soup.

EXT. ALASKA - GLENNALLEN - WILEYS CABIN

A Manolo Blahnik high heel steps into a pool of ice water...

... as LARA MINTER, noticeably uptight and overdressed in a 
Theory-Carola business suit for an Alaskan outpost, exits her 
luxury sedan while speaking on her cell phone.

             LARA
      ... every time I need you to take 
      care of the tiniest thing, you find 
      some way to screw it up.

An older version of Lara leaves the passenger side.  Laras 
mother, IRENE, gingerly makes her way through the icy ground.

             GRANDMA IRENE
      Told you hed be late.

INT. ALASKA - SOUTHBOUND AK-1 - WILEYS RIG/CAB ONLY

WILEY -- rugged outdoors-man good looks, drives down AK-1 
with his favorite baseball cap, a thermal shirt, well-worn 
jeans, and waffle stompers.

In back, their three-year old daughter BEL rides in her car 
seat.  The bumpy ride forces her to concentrate on each 
Cheeto extraction from its package.

             WILEY
      Dont get a feather up your pretty 
      little butt, Chief.

Bels bag of Cheetos bounces out of her hands.

EXT. WILEYS CABIN

Lara paces around the rustic porch.

             LARA
      Im going to be late.  Again.

Grandma Irene strains to see through the dirt and grime on 
the window.

             LARA
      Youre such a flake.  You think 
      its charming, but it gets old.  
      Believe me.

INT. SOUTHBOUND AK-1 - WILEYS RIG/CAB ONLY

Window view of a jackknifed eighteen-wheeler in the median.  
Emergency crews are on the scene.

             WILEY
      Hey now, you dont drive through...

EXT. SOUTHBOUND AK-1

The row of trees lining the highway have been mowed down by 
the BOOMERANG-BENT SEMI.

             WILEY 
      ... 350 miles of frozen lake with 
      nitro in your hip pocket...

INT. WILEYS RIG/CAB ONLY

Wiley steers around the commotion.

             WILEY
      ... by goofing off, you know.

EXT. WILEYS CABIN

Lara's mom almost sits on the porch rocker, but...

... its dusty.  When she tries to dust it off, a disgusting 
greasy layer stains her fingers.  She grimaces.

             LARA
        (still pacing)
      Im here.  Whats your twenty?

INT. WILEYS RIG/CAB ONLY

Bel strains to view the spilled Cheetos on the floor.

             WILEY 
      Hah!  You sound like a truckers 
      wife!

EXT. WILEYS CABIN

Lara tries the door.  Its unlocked.

             LARA
      Ill get over it.

EXT. A.I.R. - ENTRY GATE

COMRADE BEARDED MIKHAIL taps the ash from his cigarette.  
The ash falls in front of a dead security guard incongruously 
crammed under the small booth desk.

INT. WILEYS CABIN

Grandma Irene and Laras reflections walk past rows of hung 
and seated framed photos of Lara along with family photos.

             GRANDMA IRENE
      Maybe he didnt get the divorce 
      papers.

Lara uses Wileys HOME PHONE.  DISPLAY reads: KRUZICH DIRECT 
LINE... dialing

INT. CONTROL TOWER

OFFICE PHONE #4 RINGS.

             COMRADE LURCH RAFIK
        (checks clipboard)
      Thats Kruzichs direct line.

Kruz watches helplessly.

Oleg reads the display as he eyes Kruzs reaction.

             OLEG ZHIRINOVSKY
      MINTER HOME.

             COMRADE LURCH RAFIK
        (checks list)
      That would be Chief Physicist Lara 
      Minter.  She is late for work.

             OLEG ZHIRINOVSKY
        (to Kruz)
      You dont run a very tight ship.

Kruzs PHONE DISPLAY goes blank.

INT. WILEYS CABIN

Lara hangs up.  Exhales frustration.

             GRANDMA IRENE
      Did you try his cell?

             LARA
      In a jammer-zone?

             GRANDMA IRENE
      That is such a pain in the ass.  
      Youd think with all your antennas, 
      you could figure out something.

             LARA
      Mom, thats exactly why its a 
      jammer zone.  We cant have any 
      interference.

Grandma Irene makes a face like she still doesnt get it.

Lara spies a familiar PHOTO ALBUM from the stack on the 
coffee table.  PICTURES of an infant-version of Bel at 
Disneyland.  Lara smiles as she pages through the memories.

             GRANDMA IRENE
      Look at her.

             LARA
      I told him she was too young.

             GRANDMA IRENE
      Nobody said he was bright.  He does 
      love his daughter though -- Ill 
      give him that.

             LARA
      She says she remembers, but I think 
      its just to make Wiley happy.

             GRANDMA IRENE
      Well, shell definitely remember 
      this trip.

LOCOMOTIVE SQUEAL followed by a WHALES BLOWHOLE EXHALE.  
Its Wileys rig.

             LARA
      Finally.

INT. WILEYS RIG/CAB ONLY

Twirls his wedding ring around his finger.  Reaches over to 
unbuckle Bel from her car seat.

             WILEY
      Daddys in big trouble, Sunshine.

             BEL
        (giggles)
      Daddys in twable.

             WILEY
      Thanks for the sympathy.

Wiley picks up her bag of Cheetos.  And breathes in a little 
confidence before stepping out.

INT. WILEYS CABIN

Wiley enters with Bel on his hip.

             WILEY
      Howdy-doody.

             BEL
      Mommy!

But Grandma makes it over there first.

             GRANDMA IRENE
      My big girl!

             WILEY
      Hi, Irene.

She kisses Bel, but Bel spreads her arms out for Lara.

             GRANDMA IRENE
      Guess she wants to hug her mother 
      first.

Lara gathers Bel in her arms.

             WILEY
      Ah, you know kids.  You probably 
      were the same way.

             GRANDMA IRENE
        (to Wiley, silently)
      Doubtful.  Mother was a bitch.

Wiley -- feigns a smile.

             LARA
      Ready for your big girl trip?

             BEL
      Disneyland!  Im going on a leetle 
      airpwane and a beeg airpwane.

Wiley stuffs the photo albums under couch cushions when he 
thinks no one is looking.

             LARA
      You are going to have so much fun 
      with Grandma.
        (to Wiley)
      Shes all packed?

 
             WILEY
     Almost.

             LARA
      Wiley...


             WILEY
      All-most.


Lara looks at her watch.

             LARA
      Youre doing it again.

             WILEY
      What?

Grandma Irene takes Bel from Lara.


             GRANDMA IRENE      Come on, Belinda.  Lets finish 
      packing.

They take Bels little rolling carry-on into the bedroom.

             LARA
      Blowing me off.

             WILEY
      Am not.

             LARA
      When you make light of everything I 
      say -- thats blowing me off.  You 
      know, every once in a while, adults 
      have serious conversations.

             WILEY
      Im game.  What do you want to talk 
      about?

Lara exhales in frustration and exits to the porch.

             WILEY
      What?

EXT. A.I.R.

THE CLOUDS crowd the sun, transforming day into night.  
Angry, RUMBLING CLOUDS wash black and purple...

INT. CONTROL TOWER

... in an intensified bizarre speed through the picture 
window.   THE BUILDING SHAKES AND RUMBLES.

             KRUZ
      What the --?

Oleg steps closer to the window.  RAIN BULLETS from a sky Uzi 
on the window startle him.

EXT. ENTRY GATE - THUNDERSTORM

Comrade Bearded Mikhail runs into the booth.

EXT. A.I.R. - EASTERN FENCE LINE

LIGHTNING FLASHES.  A Russian soldier guarding the eastern 
gate sees a meteor-like phenomenon plunge into the creek just 
outside the fence line leading to the forest through the 
DOWNPOUR.  He leaves his post to check it out.

EXT. A.I.R. - ANTENNAE ARRAY FIELD

The antennae array field is pummeled by HIGH WINDS AND RAIN.

THE BASE OF AN ANTENNA makes a METALLIC CRY as it wrenches 
free.  Dragged by the WIND.  SLAMS into other antennae.

A softball-sized BALL LIGHTNING ZIGZAGS from its black mother 
ship cloud...

INT. CONTROL TOWER

... and heads straight towards them.

             KRUZ
        (astonished)
      Thats...

The ball lightning deforms as it hits the window pane, then 
passes through like a ghost.  

             KRUZ
      ... ball lightning.

             OLEG ZHIRINOVSKY
      Ball... lightning?

It HOVERS, then ZIGZAGS around the room like a giant firefly.

ZIPS towards Oleg who ducks just in time.

Kruz scoots his rolling chair to safety.

IT PLOWS into the wall, leaving a BLACKENED, SMOKING HOLE.

The large WINDOW SHATTERS into a million fragments.  THE 
THUNDERSTORM invades the control tower.

             KRUZ
      Shit.

Oleg gazes at the storm that defiantly soaks him, his suit, 
his cigar.

EXT. WILEYS CABIN

Wiley joins Lara on the porch.  Shes watching the 
thunderstorm in the distance.

             LARA
      Her flights at two, are you sure --

             WILEY
      Melvins prepping the plane as we 
      speak.

Lara grows more preoccupied with the peculiar storm.

             WILEY
      Sorry bout the, uh... mess.  Bel 
      wanted to look at --

             LARA
      I didnt notice anything.

             WILEY
        (nodding)
      Oh.

Lara is still engrossed by the thunderstorm.

Wiley glances over.

             WILEY
      Ah, you know Alaska.  Well see all  
      four seasons inside an hour.

             LARA
        (shakes head)
      Somethings not right.

Wiley stops her from going back into the cabin.

             WILEY
      Hey, I thought... maybe we could go 
      somewhere -- nice, you know...

             LARA
      Wiley, what are you doing?

             WILEY
      I just thought... Bel with your mom 
      -- sort of gives us some time, you 
      know?  Talk...  Have one of those 
      serious conversations.

             LARA
      We have talked.  Our lawyers have 
      talked.

             WILEY
      Geezus, Lara, I know Im gone for a 
      couple-three months on the ice 
      road, but I make a years salary in 
      that time.

             LARA
      Some salary... Im, Im sorry.  
      Face it, its not the time were 
      apart thats the problem.  Its 
      when were together.  Were just 
      too... different.

             WILEY
      Cuz youre smart and Im dumb?

Lara shakes her head and walks to her car.

             WILEY
      I worked three jobs so you could 
      get your P.h.D.

Lara opens the trunk of her car and exhales.

             WILEY
      You think youre going to meet 
      another Joe as smart as you?  Not 
      going to happen.  As smart as me?  
      Okay, maybe... probably...

Lara shuts her eyes like its a delete button.  Then yanks 
out her moms suitcases.

             WILEY
      What about Bel?

             LARA
      Weve been separated for six 
      months, I really dont think 
      divorce will be that much different 
      from her point of view.
        (sighs)
      Its over, Wiley.  Its hopeless.

             WILEY
      Nothings hopeless.

Grandma Irene comes out with a packed and ready Bel, dressed 
in a Cinderella ballroom dress.

             GRANDMA IRENE
      Is this a bad time?

             LARA
      Im late.  I need to get going.

             BEL
      Look, Daddy, Im a princess.

             WILEY
      Times two.

Lara kisses Bel on the cheek.

             LARA
      You be good now.

             BEL
      I will.

             LARA
      Listen to Grandma.

             BEL
      I will.

Lara kisses Bel.  Kisses her mom.

             LARA
        (to Irene)
      Call me.

Lara drives off as they wave.

             WILEY
      And thats that.

EXT. A.I.R. - ENTRY GATE

Laras sedan pulls up to the front gate.  The thunderstorm 
has calmed into a light sprinkle.

She is surprised to find a tough looking, fatigue-dressed 
stranger (heavily bearded COMRADE MIKHAIL).

             LARA
      Wheres Reggie?

INT. CONTROL TOWER
Lara is roughly escorted into the room.  Kruz is under 
gunpoint.  The large picture window looks like a hockeys 
players smile with more spaces than glass teeth.

             LARA
      ... I know the way to my own -- 
      Kruz?

             OLEG ZHIRINOVSKY
        (all smiles)
      Chief Physicist Lara Minter.  The 
      usual plethora of diplomas and 
      awards, but most notably, the 
      designer of A.I.R.s impressive 
      antennae array.

             LARA
      What... is this?

             OLEG ZHIRINOVSKY
        (laughs, shakes hand)
      I am Oleg Zhirinovsky, former 
      G.R.U. Director of the Russian 
      Federation.

             LARA
      Former?

             KRUZ
      Theyre Neo-Soviets, Lara.  Sickle 
      and hammer shitheads looking for an 
      iron curtain encore.

Comrade Rafik SLAPS Kruz in the back of the head.

             KRUZ
      Do that again -- Ill stick that 
      hand so far up your ass, youll 
      need a manicure from your dentist.

Comrade Rafik raises his hand, but Oleg shakes his head.

             KRUZ
      They turned our array into a 
      friggin weather weapon.

             OLEG ZHIRINOVSKY
        (to Lara)
      Im sure you have many ques --

             LARA
      My heater cant generate enough 
      energy at a low enough frequency --

             KRUZ
      Done deal.  This morning.  
      Hurricane to Chechnya.  Bastards 
      gutted a whole --

             LARA
      How -- Whaa...?  No, you -- thats 
      not possible.

             OLEG ZHIRINOVSKY
      I assure you, it is.

Lara sniffs the air.  Walks towards the source.

Comrade Rafik moves to stop her, but Oleg waves him off.

             LARA
        (to Kruz)
      Smell that?

Lara examines the blackened hole in the wall.

             KRUZ
      I know.  Sulfur...

             OLEG ZHIRINOVSKY
      What does that mean?

             KRUZ
      It means, youre fucked.

EXT. ALASKA - SKY

Goofy yet lovable long time friend of Wiley, MELVIN, flies 
them on his single engine plane towards Anchorage.

INT. CESSNA

The plane descends rapidly like an elevator, then bounds up.

             GRANDMA IRENE
      Oh Lord...

             WILEY
      Dont you worry, Irene.  Melvin 
      here is the best damn pilot in 
      Gulkana.

             MELVIN
      Dats cuz ahm the only bird wit 
      wings in Gulkana.

They laugh, but Irene is not amused.

             MELVIN
      Jus sit back, relax, and Melvin 
      will get you to Anchorage safe an 
      sound.

Wiley checks on Bel.

Shes asleep.  Her rubber limbs bounce with the motion of the 
plane.  Her cheeks yellowed and pixie-dust sprinkled from 
Cheetos, drool flanking her rose-bud lips.

Wiley rubs the Cheetos powder remains, but they refuse to 
budge.

             GRANDMA IRENE
      Youll wake her.

             WILEY
        (shakes head)
      Its okay.

He wets his finger with more success.  Licks his finger for 
another try, but unintentionally tastes what he touched.

             WILEY
      Hmm.  Drool and Cheetos.

Grandma Irene frowns.

EXT. ALASKA - SKY

The Cessna rolls and zooms off.

EXT. ANTENNAE ARRAY FIELD

Lara and Kruz are led through the antennae field with Bald 
Tattoo Andrei close behind.  Hostages are busy resurrecting 
the fallen and broken antennae under gunpoint.

             LARA
        (to Kruz, silently)
      ... some kind of backlash or 
      fallout -- I dont know, Id need 
      to see their pulse algorithms --

             KRUZ
        (nods, whispers)
      We need to get to the server room.

             COMRADE BALD TATTOO ANDREI
      No talking.  Just walking.

INT. CONTROL TOWER

Oleg and Comrade Lurch Rafik observe Lara and Kruz from the 
rectangular opening that once was a window.

             OLEG ZHIRINOVSKY
      ... when I fire a gun, I dont 
      expect to be shot by the casing.

             COMRADE LURCH RAFIK
      Do you think they can fix it?

             OLEG ZHIRINOVSKY
      Ultimately, it does not matter.

EXT. CONTROL TOWER

A couple of maintenance hostages lift a window pane in front 
of Lurch Rafik and Oleg, like a car window sliding closed.

EXT. EASTERN FENCE LINE - CREEK BED

Its a fulgurite forest -- glassy stalagmites sticking out of 
the sandy creek bed.

             LARA
      Incredible.

             KRUZ
      Fulgurites.

             COMRADE BALD TATTOO ANDREI 
      So... you know what this is.

             KRUZ
      Sure, but nothing about this is 
      right.

             COMRADE BALD TATTOO ANDREI
      What is... fulguh... mites.

Lara finds a trail of fulgurite, stemming from the half-
frozen creek.

             KRUZ
      Fulgurites.  Petrified lightning.  
      Lightning fuses the sand and grit, 
      creating a captured lightning vein.  
      But these are...

She pries off a DAGGER-SIZED SHARD

SPLATTERING BLOOD on her face.

             LARA
      Shit!

The fulgurite chain leads to...

             KRUZ
      Wha...?

... a RUSSIAN SOLDIERS BODY, grotesquely twisted and fused 
to a tree by a massive fulgurite.

             LARA
      Oh God.

             COMRADE BALD TATTOO ANDREI
      He was Valery Konstantin.  Good 
      soldier.

BLOOD drains through the hollow core of the fulgurite vein 
and into the creek through the broken end.

INT. ALASKA - ANCHORAGE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

Grandma Irene and Bel are holding up a long security line 
while Wiley tries to get Lara on his cell phone.

             WILEY
      Aw, hell!

             WILEY
      Sunshine, Mommys not going to be 
      able to say goodbye.  She would if 
      she could.

Wiley kisses Bel hard, his lips engulfed in her chubby cheek.

             WILEY
      That ones from me and...

Kisses her the same way on the other cheek.  Bel giggles.

             WILEY
      ... this ones from mom, okay?

But the people in line are not overcome with warmth.

             GRANDMA IRENE
      We better go.

             WILEY
      I love you, Sunshine.  Times two.

Wiley gives her a big hug.  Kisses Irene on the cheek.

             WILEY
      Thanks, Irene.

             GRANDMA IRENE
      Were going to have a grand time.  
      As for you... good luck.

Wiley waves goodbye when TWO SUITS bookend him.  On his left, 
S.S.O. AGENT SLOAN -- a cross between an M.I.B. and a lounge 
lizard.  To his right, S.S.O. Russian Special investigator 
DMITRI GUROV -- athletic like a middleweight Mixed Martial 
Artist.

             WILEY
      Howdy-doody, boys.  I know we held 
      up the line, but...

             S.S.O. AGENT SLOAN
      You need to come with us, Mister 
      Minter.

             WILEY
      How do you know my name?

             BEL 
      Daddy!  Daddy!

Wiley looks around, flustered.

Bel and Irene are waving just past the security check.

Wiley forces a smile and a wave.

Grandma Irenes smile fades when she sees the Suits.


Sloan firmly grips Wileys upper arm to lead him away.
             WILEY
      Hold on!  Who are you guys?

             DMITRI GUROV
        (Russian accent)
      Let him say goodbye to his 
      daughter.

             WILEY
      Thank you.
        (to Bel & Irene)
      Bye, Sunshine!  Everythings all 
      right, Irene.

Bel waves, oblivious.  But Irene isnt so sure.

             S.S.O. AGENT SLOAN
      That was quick.

Surveillance photos of Lara speaking with Oleg and Kruz.  
About the same picture quality as Sasquatch photos.

Wiley peruses them carefully.

A large, impeccably-dressed man, S.S.O. Operations Director 
FITZGERALD sits at the head of the table.

             S.S.O. AGENT SLOAN
      Director Fitzgerald asked you a 
      question.

             WILEY
      Youre like C.I.A., right?

             WILEY
      And Laras in deep shit, huh?

             S.S.O. OP DIR. FITZGERALD
      The deepest kind, Im afraid.

             S.S.O. AGENT SLOAN
      We just want to know if shes the 
      shitter or the shit-on.

             WILEY
      Well, I can tell you boys right 
      now, Lara is a straight arrow.  In 
      fact, thats one of our --

      know him.  And this Russian dude...

             S.S.O. AGENT SLOAN
      Theyre both Russian.

             S.S.O. OP DIR. FITZGERALD
      Lara studied in Moscow --

             WILEY
      Yeah, but... it was a summer 
      program.  Thats all.  Shes not 
      some spy or double-agent.

             S.S.O. AGENT SLOAN
      How would you know?

             WILEY
      What do you mean, how...  Hey, 
      this guys been up my ass since --

      Agent Sloan is just doing his job.

             DMITRI GUROV
      I dont think your wife is involved 
      either -- at least, not by choice.

Worry creeps over Wileys face.

             DMITRI GUROV
      Her life is in serious danger, my 
      friend.  Did she mention a place 
      called Sura?  In Vasilsursk?

Wiley shakes his head.

             S.S.O. OP DIR. FITZGERALD
      Has she ever mentioned 
      environmental modification?

Wiley stares blankly.

             S.S.O. AGENT SLOAN
      You know, weather control?

             WILEY
        (thinks)
      Lara said that one day well be 
      able to do crazy shit like divert 
      hurricanes and...

             DMITRI GUROV
      Yes, thats it, exactly.

             WILEY
      But she said thats a long way off.

The agents share an eye-conference.

             DMITRI GUROV
      Wiley, this man -- Oleg,  tried to 
      rebuild an old Russian heater in 
      Sura.  Your wifes facility is at 
      least ten times more powerful.

             WILEY
      And you think this Oleg guy 
      hijacked it to control the weather.

             DMITRI GUROV
      Yes.

Wiley stands up, anxious, nervous, frustrated.

             WILEY
      Well, what are we doing sitting 
      around here?  We need to get Lara 
      the hell outta there before he 
      tries something.


             S.S.O. OP DIR. FITZGERALD
      We think he already did.

             S.S.O. AGENT SLOAN
      The motherfucker sent a hurricane 
      to Chechnya this morning.

             WILEY
      Ho-lee shit.

             S.S.O. OP DIR. FITZGERALD
      You can see why were concerned.  
      What would stop him from targeting 
      a major American city or the White 
      House?

             WILEY
        (sits down)
      Oh fuck.

      Exactomundo.

             WILEY
      No, I mean, ohhh fuck.  I think I 
      may have screwed up.

The agents are puzzled.

             DMITRI GUROV
      Wiley?

             WILEY
      Back there in the bathroom, I uh... 
      I didnt know what this was all 
      about.  I wanted someone to know 
      where I --

             S.S.O. OP DIR. FITZGERALD
      Mister Minter, what precisely are 
      you saying?

             WILEY
      ... or something like that.  
      Anyway, I might be here for awhile.  
      Call you soon, Chief.

      defend the compound.  Then... check 
      mate.

             S.S.O. OP DIR. FITZGERALD
      We wait.

Gurov steps off the Huey and turns around.  Sloan is joined

A SHOT is FIRED in the midst of a CLANG-CLANG in rapid

stunning the agents.

Sloan reaches into his coat for his gun, but Gurov PUSH-KICKS 
one of the agents into him first.

The other agent wraps his arms around Gurov from behind.  
Gurov steps back, squats down, and DIGS his spade into the 
AGENTS FOOT.  Spins around and SLAMS THE SHOVEL to the side 
of the agents FACE.

Spins again and strikes his shovel on the other agents KNEE.  
He crumples to the ground, leaving Sloan exposed as...

EXT. ALASKA - ANCHORAGE

The 200 foot WAVE SMASHES into Anchorages shoreline.

INT. ANCHORAGE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

Sloan and Fitzgerald run through a SHAKING and COLLAPSING 
hallway.  Ceiling panels fall.  WINDOWS BURST.  SPARKS fly.

They wrestle their way to the main terminal area.  Its 
empty.  ROARING THUNDER.

They turn to see...

... the OCEAN BURSTS through the windowed walls, FLOODING the 
terminal.  An oceanic locomotive surging towards them.

INT. ANCHORAGE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - SECURITY ROOM

Wiley and Melvin are SMASHING THE TABLE into the DOORKNOB, 
but its not easy with TREMORS throttling the room.

One clean shot POPS the DOORKNOB off.  The door opens, but a 
FLOOD CRASHES into them.

Wiley dives underwater to dig out Melvin from under the 
table.  They suck in as much air as they can, just inches 
below the ceiling.

They swim, pulling on door frames and corners.

INT. A.I.R. - CONTROL TOWER

Lara argues with Oleg when Kruz notices Olegs screen.

             LARA
      ... how can we help you with your 
      backlash problem if you wont --

             KRUZ
      Where did you say Wiley and Bel 
      were?

Lara shoves Oleg to get a better look at his screen.

             OLEG ZHIRINOVSKY
      Comrade Rafik.

             LARA
      No!  No!  You bastards!  No, God, 
      nooooo!

Lurch Rafik forcefully takes Lara out of the room, but they 
can hear her screaming down the hallway.  Eye-Patch Khosey 
pushes a gun barrel into Kruzs cheek.

On Olegs SCREEN:  A satellite visual of the accompanying 
text: TSUNAMI TARGET SUCCESSFUL: ALASKA - ANCHORAGE. 

I/E. ALASKA - ANCHORAGE

THE TSUNAMI POURS through the city streets and between the 
buildings like a giant sieve.

Children are BLASTED OFF the playground.

The man in the dark office stands at the tenth story window 
to see a WAVE that dwarfs his whole building.  The papers in 
his hand drop to the floor.

Five-inch thick lightning-like CRACKS channel through the 
city sidewalks and streets.  GAS AND WATER LINES BUST OPEN.  
Concrete and asphalt mountain ranges SURGE as the sidewalks 
and streets SHIFT AND UPROOT ten feet in the air.  Cars and 
people slide and COLLIDE into each other.  

The once serene neighborhoods GROUND LIQUEFIES becoming 
quicksand for the school bus trapped in it.  Homes are 
swallowed by the ground as the LIQUEFACTIONS RADIUS SWELLS.

The mom at an empty dinner table watches her whole world at 
an angle, riding a JITTERING DESCENT into the sludge.

Gurov has his Glock pointed at the pilot.  His Spetsnaz

      ... but weve got to go back, Sir.  
      Somethings happening in Anchorage.
        (eyes bleeding wound)
      Besides, youve been shot.

CLICK of Gurovs GLOCK silences the pilot.

The pilot focuses on flying.

INT. CESSNA

Wiley sees...

EXT. ANCHORAGE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - AIRFIELD

... the overturned freight ship, pushed into the corner of

and flood with ocean water.

Wiley pulls Melvin to the railing of the sideways ship.

             WILEY
      You okay?

Melvin coughs up sea water.

             MELVIN
      My plane...

Wiley surveys the flooded plain that was once an airfield.  
He spots the ships SAFETY BOAT hanging off the edge of the 
ship.  Melvin sees it too, but its several stories high.  
The only way there is by climbing the RAILING like a ladder.

             MELVIN
      Ah no.  I say we wait here.

             WILEY
      All right, man.  You wait here, but 
      I gotta go.  Im sure someone will 
      be by in a couple days... Or weeks.

INT. A.I.R. - STORAGE ROOM

Hostages are crowded in the dark, makeshift cell.  Kruz tries 
to comfort Lara.  She picks up a small wooden crate and 
FLINGS IT at the door.

             KRUZ
      ... you dont know for sure.  Maybe 
      Bel and Irene made it out in time.

             MAN HOSTAGE
      Were locked in underground 
      storage.  They have guns and we

      Stand on your head and shoot sparks 
      out your ass for all I care.  Just 
      shut the fuck up.

The man cowers in the dark.

             KRUZ
        (to Lara)
      What about the backlash?  Think it 
      was an anomaly?

             LARA
      Just because it didnt hit here, 
      doesnt mean it didnt hit 
      somewhere.  They keep boiling the 
      ionosphere with that kind of energy 
      and were in for unprecedented 
      geomagnetic storms, atmospheric 
      turbulence,... well lose over-the-

METAL DOOR CREAKS open.  Oleg and Lurch Rafik.

      complete our mission -- thats 
      exactly what I mean.

Lara looks down in shame.

             OLEG ZHIRINOVSKY
      We had no intention to harm 
      innocents, but certain actions are 
      necessary to fulfill prime 
      objectives.  You Americans know 
      this all too well.

Lara buries her head in Kruzs shoulder.

             KRUZ
      Were missing some people.  Our 
      pilot, Mackie and --

             LARA
      Reggie, our security guard...

Rafik whispers into Olegs ear.

             OLEG ZHIRINOVSKY
      Unfortunately, they are not 
      missing.

Gasps and wails perforate the room.

             KRUZ
      So much for cooperation.

             OLEG ZHIRINOVSKY
      The pilot and security guard posed 
      a possible threat by the nature of 
      their duties --

             LARA
      Reggie was sixty-two years old.

             KRUZ
      This is a student research lab.  
      Not Fort Knox.

      Now, Doctor Minter, -- if you would 
      accompany us...

Wiley and Melvin are in the motor boat.  Wiley lowers the

He pulls out his pocket knife.

      No, no, Wiley.  Lemme give it a go.

But Wiley cuts the last rope and they slide down a roller 
coaster towards murky depths.  Melvin screams.

SPLASH!  Wiley cant believe they made it.  But wheres...

GUNBOATS at sea try desperately to reach the port as theyre 
tossed to and fro.  One of the GUNBOATS loses control and 
hurtles into the air.  

RAIN reverses itself. 

SEA WATER is SCOOPED into the air.  Theres hardly a 
difference between the ocean above and the ocean below.  
The gunboat DRIVER sees the SHOWER PELTING him until he 
realizes that his boat is upside-down.  He CRASHES into the 
SEA.

SOLDIERS cannot close the hangar doors in time.  

A WAVE OF WATER 

BLASTS through, sending the soldiers along with planes, 
forklifts, and trucks awash.

MEN are CRUSHED between the CRATES AND VEHICLES.

THE HANGAR ROOF SPLITS AND TEARS OFF.

THE SHIPS are tossed about like toys in a bathtub.  

The AIRCRAFT on a ship BREAK loose from their CABLES.  The 
fuel-ladden aircraft BANG off each other and the hangar WALLS

The SPARKS ignite the fuel.  EXPLOSIONS on deck.  

FIRES are SUCKED into the ventilation shafts,...

      He is like a cockroach you trample 
      under foot, only to scurry away.

             COMRADE LURCH RAFIK
      The river has not been prepared as 
      an ice road.  He will scurry at the 
      bottom of the river.

Oleg crushes the photograph.

             COMRADE LURCH RAFIK
      Leave it alone.  Were running out

WHAM!  Wiley slaps Melvin.

      When a truck of this size sits on a

      time before it sinks.  And when it 
      goes, well have about two minutes 
      before we freeze to death.

They leap out of the truck.  But Melvin lands on thin ice and 
CRASHES right through it.

Melvin sinks into freezing cold water, eyes bulging.

Wiley watches Alexandr fall from the chopper.  Looks around.

On the snowbank, Gurov is sitting on a snowmobile with his 
rifle.  He waves.

Wiley smiles and waves back.

     Gurov.

             MELVIN 
      Wiley!

Wiley turns around to see Melvin on top of the sinking 
trailer, waving meekly.

             WILEY
      What are you doing on the truck?

Wiley runs towards Melvin.

             WILEY
      Jump!  Jump!

But Melvin hesitates.

             WILEY
      Jump, God-dammit!

Melvin is scared shitless after his last jump.  He closes his 
eyes, holds his nose, and...

             WILEY 
      Jump!

But by the time he jumps, the trailer has sunk so low that 
hes knee-deep in the river.  He BELLY-FLOPS.

Wiley rolls his eyes.  Dives into the water.  Drags Melvin to 
the edges of the ice to find a helping HAND... in GUROV.

RAPID THUDDING of helicopter blades.

INT. HELICOPTER

Sergei is hell bent on mowing them down as he...

EXT. MATANUSKA RIVER

... swoops.  They dive out of the way.

Sergei flies lower and lower.

Gurov shoves them down.  Leaps, slides on his back, FIRING 
HIS automatic into the belly of the CHOPPER as it FLIES by.

INT. HELICOPTER

Sergei is ripped to shreds from an upside down RAIN OF 
BULLETS, spurting rivulets of BLOOD into the ceiling.

EXT. MATANUSKA RIVER

THE HELICOPTER CRASHES into the frozen river.

Gurov stands up to check it out as Wiley and Melvin hoot and 
holler victoriously.  Wiley hugs Gurov.

             MELVIN
      I dun know who ya are an Ive 
      never kissed a man bee-fer, but --

             DMITRI GUROV
      I am Dmitri Gurov.  Wiley and I 
      are... old friends.

Their handshakes are interrupted by the RAPID SNAP AND 
CRACKLE OF ICE.  The chopper crash created huge cracks.

             MELVIN
      Uffdah!  Dun say it.

Wiley grabs Melvin by the collar and spins him around.

             WILEY
      Run!

They run like hell towards the shoreline.  They dive onto the 
snowy river bank.

The layer of ice CRACKS.  A WAVE SURGES upward in a mountain 
of water, then IMPLODES BACK into the river sending RIPPLES 
OF ICE in an increasing radius.  They are SHOWERED WITH ICE.


Melvin blows out air.  The only places on his face without 
snow are his bulging eyes and open mouth.

      Theyre safe where they are.  We

      Watch.  This is your reloading 
      handle.  Pull back and youre ready 
      to go.  Look, shoot, dont stop 
      until one of you is dead.

             LARA
      So... youre an assassin?

             WILEY
      Lara!

             LARA
        (softer)
      License to kill and all that?


             WILEY
      Hes here to get that Oleg dude.

             LARA
      I have no problem with that.

             DMITRI GUROV
      In Russia, they called me, 
      cemetery man.

             WILEY
      Thats cuz he likes shovels.

             LARA
      Does it bother you?  Taking a life?

             DMITRI GUROV
      I learned long ago that when one 
      person falls, it sends a ripple.  A 
      wife, a mother.  Son, daughter,...

             LARA
      And if the sky falls, what will be 
      the ripple then?

EXT. OUTER SPACE - IONOSPHERE

WHITE HOT BEAMS PIERCE the upside-down ocean.

A stray satellite is caught by one of the solar shafts.  It 
jerks down then up, like a swimmer tugged by an unseen shark.  
Lights go out.  Plummets and bursts into flame.

INT. INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION

From the SICK BAY WINDOW, tiny specks of light streak to 
earth as a multitude of satellites plunge to their deaths.

Below the window, a dying astronaut lies on a sick bay bed.

             MEDICAL OFFICER
      ... problem is, weve all been 
      exposed to radiation levels well 
      past our limits.

The astronauts FACE is obscured with open sores and 
blisters.

INT. CONTROL TOWER

One of the computer monitors catches Wileys attention.

On SCREEN is a four quadrant view of security cameras.

             LARA
        (frustrated)
      Without his black box, its a 
      Rubiks Cube to figure out where he 
      patched in...

On Laras SCREEN: TARGETING 760 UNITED NATIONS PLAZA, NEW 
YORK.  TRANSMISSION COMPLETE IN 27 MINUTES.

             LARA
      God.

             WILEY 
      Hey guys...

Laras fingers are flying across the keyboard.

             LARA
      Not now, Wiley.

             WILEY
      No, really, you need to see this.

Gurov goes over to Wileys monitor.

             LARA
      Dammit!  I cant override it!

On Wileys SCREEN:  Leonid, Ivan, and Rafik.

             DMITRI GUROV
      Tvoyu mat!

             LARA
      What?  What?

Wiley rolls the cursor over a quadrant: CONTROL BUILDING, 
FIRST FLOOR, HALL E, CAMERA 6.

             WILEY
      Its Olegs men.  Theyre coming.

             DMITRI GUROV
      Lara, can you stop the 
      transmission?

             LARA
      Can you pull a bullet back in its 
      barrel once its been fired?
        (types)
      If we can stop it from completing 
      its cycle, it may terminate in the 
      ionosphere before re-entry.  But 
      thats a lot of built-up energy. 

             DMITRI GUROV
      You have to try.  Wiley, lets buy 
      Lara some time.

Wiley is nervous, but nods yes.

             LARA
        (to Wiley)
      Wait.

Lara moves awkwardly toward Wiley.  Places her hand on his 
face.

             LARA
        (smiles weakly)
      Dont flake out on me.

Wiley grins and takes off with Gurov.

Leaning against Laras computer station is Gurovs AN-94.

INT. STORAGE ROOM

The hostages are losing hope.

             MAN HOSTAGE

INT. CONTROL BUILDING - STAIRWELL

Gurov looks ready for the morgue.  He coughs violently.

             WILEY
      Youre not going to die on me, 
      right?


             DMITRI GUROV      Yes.
        (smiles)
      But not yet.

             WILEY
      Do you have to do that?

             DMITRI GUROV
        (coughs)
      Where is the A.N.-94?

             WILEY
      Shit!... Im sorry, I must of...

Gurov slaps his GLOCK on Wileys chest.

             DMITRI GUROV
      Lovers make sloppy soldiers.

Wiley smiles sheepishly.

             DMITRI GUROV
    Ready?

             WILEY
      No.

Gurov opens the door into the hallway.

INT. CONTROL BUILDING - HALLWAY

Lurch Rafik, Ivan, and Leonid walk down the hallway.

CLICK-CLACK of shoes on tile floor behind them.

They turn around.  Gurov stands like High Noon.

             COMRADE LURCH RAFIK
      So Mikhail was right.  It is you.

But Gurov immediately sidesteps into a CLASSROOM.

Puzzling the three comrades.

BAM! BAM! BAM!  A bullet pierces Ivan from behind.

They turn around.

Wiley is on the floor, FIRING AWAY.

Leonid is HIT in the ARM.  Ivan eats THREE MORE BULLETS.

Rafik uses the injured Leonid as a shield.  Leonid BOUNCES in 
an epileptic seizure from the BULLETS.

Rafik tosses twitching Leonid when he reaches the classroom.

Wiley gets up.

INT. CONTROL BUILDING - CLASSROOM

Looks empty.  Rows of seats with partial desktops.  Lab 
tables with bar stools.  White-boards on wheels.

             COMRADE LURCH RAFIK
      Dmitri -- this is so unlike you.  
      Why do you hide?

Rafik spots the trail of blood on the floor.

INT. CONTROL BUILDING - HALLWAY

Wiley has the GLOCK poised.  Kicks Ivan.  No movement.

INT. CLASSROOM

The blood trail leads to a supply cabinet unit.

Rafik smirks and slowly, silently, aims his AK-47.

Dull CLICK.  The TRIGGER wont budge.

Rafik looks at his rifle.  TWO BULLET HOLES smolder in it.

WHEELS ROLLING.

Rafik turns.

Gurov sails towards him on the supply ledge of a rolling 
white-board.  He leaps.

They tumble to the floor.

INT. CLASSROOM HALLWAY

Foamy blood oozes out of Leonids mouth and ear.

Wiley hears the RUCKUS coming from the room.

INT. CLASSROOM

Gurov ends up on the bottom, but kicks Rafik in the chest.

Rafik stumbles backward as Wiley opens the door.

Rafik SHOULDERS THE DOOR, jamming Wiley between the door and 
the door frame.  Wiley grunts, drops the gun.

Rafik backs off, causing Wiley to fall forward.  Rafik ELBOWS 
Wiley in the back of the head.  Wiley DROPS UNCONSCIOUS.

A weak Gurov pulls out his shovel from his back holster.

Rafik does the same.

             COMRADE LURCH RAFIK
      I was always better than you.

Like samurai swordsmen, they charge each other.  STRIKE, 
PARRY, BLOCK, STAB -- all a blur of CLANGING METAL until 
Gurov BANGS THE SHOVELS FACE on Rafiks forehead.  Hooks his 

SHOVEL HANDLE

around the forward KNUCKLES of Rafiks spade hand and gives 
it violent TWIST.

Rafik growls in pain.  His spade CLANGS to the floor.

Gurov raises his shovel for the finishing blow, but he sees 
SEVERAL RAFIKS in front of him.  Coughs violently.

Rafik whips out his GLOCK and FIRES SEVERAL TIMES.

Gurov flies backward.  Lays with his spade on his still 
chest.

Rafik towers over him, aims his Glock with a smirk...

... that fades.  His BULLETS are EMBEDDED in Gurovs SHOVEL.

Gurov CHOPS Rafik BETWEEN THE LEGS with his shovel.

Rafik yelps, eyes about to burst from his head.  A RED 
WATERFALL gushing from where once hung his manhood.

             DMITRI GUROV
      Dasvidania, comrade.

Rafik collapses to the ground, convulsing.

Gurov drops backward.  His spade rolls from LIFELESS HAND.

INT. CONTROL TOWER

Lara SLAPS THE COMPUTER off the desk in frustration.

             COMRADE EYE-PATCH KHOSEY 
      I like a fiery women.

Lara turns to see Khosey.  She eyes Gurovs AN-94 in her 
periphery.

INT. CLASSROOM

Wiley wakes up.  Shakes the cobwebs out.

             WILEY
      Gurov.  No...

INT. CONTROL TOWER

Khosey drops his AK-47.  Removes his coat.

             COMRADE EYE-PATCH KHOSEY
      Stalin believed in rewarding his 
      troops with the spoils of war.

Unbuckles his belt.

Lara grabs the AN-94, startling Khosey for a second.  Then 
the bastard smiles.

Lara backpedals as she takes it OFF SAFETY.  Khosey presses 
forward.  Tosses his belt and holster aside.

She FIRES.  

Khoseys eyes wide.

Shes FIRING blindly into the ceiling, the force of the gun 
jerks her like a jackhammer.  She falls to the ground.

INT. CLASSROOM

Wiley shakes Gurov.

             WILEY
      Gurov!  Not yet!  Not... aw, hell, 
      man.

Wiley cradles him in his arms.

INT. CONTROL TOWER

Khosey laughs and SLAPS THE RIFLE out of her hands.

Comes closer.

Lara inches backward until she runs into a dead-end.

He UNZIPS HIS PANTS and forces her to spread her legs.

Lara shows no fear, she is defiant.

But it only makes Khosey smile more.

Their eyes lock as Khosey UNBUTTONS HER SHIRT.

The FULGURITE SHARD from the creek bed snakes its way out of 
her coat pocket with her hand.

Impatient, Khosey RIPS HER SHIRT apart.

Lara PLUNGES the fulgurite SHARD into KHOSEYS NECK.  

Khosey reels back, blood squirting profusely from his aorta 
through the FULGURITES HOLLOW CORE, spraying the room in 
grisly SPURTS.  

Lara shields herself from the blood shower.

Khosey falls dead.

             LARA
      Cause of death: Premature 
      ejaculation.

Wiley runs into the room.

Picturesque Virginia countryside with a large barn-like 
structure.  Pigeon fanciers gaze at an empty sky.

SUPER: Carrollton, Virginia

On the roof eaves edge of the barn is a large banner that 
reads, THE 23rd ANNUAL HAMPTON ROADS PIGEON RACE.

Below the sign are barren rows of arched holes for the homing 
pigeons to enter their finish line.

Race Director ELLIOT DENBY and Co-Director GENE MILLET sit 
next to a table crowded with golden trophies of various sizes 
shadowed by a large trophy cup.

             GENE

      Cedar Crossing Georgia Joe?

      Now what other Georgia Joe do we 
      know of?

             ELLIOT
      Theres Georgia Joe from Manassas.

             GENE
      Youre right.  But Im not talking 
      about Manassas Georgia Joe, Im 
      talking about Cedar Crossing 
      Georgia Joe.

             ELLIOT
      He had the worst race smash in 
      pigeon history.  

             GENE
      Hardly a nests worth of birds 
      clocked in.  Week later, that 
      earthquake opened up San Francisco 
      like Jiffy Pop.

             ELLIOT
      Read that article the other day 
      about how homing pigeons can sense 
      the earths magnetic field?

             GENE
      You think that has something to do 
      with this?

They both ponder it as they sip their tea in tandem.


             ELLIOT & GENE      Naaaah!

A few hopefuls still search the skies for their birds.  Most 
pack up to leave.

             ELLIOT
      Well, Gene, are you gonna call it 
      or am I?

             GENE
      Youre the Race Director.

             ELLIOT
      Youre the Co-Director.

      Well, all right then.  Ill co-
      announce it with you.

             ELLIOT

      Be careful now, Cindy.

             CINDY

Cindy backs out of the screen door leading to the backyard.

Her mom raises an eyebrow at the nicked cake when...

      This is a jammer-zone.  He cant 
      operate a remote within a five-mile 
      radius.

             WILEY
      Where then?

             LARA
      The server room.  He must be hooked 
      directly to the mainframe.

Wiley grabs Lara to run.

             WILEY
      Well, lets get down there.

             LARA
      Think hell be nice and hand it 
      over?

Wiley picks up Gurovs AN-94.  Checks the cartridge.

             LARA
      I think I used all the bullets.

Wiley tosses it.

             LARA

Mikhail cheers like a bloodthirsty Viking of old.

The Marines are confused.

The clouds spiral above.  The WIND on the ground spins dirt

Mikhail wakes.  Nods and runs for the storage building.

INT. SERVER ROOM HALLWAY

Wiley and Lara sprint.

INT. CONTROL BUILDING

More blood than man, Gurov crawls down a hallway.

EXT. ENTRY GATE

THE TORNADO WHIRLS in place, its leftovers of wreckage and 
dead bodies at its feet.

Oleg has seen enough and walks away.

TIMER: 00:00:12

EXT. COURTYARD

Wiley and Lara run out of the control building, panting.

Mikhail halts, staring at them in disbelief.

             WILEY
      Aw, Geez...

             COMRADE BEARDED MIKHAIL
      Minter?  What are you...
        (looks at Wiley)
      Who are you?

             LARA
        (grabs Wileys hand)
      My husband.

Wiley looks at Lara in wonder.

             COMRADE BEARDED MIKHAIL
      The trucker?  How...?

Mikhail aims his AK-47.

Lara gasps.

Wiley steps in front of her.

             WILEY
        (eyes glued on Mikhail)
      Hey, Chief... I love you.  You know 
      that.

INT. SERVER ROOM HALLWAY

TIMER ticks down to: 00:00:00

KA-BOOM!

EXT. COURTYARD

Smoke and ash MUSHROOM out of the entry door behind them, 
KNOCKING them to the ground.

Mikhails rifle SKITTERS across the ice.

Wiley JUMPS ON Mikhail.

They wrestle in the ice and freezing puddles.

Lara grabs the AK-47.  But no clear shot.

Wiley wins the top position, but Mikhail reaches for his 
SIDEARM.

             LARA
      Wiley!

Wiley grabs Mikhails WRIST with one hand and squeezes 
Mikhails throat with his other.

             WILEY
      You get a pretty good grip chaining 
      loads on the ice road.

Wiley smashes Mikhails GUN HAND on the ground several times, 
but Mikhail wont let go.  Mikhail strains to raise the gun 
towards Wiley.

Wiley sees the PUDDLE next to them and SLAMS Mikhails GUN 
HAND into the icy pool.  

BOTH HANDS

are submerged in the frigid water with the gun.

Mikhail grits his teeth.

             WILEY
      Sometimes we have to check air 
      hoses and tighten bolts with our 
      bare hands in minus forty degrees.

MIKHAILS HAND is turning blue.

             WILEY
      Pretty cold, eh?

Mikhail yells in pain.  

He lets go of the gun.  A thousand hot needles searing his 
hand.

Wiley raises his fist in the air.

             WILEY
      Thanks for numbing my hand, 
      asshole.

SCRUNCH!  Wiley knocks out Mikhail with a haymaker.

Wiley stands up wobbly, but Lara steadies him.

             WILEY
        (still pissed at Mikhail)
      Thats right.  Im one bad ass 
      mother-trucker.

They stumble towards the debris.  Lara rubs and exhales warm 
breath on Wileys freezing hand.

             WILEY
      And thats that.

EXT. EASTERN FENCE LINE

Oleg checks his watch.  Shakes his head in disappointment.

INT. SERVER ROOM HALLWAY

The hallway leading to the server room is caved in with 
chunks of concrete.

             LARA
      Well never stop the transmission

Everyone around him looks skyward.

SUPER: New York City

SUPER: United Nations Building

The ambassador sees the greenish black CLOUDS CHURN into a 
turbulent swirl.

EXT. COURTYARD

Lara buries her head in Wileys chest.  He looks around 
aimlessly.  He spies the row of 

EIGHTEEN-WHEELERS

docked at the storage building.

             WILEY
      You trust me?

EXT. STORAGE BUILDING

Lara struggles to keep up with Wiley.

             LARA
      How are you going to destroy 180 
      antennae in three or four minutes?

             WILEY
      I just need the biggest trailer you 
      got...  Here we go.

Its big, but ancient.

             LARA
      Maybe we should get something a 
      little newer.

INT. SUPPLY TRUCK #1

Wiley tries the starter.

             WILEY
      Naw -- the newer ones have anti-
      lock brakes.

             LARA
      Thats a bad thing?

The engine wont turn over.

             WILEY
      Come on!

Still wont start.

             WILEY
      Damn.  Froze over.

EXT. STORAGE BUILDING

Wiley and Lara try starting other trucks.  Lara REVS AN 
ENGINE.

             LARA
      Got one!

Wiley helps her out of the cab.

             LARA
      I want to go with you.

             WILEY
      Too dangerous, Chief.

Lara strides over to the other side.

             LARA
      Oh no, you dont.  Youre not 
      leaving me behind again.

Wiley drives towards the antennae array field.

             LARA
      ... jackknife it?  Like... on 
      purpose?

             WILEY
      With some luck, well give it a 
      decent haircut.

EXT. COURTYARD

The eighteen-wheeler sails through the courtyard and around 
the corner of the building.  

ICE SPLASHES off the tires.

INT. SUPPLY TRUCK #2

THE ANTENNAE ARRAY FIELD

comes into view of their windshield.  THE BLUE GLOW of the 
antennae continues to form the base for the inverted cone 
shooting a CLEAR BLUE BEAM into the heavens.

             WILEY
      You strapped in tight?

Lara double-checks her seat belt.

INT. SUPPLY TRUCK #2
Wiley puts his game face on and places his hand on the gear 
shift.  But Lara covers HIS HAND WITH HERS.

             LARA
      Wiley... wait.

             WILEY
      Itll work, Chief.  Just trust --

             LARA
      This took ten years to build.  You 
      saw its power.  We could divert 
      hurricanes from reaching 
      coastlines.  Delay earthquakes in 
      time for people to...

             WILEY
      Lara... we gotta stuff the genie 
      back in the bottle.

Lara searches her soul in Wileys eyes and lets go of his 
hand.  He SHIFTS it in GEAR.

But Lara's door opens and shes yanked out of the cab...

EXT. SUPPLY TRUCK #2

... by Oleg who plants his gun nozzle in Lara's face.

             OLEG ZHIRINOVSKY
      You are not seriously going to 
      destroy your lifes work?  Im not 
      letting you ruin mine.

INT. SUPPLY TRUCK #2

Oleg checks the cab, but Wileys not there.

EXT. SUPPLY TRUCK #2

He drags Lara around with him as he searches.

             OLEG ZHIRINOVSKY
      Wiley?  We have not met, but I am 
      the man that could change your life 
      forever with one finger.

Nothing.  No sound, but Lara's rapid breathing.

             OLEG ZHIRINOVSKY
      Think of your daughter.  You can 
      have your little family -- all 
      together again.

Lara sees

WILEYS SHADOW

on the ground.  Hes on top of the trailer.  She HEAD-BUTTS 
Oleg with the back of her head.  Right on the

NOSE.

Oleg lets her go and falls back as

WILEY

leaps from the trailer.

CRASHING Oleg to the ground.

Wiley SMASHES Oleg in the face several times.

Out cold.

Wiley tosses Oleg's gun over the fence and into the CREEK.

             WILEY
      Im getting pretty good at this.

They hurry into the cab.

EXT. SUPPLY TRUCK #2

THE TRUCK TIRES

The TRUCK picks up SPEED as it enters the array field.

             LARA
      This is so crazy.

             WILEY
      Many have tried and died.

             LARA
      Youre gonna try anyway, arent 
      you?

             WILEY
      Oink, oink.

WILEYS FOOT 

FLOORS THE GAS PEDAL.

The first set of ANTENNAE BUCKLE and disappear from view.

WILEYS FOOT

stomps on the BRAKE.

He spins his 

STEERING WHEEL 

abruptly, then straightens it out just as hastily.

FOOT

still heavy on the SCREECHING BRAKE.

Wiley and Lara jitter violently.

EXT. ANTENNAE ARRAY FIELD

The eighteen-wheeler JACKKNIFES forming a boomerang that 
SKIDS across the field, MOWING DOWN rows and rows of 
antennae.

ANTENNAE SHRAPNEL

SPIKE the eighteen wheeler like a pioneer wagon inundated by 
Apache arrows.

THE BLUE INVERTED CONE

disintegrates into floating blue particles.

is like a caged lion sensing a chance to escape.

EXT. OUTER SPACE

The blue patch on the ionosphere shrinks to nothing.

kiss as the truck continues its slide.  They are aglow from 
the glittering blue particles that dance like fireflies.

INT. SERVER ROOM

On SCREEN: TRANSMISSION INCOMPLETE as the word INCOMPLETE 
blinks on and off.

EXT. NEW YORK - UNITED NATIONS BUILDING

THE MYSTERIOUS THUNDER CLOUDS

seem to IMPLODE, swallowing themselves until they disappear, 
revealing a clear sky.

The people around the building murmur and point, not knowing 
what to make of it.

EXT. ANTENNAE ARRAY FIELD

THE EIGHTEEN-WHEELER CATCHES on the growing pile of fallen 
antennae and flips over.

INT. SUPPLY TRUCK #2

Wiley and Lara do their best to hang on as their world 
somersaults.

EXT. ANTENNAE ARRAY FIELD

THEIR TRUCK

FLIPS in the air and...

... CRASHES to the ground.  

SLIDES, SPARKS flying.  

SLAMS into the fence,...

... UPROOTING POLES and PUSHING THE WIRE FENCE to the 
breaking point, but at least...

... it stops the truck in a 

TANGLE OF FENCE WIRE AND BLACKENED SNOW.

INT. SUPPLY TRUCK #2

They hang from their seat belts like a diagonal meat locker.

Wiley releases his seat belt and CRASHES to the cabs 
ceiling.

             LARA
      Wiley...

             WILEY
      Howdy-doody, Chief.

             LARA
        (weak, in jest)
      Every time I need you to take care 
      of the tiniest thing...

Wiley smirks, remembering those words from just a day ago.

             LARA
      Are you going to get me down or 
      take a nap?

Lara hangs upsidedown in her buttonless blouse.

             WILEY
      I dont know.  You look pretty sexy 
      up there.

EXT. ENTRY GATE

The previously stifled skyscraper TASMANIAN DEVIL is LOUDER, 
BLACKER, MORE VIOLENT.

EXT. ANTENNAE ARRAY FIELD
Wiley is Lara's crutch, helping her limp away from the truck 
carcass and through the cemetery of dead antennae.

             WILEY
      Not enough antennas to boost a T.V. 
      channel.

But then they see the encroaching TORNADO.

             LARA
      The array created the tornado, but 
      it also...

             LARA & WILEY
      ... held it back.

             WILEY
      Oh shit.

             LARA
      Times two.


TREMORS ROCK them as they stumble out of the antennae field.

EXT. ENTRY GATE

TREMORS ROCK the entry gate booth and fence.

The TORNADO invades the compound, SWALLOWING the fence line 
and entry gate booth.

INT. STORAGE ROOM

TREMORS wobble the makeshift cell.

             KRUZ
      What the hell is going on up there?

EXT. ALASKA - A.I.R. - ANTENNAE ARRAY FIELD

The WIND AND RAIN BUFFET their hair and clothes.  Wiley 
steers Lara towards the eastern fence line for their escape 
into the forest.

             LARA
      No!  The trees are like lightning 
      rods.

             WILEY
      We need a basement.

             LARA
      The underground storage room.

Wiley nods.

EXT. A.I.R. - HANGAR

THE METAL STRUCTURE SQUEALS AND SWAYS at its joints.

INT. CONTROL TOWER

SERIES OF SHOTS

Everything SHAKES out of control.

Lights go out in the hallways, panel by panel

Out in the control tower

Out in the server room

The SHAKING screen reads: TRANSMISSION INCOMPLETE and 
shrinks to a dot until it disappears.

EXT. CONTROL BUILDING

WIND AND RAIN WHIP about wildly.  Wiley and Lara struggle to 
run as they pass a still unconscious Oleg.

Cranium-cracking THUNDER SMACKS like territorial mountain 
goats in an echo chamber. 

The RAIN -- like toothpicks in their eyes.

LIGHTNING TEARS the horizon in pieces.

EXT. COURTYARD

They run towards the storage building.  THE TORNADO SPINS its 
way towards the control building, closing on them.

EXT. CONTROL BUILDING

THE CONTROL TOWER EXPLODES into a billion fragments that 
grind to nothing as they swirl within the maelstroms vortex.  

THE TORNADO ROARS in victory amidst the rubble.  

EXT. COURTYARD

GREAT CRACKS THROUGH ICE AND DIRT 

spread through the courtyard. 

The GROUND SHIFTS and DISPLACES huge jigsaw puzzle pieces of 
earth.

LIGHTNING 

STRIKES the ground around them. Its like running through an 
air mine field as they leap and climb over 

SEVERELY UNEVEN TERRAIN.

A STRAY LIGHTNING BOLT

trails off and ZAPS A GENERATOR.

BOOM!

EXT. CONTROL BUILDING

Oleg wakes to an unwanted shower.  His world enveloped in a 
martini shaker.

He drags himself up, surfing on a jackhammer as he heads 
eastward toward the forest.

EXT. COURTYARD

A black and blue and red Mikhail spots Oleg.

             COMRADE BEARDED MIKHAIL
      Oleg!

But Oleg cant hear him.  

Mikhail runs drunkenly towards Oleg.

EXT. HANGAR

A LARGE FISSURE 

SPRAYS through the hangars foundation.

Mikhail tries to get past the CRUMBLING HANGAR.

The grounds jagged mouth OPENS WIDE.

Mikhail and the hangar are SWALLOWED by the earths voracious 
maw.

EXT. STORAGE BUILDING

LIGHTNING CLAWS gorge their way to the metal roof.

THE ROOF

FOLDS AND CRUMPLES.

THE ROW OF SEMIS

SMASH into each other like giant, metallic dominoes.

INT. STORAGE ROOM

DUST AND DEBRIS SHOWER the hostages.  Kruz has everyone 
stacking crates and equipment into pillars to brace the 
ceiling.

EXT. STORAGE BUILDING

The storage building looks like its been stepped on by 
Godzilla.

             WILEY
      Kruz!  God...

Lara grabs Wileys hand.

             LARA
      Nothings hopeless.

Lara scans the area.

             LARA
      We have to head towards open field.
        (looks around)
      That way!

They run south where there is wide, flat land.


EXT. EASTERN FENCE LINE
Oleg sees the Wrangell St. Elias National Park to the east 
and the cut fence section left by Gurov.

He staggers towards it.

EXT. A.I.R. - SOUTH END

The rain has subsided and the storm is strangely quiet.  
Wiley and Lara breathe heavily.  

Lara sniffs the air.  The pungent smell of...

             LARA
      Sulfur...

             WILEY
      Thats bad, right?

Horrific HISSING rises to a crescendo, like locusts by Bose.  
Behind them, 

THE STRANGE TORNADO

is luminescent on the inside from the ELECTRICAL STORM RAGING 
within its bowels.

Multiple LIGHTNING BOLTS STREAKS -- at each end of the 
arthritic fingers is...

             LARA
      ... ball lightning.

COLORFUL LIGHTNING BALLS

ZIGZAG erratically and horizontally.  

Some just DISSIPATE, 

some hover before moving again, and 

others EXPLODE like bombs leaving a thick, black trail of 
inky smoke.

A MYRIAD OF BALL LIGHTNING

orchestrate their Fourth of July celebration in a symphony of 
EXPLOSIONS.

EXT. EASTERN FENCE LINE - CREEK BED

Oleg crawls through the cut section of the fence, but... 

... loses his footing and...

... slides down to the sandy area of the creek bed.

Like an alien planet -- the creek bed is filled with massive 
ten to thirty foot fulgurites that ascend like stalagmites.

MORE LIGHTNING

SMASHES into the sand, creating another fulgurite in front of 
a FREAKED OUT OLEG.

FULGURITES

are SHATTERED by lightning bolts, 

FRESH FULGURITES rise in the crowded space.

Oleg tries to scramble out of the creek bed, but...

... A FLASH of LIGHTNING SMACKS him.  He shakes violently as 
if someone stuck the worlds largest electric toothbrush up 
his ass.

AN ELECTRIC FINGER

YANKS a syrupy string of sand and rock and flesh, leaving a 
GROTESQUE OSSIFIED TRAIL as it instantly TEARS OLEG APART, 
petrifying his misshapen remains.

EXT. SOUTH END

TREES AND BRUSH along the sides of the open field BURST into 
flame.  

BALL LIGHTNING CRATERS the ground like a war zone.

Wiley and Lara

dodge EXPLODING BALLS of lightning in the air around them and 
the ground at their feet.  

A LARGE ONE

DETONATES just behind them, sending THEM FLYING.

EXT. COURTYARD

The TORNADO COCOON -- pregnant with radiant life.  

A HUGE GLOWING BALL

inside the tornado, fighting to escape.

EXT. SOUTH END

Wiley helps Lara to her feet when he notices the strange 
TORNADO HYBRID.

             WILEY
      Aw, now what the hell is that?

             LARA
      Mother Nature giving birth to 
      Olegs offspring.

Suddenly, their faces reflect an iridescent blue light.  As 
if witnessing the coming of E.T.

EXT. COURTYARD

A GIANT BALL LIGHTNING

PULSES inside the still expanding tornado.

Like Clark Kents clothes, the tornadic threads rip away from 
the Superman Sphere.

SPIDERY ELECTRIC LEGS

feel their way in staccato-like fashion as the ball lightning 
hovers above the earth.

PULSATING at an accelerated rate and MUSHROOMS!

The EXPLOSION

fans out in an increasing radius that ELECTRIFIES everything 
it touches -- 

ANTENNAE,

BUILDING STRUCTURES, 

TREES, BRUSH, BERMS, AND 

EVEN FULGURITES.

EXT. SOUTH END

THE EDGE OF THE BOOM WAVE races towards them.

             LARA
      No!  Dont move! --  Stay right 
      there.

Wiley freezes.

             LARA
      Were not going to outrun this 
      thing, so just do as I say.

Lara demonstrates the correct position as she explains it.

             LARA
      Crouch down and wrap your arms 
      tight.

The onrush of the ELECTRIC FORCE closing on them.

Wiley turns around.

             LARA
      Dont look!  Make yourself as small 
      as possible and rise up on the 
      balls of your feet.

Balancing on the balls of their shoes, their HEELS lift off 
the ground.

             WILEY
      Youre not going to make me kiss my 
      own ass, are ya?

             LARA
      Stick your head down and keep your 
      eyes and mouth shut, no matter what 
      happens!

THE ELECTRIC CURRENT

WASHES over and around them, their hair and clothes fly 
forward in the violent surge.

Everything turns

WHITE.

A CESSNAS PROPELLER disturbs the tranquility of the 
aftermath.

EXT. ALASKA - SKY

Melvins Cessna flies in a angled curve.

Wiley gazes into his wifes eyes.

             WILEY
      What do we tell Bell?

             LARA
      Weve only been separated for a few 
      months.  Shell never know the 
      difference.

EXT. ALASKA - A.I.R. - STORAGE BUILDING

Emergency workers are helping the hostages out of the rubble.

KRUZ

EXT. COURTYARD

Lara leans her head against Wileys chest.

             LARA
      Wonder what happened to your 
      friend.  Gurov.

Wiley shakes his head sadly, but --

Over by the crumpled, smoking pile that was the control 
building, Wiley spots

GUROV'S SHOVEL

planted in the ground like a grave marker.

Wiley walks over and pulls it out.  

Written on the spade with black cinder are the words: NOT 
YET

Wiley ponders Gurovs words and half-smiles.

EXT. CESSNA

THE ENGINE GURGLES as the PROPELLER of the parked plane THUDS 
rapidly.

INT. CESSNA

Melvin is speaking on a cell phone as his plane idles.  Turns 
around and hands the phone to the backseat.

Mara takes the phone.

      Bel?... Bel!  Hows our --

Wiley grins.

             MARA
      Its... snowing?  In Los Angeles?

Mara gives Wiley a worried look.  Wileys brow furrows, he 
leans close to the phone.

EXT. CALIFORNIA - DISNEYLAND

Grandma Irene takes the phone from Bel whose attention 
transitions to a bag of Cheetos.  A snowy mountainside sits 
behind them.  Screams in the background.

             GRANDMA IRENE
      Mara?...  Yes, dear...  No, no...

INT. CESSNA

Mara chuckles.

             MARA
      Ohhh!
        (to Wiley)
      Its okay...

Mara kisses Wiley.

Melvin shakes his head as they take off.

EXT. CALIFORNIA - DISNEYLAND

Grandma Irene and Bel walk hand in hand.  On the other side 
of the railing, a bobsled full of screaming kids PLUNGE into 
the Matterhorns ALPINE POND at the bottom of the ride.

             GRANDMA IRENE
      So what about that husband of 
      yours?...

Clear, blue skies above.

FADE OUT.
