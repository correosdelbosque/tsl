EXT. FIELD - DAWN/THANKSGIVING

A deer hops through waist-high grass, not far from...

KELLER DOVER, camouflage, hunting rifle in hand.  A 
serious man, imposing, still built like a prize fighter 
at 37.  

He doesnt move a muscle; letting his son take the 
shot...

RALPH DOVER, 15, aims his rifle, a little shaky, still 
learning.  He squeezes the trigger -- POP POP --  

The deer stumbles towards us, shot in the neck.  It backs 
up and collapses.  The high grass hides its final moments 
in a canopy of swaying tendrils.  

EXT. HIGHWAY - LATER

Still early morning.  A pick-up truck barrels down the 
highway.  On the tailgate, in painted letters it says: 
KELLER DOVER REMODELING & REPAIRS.

From above we see the shot deer lying in the pick-ups 
flatbed. 

INT. KELLERS TRUCK - TRAVELING

Keller drives.  Ralph sits in the passenger seat.  The 
Everyday Testament is playing while Keller talks over it.

                 KELLER
       Most important thing your Grandpa 
       ever taught me.  Be ready. 
       Hurricane, flood, whatever it ends 
       up being.  No more food gets 
       delivered to the grocery store, 
       gas stations dry up.  People turn 
       on one another and all of a sudden 
       all that stands between you and 
       being dead is you. 

He looks at Ralph.  Ralph nods, idolizes his father even 
if he barely understands him.  Keller nods back, not 
finished, not satisfied, but done talking.  He turns the 
Everyday Testament up --

                 EVERYDAY TESTAMENT
       And he heard me; out of the belly 
       of hell cried I, and thou heardest 
       my voice.  For thou hadst cast me 
       into the deep --

EXT. FAIRMOUNT CIRCLE - DAY/THANKSGIVING DAY

AN OLD YELLOWED RV as it weaves through CONYERS, 
PENNSYLVANIA: a blue collar town whose best days are half 
a century behind it.

The RV turns onto Fairmount Circle, creeping past modest 
houses with slush covered lawns, past KELLER DOVERS 
HOUSE, his pick-up truck parked in the driveway.

The RV disappears around the bend as...

The Dovers' front door opens and Kellers daughter, ANNA, 
6, walks out into the cold, followed by his wife, GRACE, 
a fragile looking beauty with a whisper thin voice:

 
                 GRACE
      Wait, Anna.

                 ANNA
       Are we taking the truck?

Ralph comes out, cradling a couple hunks of venison 
bleeding through butchers paper.

                 RALPH
       Were going up the street you 
       dope.

Keller comes out.  Anna runs up to him, motioning for him 
to pick her up --

                 ANNA
       Give me a ride.

Keller gives her a smile, squats down, lets her jump on 
his back --  

                 KELLER
       Up you go --


Keller hoists Anna up on his shoulders, Grace watching 
on, smiling.

Anna riding on his shoulders, Keller leads his family 
down the street to the Birches' house.

                 RALPH
           (to Keller)
       Danny's Dad said he'd sell me 
       their old car.  I got half of what 
       I need saved from the summer -- 
       thought maybe --

                 KELLER
       Forget it.  I'm barely getting 
       enough carpentry work to keep up 
       with the mortgage.

                 RALPH
       Why dont you rent out Grandpa's 
       old apartment house? 

Keller looks at Grace whos grinning smugly.

                 KELLER
           (to Ralph)
       Like I keep telling your mother, 
       it's an old building.  Cost a 
       fortune to fix it up. 

THE BIRCHES' HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER


Keller bends down so Anna can ring the doorbell.  He puts 
her down, the family waiting on the doorstep like mute 
carolers.

The door opens and theyre welcomed by their neighbors 
and long time friends THE BIRCHES: 

FRANKLIN, 36, a bespectacled music teacher who already 
has a drink in his hand.  His wife NANCY, 32 -- tough, 
happy, no nonsense.

                 NANCY
       Happy Thanksgiving.  Keller, you 
       bring that poor deer you shot? 

                 KELLER
       No Maam, this ones Ralphs.

Ralph shyly accepts credit with an awkward smile.  Keller 
slaps him on the back, proud as can be.  Behind Franklin 
and Nancy stand their two girls: ELIZA, 15, and hiding 
behind her is JOY, 7, shy, wears glasses.

Anna bolts inside, running into the house with Joy.

                 KELLER 
       Anna, we wait until were invited.


Grace rolls her eyes.

                 NANCY
       Oh, for Gods sake, Keller, get 
       the hell in here.


INT. KITCHEN - THE BIRCHES' HOUSE - LATER


Nancy peeks at the venison, then wraps it back up while 
Grace chops an onion --

                 NANCY
       Youre in charge of this.  
       Us veterinarians make lousy 
       butchers.

 
                 GRACE
      No problem.

Keller and Franklin work to insert the leaf in the dining  
table -- its not fitting.  Keller uses his utility knife 
to shoehorn it.  Anna comes running in, goes to straight 
to Keller -- 

                 ANNA
       Can I go outside with Joy?

                 KELLER
       Convince your brother to go with 
       you and you can.

Anna races from the kitchen as Grace yells after her:

                 GRACE
       Wear your hat, youre still 
       getting over that cold.

EXT. FAIRMOUNT CIRCLE - DAY


Joy and Anna take off running, racing each other.  Ralph 
and Eliza take their time following them.  

                 ELIZA
       You feel bad for that deer when 
       you shot it?

                 RALPH
       You feel bad for cows when you go 
       to McDonald's?
           (off her confused 
            look)
       That's what my dad says.  

                 RALPH 
       And the deer, they have too many 
       babies and the babies starve 
       anyway.  You gotta keep the 
       population down.

                 ELIZA
       Your Dad say that too?

                 RALPH
           (a little 
            embarrassed)
       Yeah.  But I agree with him.

                 ELIZA
       What do you say?

He doesnt look quite sure.  She smiles, amused, 
obviously smitten.  He looks up ahead --

                 RALPH
           (yelling to the 
            girls)
       Hey, get away from that thing!

That old RV is parked up ahead on the side of the road, 
the girls are racing each other to it.  Joy leaves Anna 
in the dust -- SLAPS the RV's bumper victoriously.

Ralph and Eliza pick up the pace and catch up to them.  
The RV is parked in front of a house with a FOR SALE 
sign.

                 RALPH 
       Come on, let's go.

Eliza walks along the RV peering up at opaque windows 
smeared with filth.

                 ELIZA
       Gross.


Anna starts to climb a little ladder on the back of the 
RV, when Ralph pulls her off --

       Lets go --

                 RALPH

Eliza grabs Joys hand and shooshes Ralph.  

                 ELIZA
       Do you hear that?

They all stop and listen.  A radio just came on inside 
the RV: some 1970s Christian folk song.  

                 ELIZA 
       Somebodys in there.

Anna chucks a piece of ice and it SMASHES LOUD on the 
side of the RV.  Ralph grabs her hand.  

                 RALPH
       Cut the shit, I dont feel like 
       getting yelled at.  Lets go.

Eliza takes Joys hand and the four of them continue on 
around the block...     

The rear windshield of the RV.  A shadow appears behind 
the filthy glass, watching them go...     

INT. DINING ROOM - THE BIRCHES' HOUSE - LATER

The post-dinner table.  Dirty dishes piled, half empty 
wine glasses.  The sound of laughter from the next 
room...

INT. LIVING ROOM - THE BIRCHES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Keller and Grace sit beside one another.  Grace is 
drinking wine.  Keller drinks milk.  Nancy shakes her 
head as Franklin enters with his trumpet, obviously 
drunk.

                 FRANKLIN
       Im taking requests.

Anna and Joy run in behind him.

                 ANNA
       Mom, can I take Joy to our house?

 
                 GRACE
      Why?

                 ANNA
       My red whistle.  Shes going to 
       help me look for it.

Grace shakes her head.  

                 GRACE
       Sweetie, I think that whistle is 
       long gone.

Anna just stares back, waiting for another answer until:


                 GRACE 
       Fine, but get Ralph and Eliza to 
       go with you please.

    
                 NANCY
   What whistle?

                 ANNA
       The emergency whistle Daddy gave 
       me.  I lost it...
           (thinking)
       Hundred and thirty-three days ago.

                 GRACE
       Shes just like her father.

                 FRANKLIN
           (to Anna and Joy)
       If you want to find a whistle, you 
       have to whistle for it.

Franklin whistles a little something.  Keller rolls his 
eyes.  Anna and Joy fire back with a tuneless sampling of 
Jingle Bells.  Everybody laughs.  The girls take a bow, 
and exit.  

                 FRANKLIN 
       OK, Keller, what do you want to 
       hear?

                 GRACE
           (giggling, a little 
            drunk)
       He used to love Springsteen in 
       high school.

                 FRANKLIN
       Got too much respect for the Boss -
       - cant cover him drunk.

  
                 KELLER
     Thank you.

                 GRACE
       Oh, he likes the Star Spangled 
       Banner.

Franklin starts to play the Banner.  Nancy throws a couch 
pillow at him, laughing.

                 KELLER
           (smiling, getting up)
       Think I need a refill.

INT. KITCHEN - THE BIRCHES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Grace enters, Franklins Banner blaring through the 
house.  Keller pours himself a fresh glass of milk, his 
back to her.

                 KELLER
       Think you hit the limit with the 
       wine, hon.

She sneaks up and wraps her arms around him --

                 GRACE
       Uh huh.  Having fun?

He turns around, immediately taken by her tipsy adoring 
eyes.  

                 KELLER
       When I get you home I will be.

                 GRACE
           (coyly)
       Well see about that.

She kisses him passionately as Franklin's Banner reaches 
its soaring climax.

EXT. THE BIRCHES' HOUSE - DUSK

The sun sets behind the Birch house.  

INT. BASEMENT/TV ROOM - THE BIRCHES' HOUSE - DUSK

Ralph and Eliza sit watching TV.  They look lobotomized 
with boredom.  Keller walks in.

                 KELLER
       Where are your sisters?

They both shrug their shoulders.  Grace comes in behind 
Keller, flushed from too much wine.  

                 GRACE
           (to Keller)
       I cant find them.

                 KELLER
           (to Ralph and Eliza)
       Did you take them to look for the 
       whistle?

Ralph and Eliza just stare blankly.

          RALPH
       Dad, what are you talking about?

                 GRACE
       They didnt come to get you 
       earlier -- they were supposed to 
       come and get you.

                 ELIZA
       We havent seen them since we ate.

Keller puts his hand on Graces shoulder, steadying her.

                 KELLER
       Dont worry, theyre probably at 
       our house.  

EXT. FAIRMOUNT CIRCLE - DUSK

Keller jogs down the street without his coat on.

INT. KITCHEN - THE DOVERS' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Keller moves fast through the kitchen...

 
                 KELLER
      Girls?  

INT. STAIRS - THE DOVERS' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Keller double times it up the stairs...

 
                 KELLER
      Anna?  Girls?

INT. HALLWAY - THE DOVERS' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Keller runs in and out of the bedrooms one by one.  
Theyre not here.

INT. BASEMENT - THE DOVERS' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

The light clicks on, Keller rushes down the stairs and 
looks around.  Food and water to last a lifetime.  
Chemical toilets.  Meds for radiation sickness.  Guns.  
No girls.

INT. LIVING ROOM - THE BIRCHES' HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Grace, Nancy and Ralph wait anxiously in the living room.  
Keller rushes in, out of breath.

 
                 KELLER
      Are they here?

                 GRACE
       Oh God.


                 FRANKLIN
       I dont believe this.  

Eliza enters from another room.

                 ELIZA
       I looked all over the house, 
       theyre not here.

                 RALPH
       The RV, Dad there was this RV and 
       they were playing on it.  There 
       was someone inside I think --

                 KELLER
       Where?


EXT. FAIRMOUNT CIRCLE - CONTINUOUS

Keller, Ralph and Franklin burst out the door.

                 KELLER
           (to Franklin)
       Go that way, well meet you on the 
       other side.

We follow Keller and Ralph as they sprint down the middle 
of the street.  They slow, seeing ROGER, 40s, standing on 
his stoop puffing on a cigar -- 

                 KELLER 
       Roger, have you seen my daughter 
       walk by here?

Roger shakes his head.  Then watches on, confused, as 
Ralph and Keller take off again, hauling ass down the 
street...

Ralph makes a hard stop, pointing at some big tracks in 
the slush where the RV was parked.  

                 RALPH
       Here.  It was here.

Keller looks up at the empty house with the FOR SALE sign 
on its lawn.  He makes a beeline for the front door.

                 KELLER
       Were you guys messing around in 
       this house?

                 RALPH
       No.


Keller tries the front door.  Its locked.  Franklin 
comes running from the other direction, out of breath, 
shaking his head.  Keller pulls out his cell phone, 
dialing...

                 KELLER
           (to Ralph)
       Tell me everything you can 
       remember about that RV...

INT. SAIKEI GARDEN - LATER

DETECTIVE LOKI, 33, sits at a darkened table, finishing 
up his duck.  Hes the only customer.  Hair cropped, suit 
pressed; looks more like a cadet than a detective.  The 
WAITRESS walks over with the check, Chinese, 25, 
gorgeous, all smiles.

                 WAITRESS
       Happy Thanksgiving, Detective.

Loki gets up, pays the check in cash, gets his coat on --

                 LOKI
       No fortune cookie?

                 WAITRESS
       My boss told me cops dont like 
       fortune cookies.

Loki ponders this, amused.  Shes smiling at him.  His 
phone rings -- 

INT. LOKIS SEDAN - PARKED/SAIKEI GARDEN - NIGHT

Loki starts his car, watches the fog disappear from his 
windshield while listening to cross chatter on the police 
radio.  He peers out at the restaurant, can see the 
Waitress busy inside.  

                 DISPATCH
       ...caller reported an RV matching 
       the description -- vehicle is 
       parked at a rest stop off of Route 
       forty-six, northbound, past exit 
       seventeen -- any available units?

Loki considers, still watching the waitress -- he picks 
up his radio --

                 LOKI
       This is 1340, Im five minutes 
       away -- heading over --

Loki throws the car in gear, pulls out --

                 COP 1 (V.O.)
       This is 1212, responding.

                 COP 2 (V.O.)
       1080 -- responding.

                 LOKI
       No lights, no sirens.  Wait for 
       me.

EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

The gas station lot appears to be empty but for the 
parked RV facing the adjacent woods.  But as the angle 
widens we see another vehicle, parked across the way, 
cloaked in darkness...

A cop car, with two uniformed cops sitting impatiently 
inside, late twenties: CARTER and WEDGE.  Loki drives up 
beside them and everybody gets out --

Loki draws his sidearm, following behind Carter and Wedge 
as they approach the RV --

Carter and Wedge are maybe ten feet from the RVs side 
door when ITS ENGINE ROARS to life.  IT STARTS BACKING 
UP, positioning for the on-ramp.  Carter and Wedge look 
to Loki -- What now?

Then, going the wrong way on the on-ramp, ANOTHER COP CAR 
BLOCKS THE RVS ESCAPE, forcing it to change course, 
angling right for the adjacent WOODS now, accelerating 
until...

THE RV SMASHES THROUGH THE TREES, burrowing into the 
woods for a few yards until it GRINDS TO A HALT --

Loki runs up behind the RV, Wedge and Carter right behind 
him, trudging over the newly flattened forest, BLACK 
SMOKE EVERYWHERE -- 

Lost in the smoke, Loki moves up alongside the RV.  He 
peers through the portal glass on the side door:

A giant branch has punched through the windshield, 
reaching all the way to the back of the RV.  Nobodys 
there.  He tries the door, its locked --


INT. RV - CONTINUOUS

The side door, as its SMASHED IN.  Loki moves inside, 
gun at the ready -- COUGHING -- his crazed eyes scanning 
the RVs dark interior...  He sees something, aims his 
gun down at...

A disheveled man cowering under the little kitchen table, 
his head bleeding from the crash, 34, thick glasses, big 
bushy beard.  This is ALEX JONES.

                 LOKI
       Show me your hands.  Get down on 
       your stomach -- on the floor --

Jones complies, looking terrified.  Loki puts his foot on 
Jones back while he cuffs his hands --

                 LOKI 
       Where are they?

Jones doesnt answer.  Loki gets up and starts 
frantically tossing the RV.  Wedge and Carter move inside 
--

                 LOKI 
       Theyre not here. 

Loki looks down at Jones, grabs him, lifts him to his 
feet -- 

                 LOKI 
       They in the woods?  Come on -- 
       youre gonna take me to them right 
       now -- right now --

Loki walks a cuffed Jones out of the RV --

EXT. RV - CONTINUOUS

Loki pushes Jones out of the RV, Carter and Wedge right 
behind them -- 

Loki pushes Jones towards the edge of the woods where the 
RV was parked.  Jones trips -- Loki pulls him up -- 
shoves him, but Jones wont move --

                 LOKI
       Go -- WALK!  Im gonna fucking 
       shoot you if you dont start 
       walking --  

Carter and Wedge flash their flashlights around the edge 
of the woods, illuminating a slurry of leaves, slush and 
mud -- theres nothing there --

Loki grabs Wedges flashlight, shines it in Jones 
eyes...he looks completely out of it -- 

                 LOKI 
       What the fuck are you on?    

Loki breathes out, hands Jones off to Wedge -- 

                 LOKI 
           (to Wedge)
       Put him in the car -- see if you 
       can sober him up --

The two uniformed cops who were driving the other patrol 
car come running over --

                 LOKI 
       Victims might be in the woods.  
       See if PSP can loan us their scent 
       dogs.      

Loki motions around at the rest stop --

                 LOKI 
       Seal all this off, the entrance -- 
       all of it. 
           (to one of the cops)
       You -- come on -- 

Loki rushes into the woods, Carter and one of the two 
uniformed cops following after, the other uniformed cop 
gets on his radio, watching as Wedge puts Jones in the 
squad car -- 

EXT. FAIRMOUNT CIRCLE - NIGHT


Ralph trails Keller, the two of them marching across a 
neighbor's lawn, shining their flashlights, searching.  
A GROGGY MAN, 52, peeks his head out the front door.

                 GROGGY MAN
       What the fucks going on?

He sees it's Keller and loses the bravado quick. 

                 KELLER
       Looking for my girl.  Annas 
       missing.

Groggy Man gets his glasses on and sees the throngs of 
people walking down the street with flashlights. 

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Cut-up from the crash, Alex Jones stands against the 
wall.  He seems spacey if not downright schizophrenic, 
staring blankly at the picture of Anna and Joy, Loki 
holds in front of his face.

                 JONES
       No.

                 LOKI
       No?  They werent playing on your 
       RV?

CUT TO:

THE RV AS FORENSICS TEARS IT APART

FORENSICS GUY, 55, pulls out ceiling panels one by one -- 
two FORENSICS TECHS and a POLICE MECHANIC in the bg. 

                 JONES
       I didnt see them.  Can I sit 
       down?

The grungy carpet of the RV as Forensics Guy rips it off 
the floor.

                 LOKI
       Where do you usually park the RV?

An old eight track tape -- Heaven's Gonna Be A Blast -- 
as Forensics Guy pops it out of the dash.  

                 JONES
       My aunts house.

EXT. BACKYARD - HOLLY JONES' HOUSE - NIGHT

The house: squalid, small and yellow.  


                 JONES
       She lets me park it in the back 
       yard.  The grass dont grow back 
       there anyway.

Loki paces around in the backyard.  Theres a beat-up 
Trans Am parked on the lawn, covered in dirt.  

Jones Aunt, HOLLY JONES, 53, comes out the back door, 
hugging herself against the cold.  She has a regal face, 
her long greying hair grown down past her waist.   

                 HOLLY JONES
           (hollering to Loki)
       It was my husbands.  Its for 
       sale if you want it.

 
                 LOKI
      No thanks.

Loki rubs some dirt from one of the Trans Ams windows 
and peers inside.  Nothing there.  

INT. HOLLY JONES' HOUSE NIGHT

Holly Jones leads Loki through cramped hallways, past 
little rooms clogged with old furniture.

                 LOKI
       Does he sleep in the RV?

                 HOLLY JONES
       In the summertime he does, but 
       this time of year he sleeps on the 
       couch.  

She motions to a frayed sofa bed, where a MONGREL DOG is 
curled up sleeping.

                 LOKI
       Where are his things?

INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - HOLLY JONES' HOUSE - NIGHT

Holly leads Loki into the small room.  Atop a chest of 
drawers sits a framed photo of her, circa 1970s, young 
and beautiful, sitting inside the then brand new RV, with 
her long haired, hippie husband.

                 HOLLY JONES
       My husband.  We had a fight...God, 
       almost five years ago.  

                 HOLLY JONES 
       He walked out and didnt come 
       back. Alex loved him like a father.

                 LOKI
       What happened to Alexs real 
       parents?

                 HOLLY JONES
       My husbands brother and his 
       girlfriend.  They died in a car 
       accident when Alex was six.  

She opens the top drawer and presents it to Loki: some 
sorry looking clothes.  A little Matchbox RV.  

                 HOLLY JONES 
       He doesnt have much.

EXT. FAIRMOUNT CIRCLE - NIGHT

Keller and Ralph about to walk another lap around the 
circle when Franklin pulls up in his car and rolls down 
his window --

                 FRANKLIN
       They found the RV -- girls weren't 
       inside.  Parked on that rest stop 
       near the south woods.  They're 
       putting together a search party.  

Keller and Ralph get into the car and Franklin takes off -
-

INT. GARAGE - POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Whats left of the RV.  Sitting inside at the little 
kitchen table is Forensics Guy -- smarter than most, 
likes his job.  Hes thinking, head leaned back, eyes 
closed.  Loki walks inside and SLAPS the table --

                 LOKI
       What do we got?

Forensics Guy takes a moment to think of something that 
makes him frown.

                 FORENSICS GUY
       This thing's clean.  I mean it's 
       filthy as shit, but we didn't find 
       anything.

Loki seems unfazed by this piece of news, thinking --

                 LOKI
       They could have been wearing 
       winter hats and mittens the whole 
       time they were in here.  So no 
       prints, no hair fibers.  

                 FORENSICS GUY
       If he just used this thing to 
       transport them I might buy that, 
       but if there was a struggle in 
       here I would have found something.  
       Id start searching the woods near 
       the rest stop.

                 LOKI
       Yeah, half the cops in the state 
       are doing that right now.  

Loki walks off --

                 LOKI 
       When youre done with this thing 
       take a team over to his Aunts 
       place.

EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

The gas station lot is swarming with cops and volunteers.  
Everyone is heading into the adjacent...  

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

A constellation of flashlights moves through the woods.  
Ralph sticks by Keller, their eyes scanning, exhausted.  
Franklin trails behind them.

EXT. FAIRMOUNT CIRCLE - MORNING

An AERIAL VIEW of LOKIS SEDAN heading down the street 
toward  the Dover House.

EXT. THE BIRCHES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

NEIGHBORS wanting to help, but not sure what to do mill 
around.  Lokis car pulls up...

INT. KITCHEN - THE BIRCHES HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Franklin leads Loki into the kitchen.  Nancy is sitting 
at the kitchen table, her back to them.  Remnants of 
thanksgiving on the table, yet to be cleared -- 

                 LOKI
       Mrs. Birch, Im Detective Loki -- 

Nancy turns, her expression worn with shock, but still 
composed -- doggedly holding on to herself.  She has some 
photos laid out on the table, hands one to Loki -- 

                 NANCY
       This is a better picture than the 
       one my husband gave you.  You can 
       see her eyes more clearly...

Loki takes the picture, nods -- Nancy staring up at him, 
imploring him with a hard look -- eyes swelling with 
tears. 

INT. RALPHS ROOM - THE DOVERS' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Ralph lies asleep on top of the covers, clothes and muddy 
sneakers still on.

INT. BATHROOM - THE DOVERS' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Keller splashes water on his face.  A little gold 
crucifix hangs around his neck.  

His eyes drift to the toothbrush holder.  The little 
toothbrush with the cartoon character on it.

INT. LIVING ROOM - THE DOVERS' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Grace is sitting on the couch next to Detective Loki, 
whos distracted, reading a text on his phone.  Grace is 
composed, but theres dread in her voice.

 
 
                 GRACE
      Did we pass?

                 LOKI
      What?

                 GRACE
       The poly-whatever -- the lie 
       detector we took this morning.

                 LOKI
           (puts the phone away)
       Sorry -- yes, we appreciate your 
       cooperation.

                 GRACE
       Nancys lawyer friend told us it 
       would help speed things up.  
       It's embarrassing, all this fuss.  
       Everyone's going to think we're 
       crazy when those two come out from 
       wherever they're hiding.  

                 LOKI
       You have some reason to think they 
       ran away?

                 GRACE
       No, they were happy, but they must 
       have run away...  

She looks to the window, her mind drifting as she listens 
to the faint sound of congregating neighbors outside.  

                 GRACE 
       The police captain said you've 
       solved every case you've ever been 
       assigned.  

Loki nods, pretends to be humble, looking around at the 
framed photos adorning the walls, mostly of Ralph and 
Anna.

                 GRACE 
       Do you have children, Detective?

Loki shakes his head.  She looks at him askance.  He 
touches her hand, his face taking on an unwavering 
conviction... 

                 LOKI
       Im gonna find your daughter.

She nods, tries to be comforted, wants to believe it.  

                 LOKI 
       We think the girls came back here 
       after they left you at the 
       Birches' yesterday.

Keller appears in the doorway.  

                 KELLER
       They were looking for Annas red 
       whistle.

Loki and Grace stand up. 

                 LOKI
       Right, I read your statement.

Keller offers his hand to Loki.  Loki looks him up and 
down, gives him a quick handshake -- a little cold.

                 LOKI 
       Detective Loki.  I'm heading up 
       the investigation into your 
       daughter's disappearance.  Please, 
       sit down.

Keller remains standing.  Grace grabs on to his arm.

                  KELLER
       Listen, my son told you, the guy 
       was hiding inside that RV, 
       watching them.

                 LOKI
       We havent found any physical 
       evidence in the RV, or his aunts 
       house where he lives.  Alex Jones 
       has the IQ of a ten year old and 
       theres no way he would have been 
       able to abduct two girls in broad 
       daylight and then somehow make 
       them disappear.

                 KELLER
       You give him a lie detector?

                 LOKI
       Yeah, we did.  Doesnt work if you 
       dont understand the questions.

                 KELLER
       What does that mean?  He ran.  
       They said he tried to get away.  

                 LOKI
       Were considering all 
       possibilities, Mr. Dover.  I know 
       what youre saying.  Im not 
       crossing anybody off the list.  
       Just let me do my job.     

Keller doesnt answer, looking far from satisfied.

EXT. DRIVEWAY - THE DOVERS' HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Lokis leaving in his car when Keller runs up alongside.  
Loki stops, rolls down his window --

                 KELLER
       He stays in custody until my 
       daughter is found, right?

                 LOKI
       Weve got a forty-eight hour hold 
       on him.  Ends tomorrow unless we 
       bring charges.  

                 KELLER
       Then charge him with something.

                 LOKI
       Mr. Dover, let me worry about --

                 KELLER
       Detective, two little girls gotta
       be worth whatever rules you have 
       to break to keep that asshole in
       custody.

Loki considers for a moment while Keller's desperate eyes 
bore into him... 

                 KELLER 
       I know you cant promise me 
       anything -- Im just asking you to 
       be sure.      

Loki doesnt answer.

                 KELLER 
       Thank you, Detective.  
       I appreciate it.

Loki nods and drives off --

INT. CAPTAINS OFFICE - POLICE STATION - DAY

CAPTAIN RICHARD OMALLEY sits at his desk shaking his 
head at Loki.

                 CAPTAIN RICHARD O'MALLEY
       Youre positive hes innocent, but 
       you want to keep holding him 
       anyway?  

                 LOKI
       Anna Dovers father --

                 CAPTAIN RICHARD O'MALLEY
       Since when are you mister bedside 
       fucking manner?

                 LOKI
       One more day --

                 CAPTAIN RICHARD O'MALLEY
       Fuck you.  You find his daughter, 
       hell forgive you, you dont, hes 
       gonna hate you anyway.

Loki takes that in.  OMalley gives him a long look...

                 CAPTAIN RICHARD O'MALLEY 
       Had my buddy from PSPs homicide 
       unit over for Thanksgiving...  

Loki looks a little caught...

                 CAPTAIN RICHARD O'MALLEY 
       If you wanted a transfer you 
       shouldve asked me.  PSPs 
       homicide unit is a fine place to 
       be -- Im sure youd fit right in 
       there.  But youre getting ahead 
       of yourself a little bit, dont 
       you think?

                 LOKI
       What do you want me to say?

                 CAPTAIN RICHARD O'MALLEY
       Nothing.  Why should you say 
       anything?  Not like I ever did 
       anything for you.

Some guilt sneaks into Lokis expression -- 

                 CAPTAIN RICHARD O'MALLEY 
       After the last round of layoffs I 
       got maybe two guys here who know 
       what theyre doing, and both of 
       them are in this room.   

                 LOKI
       Im not busting my ass everyday 
       just for privilege of going down 
       with the ship.  You know I love 
       you -- but its onward and upward.  

OMalley nods...a fatherly look of resignation on his 
face as he looks down at his hands, then after a moment 
he looks back up, face hard, meets Lokis eyes and nods 
tersely --  

                 CAPTAIN RICHARD O'MALLEY
       Find these kids, make me look good  
       -- and maybe Ill give you my 
       blessing.  So whats next?  Were 
       coming up on twenty-four hours 
       missing and you have exactly shit.  

                 LOKI
       Im knocking on doors all night.

Loki pulls a printout from his pocket.

                 LOKI 
       Got nine level three sex offenders 
       living within a ten mile radius of 
       Fairmount Circle.  

INT. LIVING ROOM - SEX OFFENDERS HOUSE 1 - NIGHT

A MAN, 50s, muscled, wearing a tank top and boxers -- 
looks like Loki woke him up.

DISSOLVE TO:

                 LOKI 
       Im gonna need an address and 
       phone number for everybody you 
       were with that day.

Lokis looking at a wall full of little nail holes --  

                 LOKI 
       What was hanging here?

INT. GARAGE - SEX OFFENDERS HOUSE 1 - NIGHT

The muscled man watches on as Loki opens a cardboard box -
- inside it are framed photos -- the muscled man, but 
skinny, younger -- standing with his then wife and kids. 

EXT. FAST FOOD RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Through the window we see Loki talking to a MALE 
EMPLOYEE, 27 -- working the register.  The Employee 
shakes his head emphatically -- 

EXT. LOKIS SEDAN - NIGHT

Loki walks to his car -- angle widens to reveal the 
downtown area.  Strip malls, gas stations -- cars 
whizzing by -- blurred faces in car windows -- 

EXT. BACK YARD - SEX OFFENDERS HOUSE 2 - NIGHT

A GREY HAIRED MAN, in his pajamas, shivering in the cold, 
watching as...

                 GREY HAIRED MAN
       I have bad arthritis -- havent 
       been out of the house in months.    

Looking like hes ready for this night to be over, Loki 
opens the door to the mans tool shed -- moves inside -- 
starts rifling around in the clutter, taking his 
aggression out -- holds up a porn magazine --

                 LOKI
       Youre not allowed to have this.

                 GREY HAIRED MAN
       I forgot it was in there.  I 
       promise Ill --

Loki tosses the magazine out onto the yard.  He keeps 
rifling  -- finds another magazine, another -- throws 
them out --

                 LOKI
       Whos your probation officer?  

EXT. YARD - NICE HOUSE 2 - NIGHT

Loki walks out the front door, the Grey Haired Man 
following after him -- 

                 GREY HAIRED MAN
       Please --


Loki stops, faces the man --

                 LOKI
       Get back inside.  

The man doesnt move -- Loki looks like hes going to 
blow --

                 LOKI 
       Get back inside!

The Grey Haired Man turns and shuffles back inside his 
house.  Loki breathes out, gets in his car --

EXT. SAINT EMILIANA CHURCH - NIGHT

Lokis headlights wash over a cheaply built grey house, 
its windows all boarded, a big white cross on its front.  
And right beside it...

A small grey house, THE RECTORY.  Lokis headlights wink 
out.  


INT. BLACK SEDAN - PARKED - CONTINUOUS

Looking beat, Loki pops a coffee bean in his mouth.  
He checks his notebook, crossing off the last of a long 
list of sex offenders.

EXT. FRONT DOOR - RECTORY - MOMENTS LATER

A cracked door bell as Loki pushes it and nothing 
happens.  He sighs, tired, pissed off.  He starts BEATING 
ON THE DOOR --

                 LOKI
           (yelling inside)
       Police.  Hello?  I need to talk to 
       you, Father.  Open the door.

He peers in a window near the door: a TV playing an old 
black and white war movie.  An old priest lying on the 
floor -- looks dead.

INT. LIVING ROOM - THE RECTORY - CONTINUOUS

Loki opens the unlocked front door and rushes inside...

He squats down beside the priest lying on the floor, 
FATHER PATRICK DUNN, 64, grizzled and bald.  Hes not 
dead, hes SNORING, passed out.  Empty liquor bottles are 
everywhere.

Loki considers, then stands up.

                 LOKI
       You mind if I look around?

Dunn doesnt seem to mind at all, still SNORING up a 
storm.  

INT. KITCHEN - RECTORY - CONTINUOUS

Loki turns on the light: a wall clock TICKING, a sink 
full of liquor bottles, an abandoned game of solitaire on 
the table, cards thrown on the floor...

Loki notices something: the refrigerators electric chord 
-- its stretched taught to the outlet, barely reaches.  
The fridge has been moved.  Loki looks closer -- sees the 
top of a door frame behind it...   

Loki walks to the refrigerator, shaking his head.  He 
sighs and starts shoving it off the door its blocking.  
The fridge is old and heavy and doesnt go easy...

INT. THE BASEMENT - THE RECTORY - MOMENTS LATER

The door opens, Loki takes the first step....THEN GRABS 
THE DOOR FRAME WILDLY -- THE STAIRS HAVE BEEN REMOVED.  
Its a ten foot drop to the basement floor...

Loki squats down and flashes his flashlight.  Piles of 
junk obscure his view...

He gets down and lets his legs dangle off the edge.  Then 
he turns around, gets in a hanging position, and drops --

He lands on his feet, then falls back on his ass.  He 
gets up, cursing under his breath, shining his flashlight 
-- suddenly startled by three big statues.  Saints.

Loki moves in closer.  Theres something behind them...

A MAN IN A CHAIR.  Loki loses his breath, draws his gun --

 
                 LOKI
      Hey!

Loki shines his flashlight on him...its a corpse, 
skeletal, long since dead.  What was once a very tall 
man, strapped to a chair with reams of duct tape.

                 LOKI 
       Christ.  

Loki moves in closer.  He notices a pendant hanging 
around the corpses neck with a maze-like design carved 
into it.

MOMENTS LATER

Loki drags a statue of a kneeling saint under the 
doorway.  

He steps on its back, reaches up and grabs the lip of the 
door frame.  Then, straining, he pulls himself up...

INT. KITCHEN - RECTORY - MOMENTS LATER

Father Dunn's POV as he comes to: Loki's dragged him to 
the basement door AND IS ABOUT TO TOSS HIM OVER THE EDGE, 
holding him by the back of his shirt.  Dunn is terrified, 
acting like there's burning lava down there --  

                 FATHER PATRICK DUNN
       NO!  NO!  Don't -- PLEASE!

                 LOKI
       Whos the corpse?  First name, 
       last name.  NOW, or down you go -- 
       leave you with your buddy for a 
       while.  Come on!  Whats his 
       name!?  Who is he?

                 FATHER PATRICK DUNN
       Couldnt go to the police.
       Theyd never believe a --

Loki leans him further over the edge -- DUNN SCREAMS --

                 LOKI
       I spent six years in the 
       Huntington Boys Home, father -- 
       hurting a fuck like you would be a 
       real treat for me!  

Dunn shakes his head, tears streaming --

                 FATHER PATRICK DUNN
       I DON'T KNOW HIS NAME!  Came to me 
       for confession.  Killed sixteen 
       children, he said.  Bragged about 
       it.  I convinced him to come back 
       here.  He was going to kill more. 
       He wouldnt tell me his name.

Loki rolls his eyes, yanks Dunn back from the edge -- 

                 LOKI
       Right.  Sixteen children huh?
       I think he was just trying to
       impress a fellow pervert scumbag --
       come on, time to go.

EXT. WOODS - MORNING

Keller trudges through the woods.  His cell phone rings.   
The caller ID: GRACE.  Keller answers -- 

                 KELLER
           (into the phone)
       Hey.

                 GRACE 
           (over the phone)
       Theyre letting him go.  

                 KELLER
           (into the phone)
       What?

                 GRACE 
           (over the phone)
       The man, the police said theyre 
       letting him go today.

                 KELLER
           (into the phone)
       OK, its OK.  Im gonna take care 
       of it. 

Keller hangs up, shocked, turns around.  Franklin and 
Ralph are about twenty yards behind him.  

He takes off running towards them, weaving between trees, 
stomping through the snow, running right past them --

                 RALPH
       Dad?  Where you going?

                 FRANKLIN
       Whats going on?

Keller doesnt answer, running past volunteers wearing 
SEARCH AND RESCUE jackets, startling a search dog --

INT. LOKIS DESK - POLICE STATION - DAY


Loki sits at his desk, researching Fairmount Circle on 
his computer -- Father Dunn is being interrogated in the 
BG.  Loki looks up, watching as Jones and his aunt are 
shown to the front desk...  

Jones aunt rubs his back as the DESK SERGEANT gives him 
paper work to fill out.  

Sign here.

DESK SERGEANT

He signs his release papers, slowly and methodically: 

Alex Winterman Jones.

EXT. POLICE STATION - MOMENTS LATER

A UNIFORMED COP escorts Jones and his Aunt out the front 
door.  Several reporters are waiting -- 

                 REPORTER 1
       Is this your Mother?

                 HOLLY JONES
       Dont talk to them, Alex.

                 REPORTER 2
       Do you have any comment on the 
       girls -- are you innocent?

Jones POV: the reporters accusing eyes, the grey sky, 
his Aunt squeezing his wrist --

The Uniformed escort tries to get the reporters to clear 
a path while TWO OTHER UNIFORMED COPS, just back from 
patrol come walking towards the entrance -- 

INT. LOKIS DESK - POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS

Loki peers out the window, sees the reporters cornering 
Jones and his aunt -- shakes his head...

Then he sees something else -- Kellers truck pulling 
into the parking lot --

                 LOKI
           (under his breath)
       Fuck.

Loki gets up in a hurry, calls out to several UNIFORM 
COPS milling around the station --

                 LOKI 
       Need some help out front -- 

EXT. POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS

Keller shoves past the reporters, making a bee line for 
Jones and his Aunt when the Uniformed escort blocks his 
path -- 

                 UNIFORMED ESCORT
       Sir, you need to step back --

But Keller keeps coming, the Uniformed escort grabs him -- 
the two Uniformed Cops just back from patrol rush to 
assist, Keller resisting as the three of them struggle to 
restrain him --

                 KELLER
       I just want to talk to him.

Loki exits the station, five cops trailing behind him -- 

                 LOKI
       You dont want to do this, Mr. 
       Dover -- 

                 KELLER
       Thanks to you hes a free man, 
       right?  Im a free man, hes a 
       free man -- why cant I talk to 
       him?

Keller struggles to break free of the gaggle of Uniformed 
Cops now trying like hell to get cuffs on him as he 
lunges at Jones -- Jones Aunt protectively trying to put 
herself between them -- 

                 KELLER 
       TELL ME WHERE THEY ARE!  

Keller tries to get around Jones Aunt as Jones backs 
away -- tearing up, shaking his head, overloading --

                 KELLER 
       TELL ME WHAT YOU DID WITH THEM!

KELLER PUSHES PAST JONES AUNT.  A UNIFORM COP BLOCKS HIS 
PATH -- KELLER COLDCOCKS HIM -- KNOCKS ANOTHER COP TO THE 
CEMENT.  THE OTHERS TRY TO GRAB HIM, BUT HE BREAKS FREE --

Jones takes off running -- Keller tackles him between two 
parked cars -- grabs him by the shirt --    

                 JONES
           (to Keller)
       They didnt cry until I left them.

Keller freezes, in shock -- looks around -- did anybody 
else hear that?   HES SWALLOWED BY ANGRY COPS -- 
STRUGGLES -- GETS SMASHED DOWN in a blur of uniforms, 
angry faces and fists --

Kellers finally forced to the pavement and handcuffed, 
watching with crazed helpless eyes as Jones and his Aunt 
are whisked away.


INT. CAPTAINS OFFICE - POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS

Loki walks in, OMalley is talking to Keller, whos 
handcuffed to a chair.  When Keller sees Loki he shakes 
his head in bitter disgust.

                 LOKI
           (off Kellers look)
       Listen, I tried --

                 CAPTAIN RICHARD O'MALLEY
       Im talking here.
           (back to Keller)


                 CAPTAIN RICHARD O'MALLEY
       I know your Dad was a guard at 
       Graterford, and I got a daughter 
       of my own so Im gonna show some 
       mercy on you.  

O'Malley uncuffs Keller from the chair.  Keller stands 
up.

                 CAPTAIN RICHARD O'MALLEY 
       As for Alex Jones, he has orders 
       not to leave the commonwealth.   

                 KELLER
       What about what I just fucking 
       told you?!  Why aren't you sending 
       someone to go arrest this guy?!

                 CAPTAIN RICHARD O'MALLEY
       Mr. Dover, tell Detective Loki 
       what you told me -- he will 
       definitely look into it.  And when 
       you're done, I need you to go 
       home.  
       Your family needs you at home, not 
       hanging around here.  

Before Keller can argue OMalley exits into THE CHAOTIC 
HALLWAY and shuts the door.

                 LOKI
       You have something to tell me, Mr. 
       Dover?

Keller takes a moment, bludgeoning Loki with his eyes, 
then:

                 KELLER
       That asshole you promised me you'd 
       keep in custody, when I grabbed 
       him in the parking lot, he said 
       right to my fucking face: they 
       didn't cry until I left them.  

                 LOKI
       Just now in the parking lot?  

                 KELLER
       What did I say -- yeah, just now 
       in the parking lot.  

                 LOKI
       Anybody hear besides you?

Keller shakes his head bitterly.

                 LOKI 
       You sure you heard him right?

                 KELLER
       Jesus Christ -- you think I'm 
       making this up?

Loki observes Kellers hands are shaking...  

                 LOKI
       OK, Ill go see him.

Keller stops, looks him in the eye.

                 KELLER
       Don't go see him.  Go arrest him.  

Keller turns and walks out.  Loki watches the door slam, 
his mind working...


INT. LIVING ROOM - HOLLY JONES' HOUSE - DAY


Jones and his Aunt sit side by side on the couch -- the 
dog lying at Hollys feet.  Loki sits across from them on 
an ottoman.

                 LOKI
       So you didnt say anything to Mr. 
       Dover out on the parking lot 
       today?  Anything he could have 
       misinterpreted? 

Jones shakes his head.

                 LOKI 
       Nothing at all?  You didnt say, 
       get away from me?  Help?  Nothing 
       like that?

  
                 JONES
     No.

Loki nods, thinking.

                 LOKI
       Can I talk to Alex alone for a 
       minute?

She gives Alex a reassuring look, then gets up --

                 HOLLY JONES
       Ill be right in the next room, 
       Alex.


The dog gets up and follows after Holly as she exits the 
room.  Loki moves in a little closer to Jones.  Jones is 
afraid.  

                 LOKI
       Do you like your Aunt?

Jones doesnt answer at first, confused, but then:

 
                 JONES
      Yes.

                 LOKI
       You know if you know something 
       about what happened to these girls 
       and you dont tell us, your aunt 
       will go to jail too.  You want 
       that for her?  After she took care 
       of you all this time?  

Jones shakes his head, a little lost.  


EXT. HOLLY JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Loki walks to his car on the phone.

                 LOKI
           (into the phone)
       Mr. Dover, its Detective Loki.

INT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - THE DOVERS' HOUSE - 
CONTINUOUS

Keller stands in the hallway on his cellphone.


                 KELLER
           (into the phone)
       Have you arrested him?

                 LOKI 
           (over the phone)
       He said he didn't say anything in 
       the parking lot.  I pushed him 
       hard and he didn't budge.  We 
       cant waste any more time with 
       this guy.  Ill let you know when 
       I have something new.  Just hang --

Keller hangs up the phone, considering with desperate 
eyes.


INT. MASTER BEDROOM - THE DOVERS' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS


Keller walks in.  Ralph sits by Graces bedside looking 
freaked out.  She's holding on to him for dear life, 
hysterical; denial given way to manic terror.  

                 GRACE
       The zipper on her coat was broken, 
       and I told her it didn't matter, 
       that we were just going up the 
       street.  
           (to Keller)
       Why hasn't she come home?  Its 
       been three days.  Why can't you 
       make her come home?  I don't 
       understand.  It's been too long!

Keller motions to Ralph to get up and sits down next to 
Grace.  Ralph flees the room.  She motions to a bottle of 
Xanax on the bedside table.

                 GRACE 
       Give me two, I just want to be 
       knocked out.  I can't be awake 
       anymore.

Keller complies and she swallows the pills with trembling 
hands.  She lies back.  Keller strokes her hair.  She 
calms for a moment, then looks up at him accusingly.  

                 GRACE 
       You made me feel so safe.  You 
       said you could protect us from 
       anything.  

He starts to answer, but nothing comes out.  He looks 
sickened with shame, turning away from her stare, his 
eyes finally resting on a ticking clock...

INT. HALLWAY - THE DOVERS' HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Keller comes out of the bedroom.  Grace is sleeping.  
Ralph stands awkwardly in the dark hallway.

                 KELLER
       I'm going out to help the police.  
       Keep an eye on your mother.  

Ralph's been crying.  His eyes beg his father not to 
leave.

                 KELLER 
       Come on now, your sister needs us 
       to be brave for her.  You gonna be 
       brave -- be a grown-up for me?

Ralph doesnt answer.  Keller holds his stare for second, 
then just rushes past him.  But as Keller reaches the 
stairs, he stops, guilt creasing his face...he turns 
around, goes back and hugs his son.

                 KELLER 
       I know youre scared.  Its gonna 
       be OK. 

Crying now, Ralph holds on to his father for dear life.

EXT. DRIVEWAY - THE DOVERS' HOUSE - DUSK

Keller walks out the door and gets in his truck.

INT. KELLERS TRUCK - PARKED - CONTINUOUS

Keller turns the ignition key.  The Everyday Testament 
starts up.  He sits there, looking unsure of where hes 
going, a darkness clouding his visage...  

                 EVERYDAY TESTAMENT
       He reminds him that trouble and 
       affliction are what we have all 
       reason to expect in this world: 
       Man is brought to trouble --

He hits stop on the tape player.  Silence.  He slams 
the gear shift into drive and tears out of the driveway --

EXT. GUN HILL ROAD - NIGHT

A narrow lane lined with dead hedges and garbage.  
Kellers pick up truck pulls up across the street from 
HOLLY JONES HOUSE...

INT. KELLERS TRUCK - PARKED - CONTINUOUS

Keller turns off the engine and watches the little 
house...

INT. KELLERS TRUCK - PARKED - LATER 

Kellers eyes have lost some of their steely focus.  
He starts the truck, about to turn on his headlights 
when: 

The front door to the house opens, Holly Jones dog runs 
out and close behind it is Alex Jones holding the leash.

Jones walks it to the edge of the yard, checks to see if 
anyones watching, then lifts the dog by its leash and 
lets it dangle while he taunts it under his breath.

Keller looks sickened by the display, but stays in the 
truck.  Jones lowers the dog back to the ground.  And 
while it gasps for breath, Jones stares up at the sky and 
whistles a tune: 

Jingle Bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way --

Keller grips the steering wheel.  He takes a breath.  
And gets out of the truck...

EXT. HOLLY JONES' STREET - CONTINUOUS

Jones doesnt notice Keller stalking up behind him as he 
walks beyond the last working street light into the 
darkness.

 
                 KELLER
      Alex.

Startled, Alex turns around to see Keller aiming a pistol 
at his head.

                 KELLER 
       That song you were just whistling, 
       where did you hear it?

Jones drops the dogs leash to the ground and it runs 
off.  He doesnt look scared as much as quizzical, even 
when Keller presses the gun to his head.   

INT. JOYS ROOM - THE BIRCHES' HOUSE - DAWN

Joys gerbil runs through a habitrail.  Through the 
window: Kellers truck pulls up, HONKS.  Franklin jogs 
out of the house carrying a back pack and gets in the 
truck --

INT. KELLERS TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

Keller drives.  Franklin sits in the passenger seat, the 
backpack on his lap, looking supremely confused.

                 KELLER
       Did you bring a change of clothes 
       like I told you?

                 FRANKLIN
       Yeah, are you going to tell me 
       why?  

He notices Keller looks like grim death, eyes red.  
His knuckles are wrapped in gauze.  

                 KELLER
       Its better if I just show you.

Moments later.  They turn down a narrow side street lined 
with slummy two story apartment houses.  

Keller parks the truck and gets out.  Franklin doesnt 
move.

                 KELLER 
       Lets go.


Franklin reluctantly gets out of the truck...

EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Franklin follows Keller to the front door of a two story 
apartment house.  NO TRESPASSING.  LEAD POISON.  
CONDEMNED.  Theres a padlock on the front door.  Keller 
has a key.  

                 FRANKLIN
       You used to live here, didnt you?

Keller nods and Franklin follows him inside...

INT. SECOND FLOOR APARTMENT - APARTMENT HOUSE -CONTINUOUS

Keller and Franklin walk inside.  Wires hanging out of 
the ceiling.  Bare rafters.  Cold air blowing through.  

Franklin waits for an explanation.  Keller is looking 
around the place, like he sees things lurking in the 
shadows that Franklin cant.

A sound -- something CLANGING AGAINST A PIPE.

                 FRANKLIN
       Whats that?


Keller walks to the closed bathroom door.  He opens it, 
then steps aside, beckoning Franklin.  Franklin 
approaches...

A gutted bathroom.  JONES SITS IN THE SHOWER STALL, tied 
to a pipe jutting from a hole in the wall, his head down, 
duct tape over his mouth...

Franklin backs out of the room, pale-faced, he looks at 
Keller, shocked.

                 FRANKLIN 
       What the hell is this?  What did 
       you do, Keller?

Keller pulls him into the next room and gets in his face.

                 KELLER
       I heard him whistling the same 
       song they were whistling on 
       Thanksgiving.  I swear to God, 
       Franklin, the same fucking song.  
       And I told you what he said in the 
       parking lot.

                 FRANKLIN
       So we take him back to the cops.

                 KELLER
       Hell just clam up and act crazy 
       like he did last time.  Someone 
       has to make him talk.   

                 FRANKLIN
       What if youre wrong?  What if you 
       just heard what you wanted to 
       hear?  I want my daughter back as 
       much as you do, but this isnt 
       right. 

                 KELLER
       We hurt him until he talks or 
       theyre going to die.  Thats the 
       choice.  I know what I heard.    

Franklin looks back inside at Jones, perhaps thinking on 
what horrible things he might have done to his daughter, 
rage starting to take hold -- 

                 KELLER  
       Hes not a person anymore.  
       He stopped being a person when he 
       took our daughters.

Franklin turns to Keller, looking painfully conflicted.

                 FRANKLIN
       What about us?


Keller starts wrapping a rag tight around his knuckles.

                 KELLER
       Ill do whatever it takes.   

Franklins still face as he listens: Keller moving into 
the bathroom, then...SMACK.  Franklin winces, his face 
quivering  -- SMACK -- SMACK -- 

EXT. NEIGHBORS HOUSE - FAIRMOUNT CIRCLE - DAY


A WOMAN, 36, is sprinkling rock salt on her icy front 
steps, eyeing something across the street... 

The FOR SALE house, Loki walking around the yard, talking 
on his phone --

                 CAPTAIN RICHARD O'MALLEY 
           (over the phone)
       Results came back for the corpse 
       in the priests basement.  No DNA, 
       dental or fingerprint matches.  
       The priest is sticking to his 
       story; thinks he killed the next 
       Ted Bundy.

                 LOKI
           (into the phone)
       Probably his jilted lover or 
       something -- 

Loki catches the Woman across the street watching him, 
waves.

                 LOKI 
           (into the phone)
       I gotta go -- 

Loki hangs up -- starts across the street towards her --

                 WOMAN
       You talked to me already.

She gives him a flirtacious smile -- he smiles back --


                 LOKI
           (motions to empty 
            house)
       Forgot to ask -- did you know the 
       people who lived there?

                 WOMAN
       No -- they werent social.  Moved 
       to Easton a couple years ago.  
       Milland was their last name.

                 LOKI
       They know the girls families?

                 WOMAN
       Think they had some kind of 
       problem with the Dovers.  Dont 
       know what it was about.

Loki nods vaguely, looks back at the FOR SALE house...

EXT. THE MILLANDS HOUSE - DAY

Opening the door for Loki is KIM MILLAND, 37 -- a stiff 
looking woman with a mannered disposition.

                 LOKI
       Detective Loki.  Im investigating 
       the --

                 KIM MILLAND
       I know who you are.  My mother was 
       wondering when someone was going 
       to come see us.

Loki nods vaguely, a bit confused.

                 LOKI
       Because of where you used to live?

She makes a strange face, looks a little insulted -- 

                 KIM MILLAND
       Because of Barry.

INT. LIVING ROOM - THE MILLANDS HOUSE - DAY

Lokis POV of the TV: an old home video of Barry Milland, 
6.  Hes playing inside a big cardboard box/playhouse, 
staring out one of the cut-out windows.

                 MRS. MILLAND 
       Same person who took him took 
       those girls.  Im sure of it.  

The video starts to distort, the image deteriorating --

                 MRS. MILLAND  
       Oh Christ.  Im wearing out the 
       tape I guess.  I watch it everyday 
       after breakfast.  Its the only 
       video I have of him.  

Lokis gaze turns to the unblinking eyes of MRS. MILLAND, 
65, unable or unwilling to get up off the couch, her 
rotund frame draped in vertiginous patterns.  

                 MRS. MILLAND 
       It was before your time.  Twenty-
       six years ago.  August nineteenth.  
       I took a nap in the afternoon, and 
       when I woke up, Barry was gone.  
       No one could ever tell me what 
       happened to him.  He was playing 
       in the front yard -- a few feet 
       from where they say that RV was 
       parked...  What do you think that 
       means?  

Loki looks Mrs. Milland in the eye, trying to read her, 
then:  

                 LOKI
       Im more interested in what you 
       think it means.    

After a moment Mrs. Milland breathes out, shakes her 
head...

                 MRS. MILLAND
       I dont think well ever know...  
       Its just like Barry.  No one took 
       them -- nothing happened.  Theyre 
       just gone.

KIM MILLAND enters, 37, along with her brother ELLIOTT, 
35.  They orbit their mother like nervous nurses. 

                 MRS. MILLAND 
       Go ahead and search the house.  
       I know from experience how 
       precious time is to you right now.  
       Elliott will go with you, in case 
       you need to move something, he can 
       put it back.  He knows where 
       everything goes. 

INT. BEDROOM - THE MILLANDS HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Elliott shows Loki into a room filled with old toys and 
translucent storage containers stacked to the ceiling.

                 ELLIOTT MILLAND
       Everything Barry ever touched.  

Loki nods, seeing the old cardboard box/playhouse from 
the home video.  He weaves through the clutter towards 
it...  

                 LOKI
       You said you knew Anna Dovers 
       father when you lived on 
       Fairmount?

                 ELLIOTT MILLAND
       Not really knew him.  His son was 
       playing on our lawn one time -- 
       this was years ago -- and my 
       mother, she grabbed him and tore 
       his shirt a little.  She was 
       confused.  I stopped her and sent 
       the kid home.  Other than his 
       shirt he was fine.  Then an hour 
       later his father comes over and 
       starts threatening me -- obviously 
       drunk, but he seemed serious 
       enough.  I locked the doors and 
       waited for him to leave.  But he 
       didnt, he just sat there on our 
       front steps for over an hour.  
       Didnt leave until the cops came.   

While considering this Loki looks inside the playhouse.  
An old stuffed animal sits inside staring out at him.

EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE - NIGHT

The sun is gone.  A lone light in the second floor 
window...


INT. BATHROOM - SECOND FLOOR APARTMENT - NIGHT

Franklin braces Jones, keeping him standing while -- 
CRACK -- Keller slugs his bloodied face for what looks 
like the hundredth time.

                 KELLER
       Why?  Why wont you just fucking 
       tell us!?  

Jones head is hanging now, hes barely conscious.  
Keller motions for Franklin to wait a moment, walks out 
of the bathroom...

Franklin stands there holding Jones -- Keller walks back 
in.  Franklins face goes hard when he sees Keller is 
holding a hammer.  Franklin starts to say something when 
Keller silences him with a look --

Keller holds the hammer up in front of Jones -- Jones 
regarding it blankly --

                 KELLER 
       You gonna make me use this?  

Keller grabs Jones arm, forces his hand down on the 
sink, raises the hammer --

                 KELLER 
       Youre doing this to yourself.  
       Talk -- TALK!  

Jones eyes, like empty windows... 

KELLER BRINGS THE HAMMER DOWN -- HITS THE SINK -- 

Furious now, Keller slams Jones into the wall, looks like 
hes going to hit him in the face with the hammer -- 
Franklin moves in to stop him --

 
                 FRANKLIN
      STOP --

Keller smashes the hammer into the wall -- inches from 
Jones head.  Franklin pulls Keller back as Jones 
collapses to the floor...

INT. SECOND FLOOR APARTMENT - APARTMENT HOUSE - LATER


Keller unwraps the now bloodied rag from his knuckles 
while Franklin puts on a clean shirt.

                 FRANKLIN
       It doesnt seem like he even knows 
       whats happening to him.  

                 KELLER
       Thats what he wants you to think.  
       Its an act.  
           (beat)
       Well start up again in the 
       morning.

                 FRANKLIN
       Start what up again?  Its not 
       working.

                 KELLER
       Then well try something else.


EXT. FAIRMOUNT CIRCLE - NIGHT

Franklin walks up the street towards where the RV once 
parked.  Its alive with lights.  

He gets closer.  A candlelight vigil.  At least a hundred 
people, standing in the cold.  He walks past a reporter --  

                 REPORTER
       Four days have passed since Anna 
       Dover and Joy Birch were last seen 
       by their families.  The two girls, 
       age six and seven, are believed to 
       have been playing right here on 
       this street when they disappeared 
       without a trace.  As you can see, 
       despite the cold, a lot of people 
       have turned out tonight to show 
       their support.  Police are asking 
       that anyone who has any 
       information regarding the girls 
       whereabouts -- no matter how minor 
       -- to call the twenty-four hour 
       tip line.

He spots Nancy and Eliza and goes to them.

 
                 NANCY
      Hi.

He takes her hand, then Elizas...

                 NANCY 
           (whispers to 
            Franklin)
       Where have you been?

He doesnt answer.  All the lights are making him 
nauseous.

                 NANCY 
       Franklin?


                 FRANKLIN
       The woods, searching.

The lights are unbearable.  He lets go of their hands, 
reeling a little.

   
                 NANCY
    What is it?

                 FRANKLIN
       Nothing, Im OK.  Just need to sit 
       down.

As his wife and daughter walk after him, he sits down on 
someones lawn and tries not to throw up.  

Across the way we see Loki watching.  He turns -- 
scanning the crowd --  

Lokis POV -- somber, candlelit faces, breath showing in 
the cold, standing like a choir; all facing the same 
direction...

Except for A TALL MAN, whos staring at the Birches...

Loki starts carefully moving through the crowd...getting 
a better view of the Tall Man: pudgy, baby face, partly 
obscured by the hood of his parka --

Loki bumps into a woman -- knocks the candle from her 
hand -- 

                 WOMAN
       Watch it --


Loki looks over at the Tall Man -- their eyes lock -- 

The Tall Man turns abruptly, starts weaving out of the 
crowd  -- heads are turning -- a quiet commotion building 
when --

Loki gives up trying to be gentle -- shoves his way out 
of the crowd -- breaking into a run, the Tall Man about 
thirty yards ahead --

                 LOKI
       Stop right now!  Police!  

Lokis POV as he chases the Tall Man -- the Tall Man runs 
down into a ditch lining the roadside.  Loki sprints down 
after him -- losing sight of him when the Tall Man clears 
the other side --

Loki gets to the top of the slope, sees the Tall Man 
running between two houses --

Loki gives chase as the Tall Man runs out on to another 
street -- 

Lokis POV as he chases The Tall Man down the middle of 
the street -- the Tall Man veers off, runs up a hilly 
front yard and disappears behind a house --

Loki hits the hilly yard -- runs around the other side of 
the same house --

Loki peers around the corner of the house at the backyard 
-- nobody there.  Then he sees the motion lights come on 
next door -- hears a dog barking --

Loki draws his gun, heads to the chain link fence 
dividing the two backyards, steps over it, sees the 
leashed guard dog across the way, barking at something -- 

The dog notices Loki -- wheels around and charges him --  
until its leash goes taught and snaps it back --    

Loki breathes out, scans the yard.  No sign of the Tall 
Man.  Then --  

Something falls down to the ground beside Loki.  An 
icicle.  He looks up --  

Icicles hanging off the bottom of a tree house.  There 
could be someone up there -- its hard to tell from the 
ground -- its about ten feet up.  Loki aims his gun up 
at it...

                 LOKI 
       Hello?  You dont come down on 
       three, Im gonna start shooting.   
       One, two...three --


Nothing.  Loki breathes out, considering as the motion 
lights go dark -- 

A shape drops down from the tree house, Loki fires BANG, 
misses -- THUMP -- a boot hits his face, he falls back 
into the snow -- lights come back on as --

Loki scrambles up -- he dropped his gun -- sees the Tall 
Man is climbing over a wooden fence across the way -- 

Loki looks around in the snow for his gun -- there, grabs 
it -- aims -- the Tall Man is going over the fence -- 

 
                 LOKI 
      STOP!  

The Tall Man keeps going -- 

                 LOKI 
       Son of bitch!  

Loki runs to the fence -- climbs -- falls into a snow 
drift -- 

THE DIN OF ENGINES, CARS BLASTING PAST -- HES ON THE 
SIDE OF A HIGHWAY -- 

Loki peers through the blur of speeding cars to the other 
side -- no sign of the Tall Man.  

Struggling to catch his breath, Loki turns around, 
scanning, scanning -- 

Nothing.  Lokis about to loose his mind -- so fucking 
close. 

INT. TV ROOM - THE BIRCHS HOUSE - MORNING


The Birchs TV: a news report -- a police sketch on 
screen.  A fairly accurate rendering of the Tall Man --     

                 NEWS CASTER
       --who police are saying is a 
       person of interest in the 
       investigation of the two missing 
       girls --

Angle widens to reveal Franklin watching -- Nancy asleep 
on the couch.  The room hasnt been cleaned since 
Thanksgiving.  

Someone beeps their horn out front, startles Franklin -- 
he looks out the window.  Kellers truck just pulled up -- 

EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE - MORNING


Franklin follows Keller up the front stairs, theyre in 
the midst of a hushed argument --

                 FRANKLIN
       Why would the police be looking 
       for him if he didnt --

                 KELLER
       They did it together -- they know 
       each other.  I told you, Jones 
       looked me in the eye and told me: 
       they only cried when I left them.  
       He knows where this guy is.

Franklin tries to swallow that, but its not going 
down...  Keller leaves him on the stairs and disappears 
inside...

Franklin considers darkly...then after a moment he 
follows Keller inside, looking like hes being led to the 
gallows...

INT. CAPTAINS OFFICE - POLICE STATION - DAY

Loki walks in and drops something on O'Malley's desk. 
A little dog collar with ID tags on it.

                 LOKI
       Holly Jones dog.  Car hit it on 
       Southworth Street.  Turns out 
       Jones took it for a walk the night 
       before last and didn't come back.  
       His aunt didn't tell us until we 
       called her about the dog this 
       morning -- said she didn't want to 
       get him in trouble.  I thought we 
       were gonna keep him under 
       surveillance. 

                 CAPTAIN RICHARD O'MALLEY
       You said the runner at the vigil 
       is our guy.  I dont have money in 
       the budget for watching innocent 
       people.  

OMalley sees a sliver of doubt in Lokis eyes before 
Loki can conceal it.  Loki opens the door, and as he 
exits --

                 LOKI
       I just like knowing where 
       everybody is --  

INT. MEDIA ROOM - POLICE STATION - DAY

Loki sits in a broom closet of a room, stocked with 
outdated equipment.  Hes watching surveillance video 
from when he questioned Jones in the interrogation room:

                 LOKI
       Did you park your RV on Fairmount 
       Circle yesterday?

                 JONES
       I dont know the names.  The 
       street names, I dont look at 
       them. 

Loki shows pictures of Anna and Joy to Jones.

                 LOKI
       Have you seen these girls before?

Jones face as he looks at the pictures, unable to 
answer.  Nothing telling in his expression.  Just a man 
lost in his own world.  

A CLERK opens the door, awakens Loki from his trance -- 

                 CLERK
       Loki, you got a call.

INT. DISCOUNT DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY


Christmas music squawks as Detective Loki stands in the 
check-out line talking to JILL, 16, working the register.  

                 JILL
       I called as soon as I saw the 
       sketch on TV.  He comes in here 
       every week almost and buys kids 
       clothes, but hes always buying 
       stuff in different sizes.  Caught 
       him messing around with the 
       mannequins once. 

                 LOKI
       How did he pay?

                 JILL
       Cash.  

                 LOKI
       Heres my card.  If he comes back, 
       call me.


INT. SECOND FLOOR APARTMENT - NIGHT


Franklin, shivering in his underwear fumbles in his 
backpack for clean clothes.  Hes crying silently, wiping 
specks of blood off his face.

                 KELLER
       Were not done, Franklin.

Keller stands a few feet away, blood on his shirt, stone 
faced.  The closed door to the bathroom, Jones 
whimpering.  


                 FRANKLIN
       Well -- well come back later.  
       Need to get home.

                 KELLER
       Its been five days.  Maybe five 
       days since theyve had a drink of 
       water.  This could be the last 
       night that matters.  

                 FRANKLIN
       Ill call you after Nancy falls 
       asleep.  I promise. 

Keller looks dubious.


INT. KITCHEN - THE BIRCHES' HOUSE - NIGHT


Nancy pours Eliza a bowl of cereal, they both look 
exhausted.

                 NANCY
       Will you do me a favor and start 
       feeding your sisters gerbil?  
       Just until she comes back.   

Eliza nods.  Nancy pours the milk, sits down, her cold 
coffee waiting.  Eliza eats a cereal flake with her 
fingers.

The sound of Franklin coming in the front door.  Nancy 
gets up fast --


INT. VESTIBULE - THE BIRCHS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS


Franklin locks the front door as Nancy appears behind 
him.  

                 NANCY
       Do you know what time it is?  

He turns, snaps at her --

                 FRANKLIN
       Dont!  Just dont!

She stops, shocked by the way he looks, like hes aged, 
and his eyes -- staring through her.


EXT. THE DOVERS' HOUSE - NIGHT



With Franklin standing meekly behind her, Nancy rings the 
door bell over and over, until finally Keller opens the 
door.

Nancy glowers at Keller, trembling...

                 NANCY
       What the hell were you thinking?     

Keller gives Franklin the evil eye, then steps outside, 
closes the door behind him -- shoots Nancy a hard look...

                 KELLER
       You tell anyone?

Nancy shakes her head.  She looks at Franklin, her anger 
starting to collapse into a desperate hope...

                 NANCY
       I want to see him.

INT. KELLERS TRUCK - TRAVELING - NIGHT

Nancy and Franklin ride up front with Keller.  Keller 
pulls into a liquor store parking lot.

                 FRANKLIN
       Where are we going?

                 KELLER
       Cant keep parking in front -- 
       people are gonna notice.  
       Well walk from here.

EXT. LIQUOR STORE PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Keller, Nancy and Franklin exit the truck and walk 
silently across the parking lot.  A doll peeks out of 
Nancys purse...

INT. BATHROOM - SECOND FLOOR APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

The bathroom door opens.  Nancy walks in, alone, 
clutching her purse...  

Jones wrists are tied to a pipe in the shower.  His face 
is all but hidden; wrapped in blood soaked rags, just one 
eye peeks out...


Nancy doesnt scare easy; she moves in close and gets 
down to eye level with him...  

She pulls some pictures of Joy out of her purse and lays 
them out on the floor.  Then some drawings.  And finally 
the doll.  

                 NANCY
       This is her favorite doll.  
       She cant sleep without it.  

Nancy fights to keep from crying.  She looks to Jones, 
his cyclops eye staring blankly.

                 NANCY 
       She did these drawings.  Theyre 
       kind of sad, see.  She hasnt had 
       the easiest life. 

He starts to come to life a little; leaning over to get a 
closer look at the photos and drawings.  

                 NANCY 
       Please help her.

She stops and considers for a moment.  Then, with shaking 
hands, she starts to remove the rags from Jones head.  
His face is a horror.    

She peels the duct tape off Jones mouth, revealing the 
rag stuffed inside.  She pulls it out, then sets about 
untying his wrists from the pipe, freeing his mangled 
hands.   

Jones mouth starts moving.  Hes saying something... 
Nancy moves in closer, closer, until finally she gets the 
message:

     
                 JONES
  	elp me.

Jones grabs Joy's doll, stands up and backs away from 
Nancy, towards THE WINDOW...

Jones beats the doll's head against the window -- the 
glass shatters.  Nancy SCREAMS.  Keller and Franklin rush 
inside. 

                 KELLER
       You untied him?!

Jones is wriggling out the window, about to plunge three 
floors, when Keller grabs his legs and yanks him back in.


Jones grabs a shard of glass off the sill.  Keller gets 
his chest slashed as he grabs Jones' wrist and slams it 
into the wall repeatedly.  Jones drops the shard -- 

Shocked, Nancy watches Keller and Franklin struggle to 
tie Jones back up, trampling Joys belongings beneath 
their feet.


INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - POLICE STATION - NIGHT


Loki sits down across from Father Dunne.  Standing by the 
door is the seldom smiling DETECTIVE CHEMELINSKI, 43.

                 LOKI
       Detective Chemelinski said you had 
       some specifics about the crimes 
       you claimed this man committed.  
       The abductions.

                 FATHER PATRICK DUNN
       He was waging a war against God.

Loki shakes his head --

                 LOKI
       Great.
           (to Chemelinski)
       You told me he had something?

                 CHEMELINSKI
           (to Dunne)
       Tell him how he took the kids, 
       shitbird.  

Loki looks back to the priest, waiting...

                 FATHER PATRICK DUNN
       He said he took them in daylight.  
       Sometimes more than one child at a 
       time.  

Loki leans in, suddenly very interested.

     
                 LOKI
  	e said that?

 
                 FATHER PATRICK DUNN
      Yes.  

                 LOKI
       Did he mention an accomplice?  
       Any names?

  
                 FATHER PATRICK DUNN
       No.  But he said he had a family.  
       A wife and a son.

INT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - APARTMENT HOUSE - NIGHT

The closed door to the apartment.  Behind the door we 
hear the WHINE OF A BAND SAW REVVING UP.

INT. SECOND FLOOR APARTMENT - APARTMENT - NIGHT

Keller, leaned over the band saw lost in a cloud of saw 
dust as he slices through a piece of plywood.

He slams nails into wood with a nail gun, one after 
another, like the ticking of some two ton clock hand.  
Were too close to see what hes building...

INT. THE BIRCHES' HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Nancy stands in front of the humming microwave, zoning 
out as leftovers bubble and melt.  IT BEEPS.  The clock: 
2:05 am.  The door bell rings, jolts her --  

VESTIBULE

Nancy opens the door.  Its Keller.  Hes covered in 
sawdust.  

                 NANCY
       What is it -- what happened?

                 KELLER
       Get Franklin.  I need to show you 
       how it works.  


INT. SECOND FLOOR APARTMENT - APARTMENT HOUSE - NIGHT


Keller, Franklin and Nancy approach the closed bathroom 
door.  

                 FRANKLIN
       We need to let him go.

                 KELLER
       You said that already.

                 NANCY
       Has he said anything new?

                 KELLER
       He will.  Soon.  Youll see.

INT. BATHROOM - SECOND FLOOR APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

No sign of Jones, but where the shower used to be is a 
false wall made of wood: THE CELL.   

                 KELLER
       No light gets in, barely enough 
       room to sit down inside.  
       The shower still works, but we 
       control it from out here.  I 
       rigged the water heater, so it 
       either comes out scalding or 
       freezing.

He motions to two pipes jutting out of the cell, with 
faucet knobs on the end, cold and hot.

                 KELLER 
       Talk to him through this --

Keller motions to a PVC pipe jutting out, bent like an 
elbow.
Nancy leans in and listens: JONES IS INSIDE sobbing...

 
                 NANCY
      Oh my God.

Franklin notices a little picture of Anna and Joy tacked 
to the outside of the cell.

                 KELLER
       To remind us.  In case we start 
       feeling sorry for him.

Nancy and Franklin are stupefied.

                 KELLER 
       We cant hurt him any more without 
       killing him.  This is the only 
       way.  

                 FRANKLIN
       Are you out of your fucking mind?

INSIDE THE PITCH BLACK CELL 

Jones stops sobbing and quiets, listening to the muffled 
timbre of their voices...

BACK TO:

Keller, as he picks up a hammer and hands it to Franklin.  

                 KELLER
       You have a better idea?  Go ahead, 
       let him out if you want to.  
       I wont stop you.  If thats 
       really what you want, go ahead.

Franklin considers with harried eyes...    

                 KELLER 
       You think someone is looking out 
       for our girls the way youre 
       looking out for him?  Five days 
       theyve been gone now.  Were 
       running out of time. 

                 FRANKLIN
       We dont even know if hes the 
       guy, Keller.  

    
                 KELLER
   I do.

                 FRANKLIN
       I want my daughter back as much as 
       you do.  Id die for her -- but 
       this needs to end.

                 KELLER
       Then you better get to work.  
       Id start with that wall there.

Franklin looks to Nancy, but her eyes are lost.  He takes 
a breath, then goes to the cell, starting to pry at one 
of the walls with the hammer.  

After a few moments Nancy puts her hand on his shoulder --

                 NANCY
       Dont.  Franklin, stop.  

He shakes his head and keeps on prying at the wood, 
BREAKING OFF A SMALL PANEL --

SUDDENLY JONES REACHES OUT AND GRABS HIM.  Franklin drops 
the hammer.  NANCY SCREAMS as he yanks his arm from 
Jones grasp.

Franklin levels a long accusing stare at Keller.

                 NANCY 
       Lets just go.  Please.


Franklin finally heeds his wife and they leave Keller 
alone with his creation...

EXT. FRONT/BACK YARD - THE BIRCHES' HOUSE - NIGHT


An unseen persons POV, the INTRUDER, creeping across the 
Birches' moonlit backyard, moving towards...

THE BACK DOOR

The Intruders hand jimmying the lock with a screw 
driver...


INT. BATHROOM - THE BIRCHS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS


Eliza is taking a bath, talking on her cell phone to 
Ralph.  

                 ELIZA
           (into phone)
       I need to get out of here, Ralph.  
       Everything in this house makes me 
       want to throw up.
           (listening)
       Your Dads building?  Im not 
       staying in that crackhouse.  
       Gross.  

INT. HALLWAY - THE BIRCHS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Back to the Intruders POV, moving down the hallway: he 
stops at the closed bathroom door, listening to Elizas 
voice...

INT. MINIVAN - THE BIRCHES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Franklin pulls into the driveway, Nancy sitting in the 
passenger seat.  Both sit in silence for a moment, then:


                 FRANKLIN
       Kellers gonna kill him.  The guy 
       doesnt know anything, Nancy.  
       Hes just some poor fool who 
       parked on our street...  
           (beat)
       Im gonna go back there -- without 
       Keller -- let him out...    

                 NANCY
       Youre not going back to that 
       place.  

Franklin looks at her, not sure what shes getting at. 

                 NANCY 
       If you do, Ill call the police 
       and tell them everything.
           (beat)
       Were not gonna help Keller -- but 
       were not gonna stop him either.  
       Let him do what he thinks he needs 
       to...  
           (beat)
       We dont know about it anymore.    

And with that Nancy gets out and shuts the door -- 
leaving Franklin in shocked silence.


INT. HALLWAY - THE BIRCHES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS



Nancy walks down the hallway, stopping at the closed 
bathroom door.  She knocks.

 
She knocks again.

                 NANCY
      Eliza?

                 NANCY 
       Eliza?  You in there?

She tries the door.  Its locked.  Franklin comes up 
behind her.

                 FRANKLIN
       Whats the matter?

Nancy turns to him, terrified.

                 NANCY
       Shes not answering.

Franklins eyes go wide.  Nancy rattles the doorknob -- 
BANGS ON THE DOOR --

                 NANCY 
       Eliza, honey open the door.  
       Open the door, sweetheart -- Oh 
       Jesus -- 
           (screaming at 
            Franklin)
       Break it down!  Hurry up!

Franklin stands back, about to kick the door in when 
Eliza opens the door in a towel, hand over her cell 
phone.  

                 ELIZA
       Fuck you both.  Next time youre 
       going to leave me here alone -- 
       maybe you could try at least 
       telling me where youre going.

                 NANCY
       Im sorry, honey, we thought you 
       were sleeping -- we were at the 
       police station --

Eliza slams the door in their face.  

EXT. FAIRMOUNT CIRCLE - CONTINUOUS

Back to the Intruders POV: as he moves across the street 
to the Dovers' house.  Kellers truck isnt in the 
driveway.  
He moves around to the back of the house...

INT. HALLWAY - THE DOVERS' HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

The intruders POV: as he moves past the closed door to 
Ralphs room.  The muffled sound of him talking on the 
phone.  

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - THE DOVERS' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS


Grace lies in bed, sleeping, suddenly awakened as she 
hears a noise in the next room.  She sits up.

                 GRACE
       Anna?  Anna?


She gets out of bed...

INT. HALLWAY - THE DOVERS' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Grace moves slowly down the hallway.  She sees the door 
to Annas room is open...

INT. ANNAS ROOM - THE DOVERS' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Grace walks inside the room and turns on the light.  
Annas window is conspicuously open, curtains billowing.  

                 GRACE
       Anna?  I heard you.  Its Mommy, 
       honey.  Come out and see Mommy.

She stands there in the middle of the room, zoning out, 
her breath starting to show in the cold.  Ralph appears 
in the doorway, half asleep.

                 RALPH
       Ma, what are you doing?  
       Its freezing.

Ralph goes to the window.  He looks outside.  Nothing 
there.  He shuts the window --

INT. ANNAS ROOM - THE DOVERS' HOUSE - LATER

Loki follows a thoroughly drugged Grace into Annas room.

                 GRACE
       She was in here.  I heard her.  
       And when I came in, the window was 
       --

She starts to get dizzy.  Loki steadies her and sits her 
down on the side of the bed.

                 GRACE 
       She opened her window.  Ralph 
       closed it, but it was open before.
           (beat)
       Arent you going to write that 
       down?

Loki nods, and trying to do so with as little 
condescension as possible, pulls out his note pad and 
jots down: 
IN THE HOUSE?  OPEN WINDOW

                 GRACE  
       The basement.  I need to check the 
       basement.

INT. BASEMENT - THE DOVERS' HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Grace leads Loki down the stairs.  Loki looks around, a 
little taken aback by the floor to ceiling provisions.

While Grace searches for Anna, Loki notices a little 
sketch on Kellers work table: a stick figure in a box...  

Then he sees something else, among the provisions...a 
half used bag of lye.  He lingers on it for a moment.

                 LOKI
       Where is your husband, Mrs. Dover?

                 GRACE
       I was going to ask you.  He said 
       hes been helping the police look 
       for Anna.  

Loki looks dubious, thinking...

                 LOKI
       You think hell be back soon?

                 GRACE
       No.  Hes never home until late.

Loki looks at his watch: 3:45 am. 

INT. BLACK SEDAN - PARKED - DAY

Frozen rain comes down -- Loki squints out his windshield 
-- cant see anything.  He hits the wipers.  Now he can 
see again: he's parked up the street from the Dovers' 
house.

EXT. THE DOVERS' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Keller emerges from his front door and walks to his 
truck.  

INT. BLACK SEDAN - TRAVELING - CONTINUOUS

Loki drives, tailing Keller.  He yawns then pops a coffee 
bean into his mouth.  

He turns the police radio down and turns on the FM, 
tuning in a 50s pop song, tapping along, trying to stay 
alert.  

INT. KELLERS TRUCK - TRAVELING - CONTINUOUS

Keller listens to the Everyday Testament while he drives, 
fast forwarding, looking for something hes not finding, 
until it EATS THE TAPE.

EXT. LIQUOR STORE PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

Keller pulls into the parking lot -- 

EXT. LIQUOR STORE PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

Keller gets out of the truck and starts across the 
parking lot towards the apartment house.  

INT. BLACK SEDAN - PARKED - CONTINUOUS

Loki pulls to the side of the road, watching Keller 
trudge across the parking lot when a truck comes up 
behind him --

Loki waves him past, but the truck doesnt budge, BLARING 
HIS HORN --

        LOKI
       Shit.  Shit shit shit.

EXT. LIQUOR STORE PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS


Keller hears the trucks HORN BLARING.  He looks over and 
spots Lokis car.  

Keller freezes.  Hes busted; standing in the middle of a 
parking lot, nowhere near his truck, about to lead Loki 
to the apartment house.  

He grimaces, thinking.  He looks back over his shoulder.  
The liquor store MANAGER, 38, is raising the storefront 
security cage -- 

Keller does an about face, and starts walking back, 
veering towards the liquor store.  

INT. BLACK SEDAN - PARKED - CONTINUOUS

Loki watches, baffled, as Keller walks into the liquor 
store.

EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

The freezing rain begins turning to snow.  Lokis side 
mirror reflects cars passing as he waits for Keller to 
come out of the liquor store.    

INT. BLACK SEDAN - PARKED - MOMENTS LATER

Loki watches as Keller walks from the liquor store, paper 
bag in hand, making a bee line for Lokis car.  Loki 
shakes his head; he cant believe this guy.  


As he approaches, Keller pulls the bottle from the paper 
bag, unscrews the cap and takes a slug...

EXT. LIQUOR STORE PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

Keller knocks on Lokis passenger side window.  Loki puts 
the window down...    

                 KELLER
       Why are you following me?

INT. BLACK SEDAN - PARKED - CONTINUOUS

Loki leans over the seat and opens the door.  

                 LOKI
       Sit down.


Keller takes his time, but he does as hes asked and gets 
in.  He sits there and takes another long haul of 
whiskey.

                 LOKI 
       Youve got a bag of lye in your 
       basement thats half gone.  And 
       your wife thinks youve been out 
       helping us -- which we both know 
       isnt true.  

Keller shakes his head in bitter disbelief, breathes out:

                 KELLER
       Used the lye to bury our dog last 
       year.  And helping the cops sounds 
       better than Ive been driving 
       aimlessly in my truck, cause I 
       dont know what the fuck else to 
       do.

                 LOKI
       Is that what you were doing on 
       Saturday night?  

 
                 KELLER
      Probably.

                 LOKI
       Im asking because you assaulted a 
       man who is now missing.  

                 KELLER
       I heard.  So what happened to him?

                 LOKI
       I assume the fact youre asking 
       means you dont know.

                 KELLER
       I didnt think it was something I 
       could get away with.

  
                 LOKI
     Its not.

                 KELLER
       Couldnt be that he skipped town 
       cause the asshole is guilty, nah 
       couldnt be that, cause that 
       would be your fault, wouldnt it?  

                 LOKI
       Where were you going just now?

                 KELLER
           (raises the bottle)
       To get this.

                 LOKI
       No, before that.  You were walking 
       in the other direction, across the 
       parking lot towards Campello 
       Street.  

Keller drinks some more, stalling, until:

                 KELLER
       I havent had a drink in a long 
       time.  I figured if I walked 
       around the parking lot for a 
       while, by the time they opened Id 
       stop wanting it so bad.  Then I 
       saw you, and that sort of helped 
       make up my mind.  

Loki stares into Kellers eyes, finding no apparent trace 
of falsity, just undeniable sadness.  Keller offers the 
bottle to Loki.  Loki shakes his head.

                 LOKI
       Your little girl will need you 
       when she comes home, Mr. Dover.  
       You and your wife need to take 
       care of yourselves, thats the 
       best thing you can do for her 
       right now.

                 KELLER
       Thanks for the tip.
           (guzzles some 
            whiskey)
       I heard kids gone for more than a 
       week have half as good a chance of 
       being found.  And after a month 
       almost none are.  Not alive.

Beat.  A heavy quiet...the falling snow...

                 LOKI
       It hasnt been a week yet.

Keller starts to get out, but before he closes the door --

                 LOKI 
       You dont think Im going to let 
       you get behind the wheel of an 
       automobile after youve been 
       drinking -- in the middle of a 
       blizzard.  Let me drive you home.  

                 KELLER
       Im gonna walk.

Keller shuts the door, and Loki watches as he walks off 
into the white blur of falling snow.

EXT. THE DOVERS' HOUSE - DUSK

Keller trudges up his driveway, completely drunk, half 
frozen.  He tosses the now empty bottle of whiskey into a 
snow drift.


INT. BEDROOM - THE DOVERS' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Keller walks in.  Grace is passed out in bed.  He takes 
his boots off, almost falling over in the process.  

Then he crawls into bed with his clothes on, his 
bloodshot eyes fluttering closed...

CUT TO:

INT. KELLERS DREAM - BEDROOM - NIGHT - THE DOVERS' HOUSE

Keller opens his eyes to see ANNA STANDING BY THE SIDE OF 
THE BED.  Hes too shocked to speak.  She holds up a red 
whistle. 

                 ANNA
       Look, Daddy!  We found it!  
       We found it!  It was at the bottom 
       of the Brewers pool!     

Keller sits up, eyes tearing, reaching for her --

BACK TO:

INT. BEDROOM - THE DOVERS' HOUSE - MORNING

Keller wakes up aghast, and still a little drunk.  He 
thinks for a moment -- staring at the spot where Anna 
stood in his dream, when suddenly his face goes hard with 
fright --  

 
                 KELLER
      No -- no --

He jumps out of bed --


INT. DEN - PAUL BREWERS HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

BILL BREWER, 8, stares through a sliding glass door at 
the pool area in his back yard.  Hes intently watching 
something we cant yet see...

                 BILL
       Mom, theres a man in our yard.

JANE BREWER, 29, still in pajamas, coffee in hand, walks 
up behind Bill --

                 JANE
       Come eat your breakfast, Bill.  

She looks out the glass door, and drops her coffee.  

                 JANE 
           (calling into the 
            next room)
       Paul!  PAUL!

EXT. POOL AREA - PAUL BREWERS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Paul, in boots and pajamas, slowly slides open the glass 
door, frightened eyes locked on...

The pool.  Someones dragged part of the pool cover off.  
Paul walks up to the pools edge, his wife and son 
watching through the glass door in the background...
Baffled, Paul stares down at the exposed icy green water 
when suddenly -- KELLER BURSTS TO THE SURFACE, SUCKING 
AIR --

Paul almost has a heart attack, backing away, eyes wide, 
as Keller climbs out of the pool, shivering, skin blue -- 

                 PAUL
       Keller?  What the hell is going 
       on?

Keller doesnt answer, his eyes look like theyre still 
dreaming.  He lumbers away without a word, while Paul and 
his family watch on in shocked disbelief.

Paul takes a look in the water to see if hes missing 
something.  But all he sees is a pool full of ice and 
leaves.

EXT. RIVERBANK - MORNING

We move over the river -- two police boats deploying 
divers -- search and rescue dogs roaming the shoreline -- 
search teams moving into the adjacent woods...

INT. LOKIS DESK - CONYERS POLICE STATION - DAY

Loki, stares at his computer screen, perplexed.  Hes 
been here all night and looks it.  He grabs his bag of 
coffee beans -- sees its empty -- tosses it aside --

The CAPTAINS SECRETARY, 29, walks by drinking coffee.

                 CAPTAINS SECRETARY
       You need a shower, Loki.  

Loki waves her away.  On screen: a newspaper article.  
A picture of Kellers Dad.  The headline: GRATERFORD 
GUARD COMMITS SUICIDE IN HOME

Loki scans the article, eyes resting on an address: 
234 Campello Street, apt 3

He remembers something and gets up, gets his coat on --

EXT. LIQUOR STORE PARKING LOT - DAY

Keller walks across the parking lot towards his truck, 
still parked where he left it the previous day...and 
right past it, on to the apartment house...

INT. BATHROOM - SECOND FLOOR APARTMENT - DAY

The cell, the sound of the SHOWER BLASTING INSIDE.  Steam 
rises from the PVC pipe as Jones BANGS ON THE INSIDE --

Keller turns it off.  He looks close to tears -- hitting 
his breaking point...when he hears something -- Jones 
mumbling something over and over again:

                 JONES
       ...not Alex.  Im not Alex.  Im 
       not him -- Im not Alex -- 

Hearing Jones voice gives Keller a burst of adrenaline -- 

                 KELLER
       What do you mean?  Who are you 
       then?  Come on -- talk to me.

                 JONES
       ...Im not him, not him --

Jones words fragment into gibberish -- Keller punches 
the outside of the cell -- 

                 KELLER
       You ARE him -- this IS happening.  
       All you need to do to make it stop 
       is tell me where they are.  

No response.  Just a horrible dripping sound...  Keller 
takes a breath, then:

                 KELLER 
       Dont make me do this anymore.    

Keller reaches to turn the water back on, but he cant -- 
tears crawling down his face as he mouths: Im sorry -- 
He kneels down.  Squeezes his hands together.  And after 
a moment starts to mutter what sounds like a prayer --

EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Loki's car pulls up in front of the apartment house.  He 
gets out and observes the building from the street, 
considering...

INT. BATHROOM - SECOND FLOOR APARTMENT - DAY

Keller stands up -- takes a breath, looks over at the 
cell... 

EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Loki observes the padlock on the front door IS HANGING 
UNCLAMPED.  Someones inside.  He thinks for a second, 
then clamps the padlock shut.

INT. BATHROOM - SECOND FLOOR APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Keller is about to turn the hot water back on when he 
hears something outside.  He goes to the bathroom window, 
looks down into the back alley and sees:

Loki trying to remove the board from a low lying window --

 
                 KELLER
      Fuck me.

INT. STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

Keller jumps down flights of stairs, making a mad dash 
for...  

THE FRONT DOOR TO THE BUILDING

Keller tries the door, BUT LOKIS PADLOCKED THE OUTSIDE --

INT. FIRST FLOOR APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Keller enters, frantic.  One of the boards covering the 
windows is being pried from the outside -- but it's still 
in place, Loki has yet to see inside.  

Keller lays his coat out like a blanket and lies down on 
top of it, pretending hes been sleeping here all night --

Loki gets the board off the window.  He pokes his head 
inside and sees Keller lying there on the floor.  

Loki climbs in.  Then he walks to Keller and toes his 
ribs with his shoe.

                 LOKI
       Rise and shine.

Keller opens his eyes, pretends to look surprised, plays 
up the hangover.

                 LOKI 
       I knew you were headed over this 
       way.  Im not going to find two 
       little girls in this building am 
       I, Mr. Dover?  

                 KELLER
       Fuck you.


                 LOKI
       What about Alex Jones?  

                 KELLER
       What about him?  I came here to 
       drink.  Didnt want to do it in 
       front of my wife.  My father left 
       me this building.

Loki considers.

                 LOKI
       Mind giving me the tour?

Loki motions to the door.  Keller breathes out and gets 
up.

INT. STAIRWELL - APARTMENT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Keller walks up the stairs, panic in his eyes, Loki a few 
steps behind him.

                 LOKI
       Why didnt you tell me about this 
       place?

                 KELLER
       Didnt think it mattered.

                 LOKI
       Everything matters.   


INT. SECOND FLOOR APARTMENT - APARTMENT HOUSE - 
CONTINUOUS

Keller walks inside the apartment, Loki follows, looks 
around, CLAPS HIS HANDS a couple times to wake himself up 
-- Keller flinches -- 

                 LOKI
       All that survival gear in your 
       basement, you know something the 
       rest of us dont?

                 KELLER
       Pray for the best.  Prepare for 
       the worst.

Loki nods condescendingly.  

INT. STAIRWELL - APARTMENT HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER


Loki follows Keller up the stairs to the second floor.  
Keller slows the ascent, desperate, doesnt know what to 
do --

                 LOKI
       Come on, hurry up --

Lokis PHONE RINGS -- 

EXT. PARKING LOT - DISCOUNT DEPARTMENT STORE - CONTINUOUS


Jill the check out girl watches as a little junker of a 
car takes off out of the parking lot, shes out of breath 
--

                 JILL
           (into the phone)
       The guy youre looking for was 
       just here.  He saw me watching him 
       and ran.

                 LOKI 
           (over the phone)
       Get his plates?

INT. STAIRWELL - APARTMENT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Loki rushes past Keller up the stairs to the second floor 
as Jill gives him the plates...

Keller freezes, going out of his mind as he listens to 
Loki's ECHOING FOOT FALLS...  

Until they suddenly stop.  HE'S AT THE DOOR.  Keller 
takes a breath and bounds up the rest of the stairs, just 
in time to see Loki disappear into the apartment -- 

INT. SECOND FLOOR APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Loki walks inside, hangs up his phone and takes a quick 
look, rushing, distracted.  THE DOOR TO THE BATHROOM IS 
OPEN, but the light is out.  Jones is silent and from 
where Loki is standing...

The cell looks like just another unfinished wall.  Loki 
turns around and rushes out --

INT. HALLWAY - THE APARTMENT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Loki walks out into the hall.  Keller is waiting for him, 
ready to be busted.  But then Loki just rushes right past 
him, barreling down the stairs --

                 LOKI 
       Go home, Mr. Dover.

Keller stands there dumbstruck.  Then he walks to the 
open apartment door and looks inside across the way at 
the open bathroom door, realizing his good luck...

EXT. FRONT DOOR - BOB TAYLORS HOUSE - DAY

Loki pushes a doorbell and waits.  Someones made a snow 
angel in the front yard.  Loki stares at it, lost in 
thought until the door opens --

                 BOB TAYLOR
       Hi.

The man from the candlelight vigil: BOB TAYLOR, 39.  Loki 
gives him a big smile, shows him his badge.

                 LOKI
       Why did you run away from me the 
       other night?

                 BOB TAYLOR
       Ive never seen you before.  You 
       sure you got the right house?    

                 LOKI
       You done any shopping at AJ Sax 
       lately?

                 BOB TAYLOR
       Yeah, why is it a crime to shop 
       there?  
           (motioning to Lokis 
            suit)
       I dont have the money to shop at 
       Brooks Brothers.

                 LOKI
       You bought childs clothing.

                 BOB TAYLOR
       Did I?  I must have been in a 
       hurry.

                 LOKI
       Do you have any children?


Bob pauses, slowly shaking his head.

                 BOB TAYLOR
       No...I dont have anything.

Loki gets his foot in the door jam, starts trying to push 
his way in as Bob braces against the door --

INT. VESTIBULE - BOB TAYLORS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Loki shoves the door open.  He grabs Bob, slams him into 
some shelves knocking them down -- then slams Bob face 
first into the floor, breaking his nose.  Loki cuffs his 
hands behind his back and forces him to lie on his 
stomach.

                 LOKI
       Your nose leaves that floor I will 
       shoot you.

Loki gets on his phone as he starts checking the houses 
interior.

                 LOKI 
       Need a rescue unit at 437 Carrol 
       Street -- possible kidnap victims 
       on the premises.  

Lokis POV: mazes are drawn on the walls and cut-out of 
the carpets...

KITCHEN

Theres something in the kitchen sink: flies buzzing all 
around it.  Loki walks to the sink and sees some hair...    

He looks closer, covering his mouth as he steps to the 
sink and looks inside.  A pigs head, wearing a wig.  

HALLWAY

Loki moves down the hallway -- stops at an open door.  A 
cluttered room -- a cage full of mice...  

Loki continues down the hall, comes to a closed door.  
Its locked --   

EXT. LOKIS SEDAN - PARKED/BOBS HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Loki throws a cuffed Bob Taylor into the back of his car, 
slams the door -- pops his trunk, grabs a crowbar --

INT. HALLWAY - BOB TAYLORS HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Loki pries at the locked door with the crowbar -- the 
wood splinters -- the door pops open, revealing...

A small room. 

Lokis POV as the door swings in: stacked high against 
the wall are SIXTEEN HEAVY DUTY PLASTIC CONTAINERS --

Lokis jaw drops.  He struggles to take one down.  Its 
heavy, and locked.  

Loki PRIES THE LOCKED CLASP WITH THE CROWBAR until it 
breaks.  He flips it open.  Some bloody kids clothes.  
THERES SOMETHING MOVING UNDERNEATH...

Loki reaches inside.  A SNAKE RISES UP -- HISSING --

                 LOKI
       Shit -- fuck --

LOKI SLAMS IT CLOSED.  

Loki takes a breath, then in a mad blur he takes down 
another container and another, using the crowbar to break 
the locked clasps, flipping the tops open --

More bloody kids clothes -- more SNAKES.  More plastic 
containers to open -- 

Moments later hes dripping with sweat, surrounded by 
open containers, snakes everywhere.  Just one to go...

Out of breath, Loki breaks the lock and opens it...

Inside is a homemade book.  Scrawled on its cover: 
IF YOU FINISH ALL THE MAZES YOU CAN GO HOME

INT. HALLWAY - POLICE STATION - DAY


Keller sits on a bench.  A SQUEALING door opens.  
Franklin bursts out, horrified and rushes past him down 
the hall.  Then Nancy comes out in tears, her eyes meet 
Kellers for a moment, stunning him --

Keller stands up, getting freaked out.  Nancy rushes down 
the hall, sobbing, rushing after Franklin.  

Loki stands in the doorway looking shaken up.  

                 LOKI
       Mr. Dover?  Your wife here?

Nancys sobbing is still audible, until she exits into 
the parking lot with Franklin and the DOOR SLAMS behind 
them.

                 LOKI 
       Mr. Dover?


                 KELLER
       Shes not coming.

Loki nods, considering.

                 LOKI
       Alright.  But if you cant make a 
       positive ID...shes going to need 
       to come in and take a look at 
       this.

INT. EVIDENCE ROOM - POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS

A banged up table covered with evidence bags, all 
containing different articles of bloody childrens 
clothing.  

Loki watches on as Keller stares down at the bagged 
clothes.

                 KELLER
       He confessed?  He said he killed 
       them?

                 LOKI
       We had hoped he was lying -- we 
       didnt find any bodies, but, Mr. 
       Dover...

Loki is absorbing Kellers dread, struggling to continue:

                 LOKI 
       The Birches just positively IDd 
       two of these as belonging to their 
       daughter.  
           (beat)
       Do you recognize anything?

Keller looks over the bags, his body going cold as he 
picks one up and looks at the shredded shirt inside.  He 
gently sets it down, relieved.  

Another bag, as he picks it up and inspects a bloody 
sleeve ripped from a little coat.  Another sigh of relief 
-- and then as he sees whats beneath it...

A lone sock with a bunny face on it.  Keller picks it up.  
His hands are shaking.

                 LOKI 
       Mr. Dover?


Suddenly Keller grabs Loki and slams him against the 
wall.  

                 KELLER
       You wasted time -- you wasted time 
       following ME!  YOU LET THIS 
       HAPPEN!  

Loki shoves him off.  Plays it tough. 

                 LOKI
           (bellicose)
       I did everything I could.

                 KELLER
       Keep telling yourself that.  

Keller walks out and SLAMS THE DOOR -- 

Loki looks down at the bloody sock in the plastic bag.  
He lingers on it guiltily, perhaps imagining how it came 
to be here...

Loki seems to lose himself for a moment, his face going 
sick...

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - THE DOVERS' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Keller opens the door, looking in on Grace, passed out in 
bed.  He watches her for a moment, his face like that of 
some malfunctioning robot...

INT. ANNAS ROOM - THE DOVERS' HOUSE - DAY

Ralph sits on his sisters bed in shock, holding his cell 
phone.  He looks up as Keller walks inside and goes to 
the window.  There are two news vans parked out front.  

                 KELLER
       Dont talk to them.

Ralph stands up.

                 RALPH
       Eliza told me theyre dead.  
           (beat)
       Is it true?

Keller doesnt turn from the window.  

                 KELLER
       No.


                 RALPH
       But she said they found their -- 
       their bloody clothes.

Keller swings around, grabs Ralph and shakes him --

                 KELLER
       Dont you tell your mother that.  
       Dont you dare tell her that.  
       You understand me?  

Ralphs goes rigid, his eyes burn into Keller's.

                 KELLER 
       I want you to listen to me.  I 
       need you to stay around the house 
       for the next couple days, make 
       sure she doesnt see the news -- 
       when the paper comes throw it the 
       fuck away.  We dont give up on 
       your sister -- Im gonna find her 
       and bring her home.  We do not 
       give up on her, you understand?  

Ralph's shakes his head, raging -- 

                 RALPH
       You're gonna bring her home?  
       She's dead, you can't do anything.  
       You left me and Mom here while you 
       went out and got fucking drunk.  
       You think I can't smell it on you?

Keller grabs Ralph and slams him into the wall, knocking 
over a dollhouse.  He holds him there for a second, until 
the madness drains out of his visage and he finally lets 
go.

Ralph just stands there, holding his ground, jaw 
clenched.

Keller can't look at him now.  He exits.  Ralph breathes 
out. 


INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - POLICE STATION - NIGHT


Loki and OMalley watch through the two-way mirror as a 
shackled and bandaged Bob Taylor draws on a large piece 
of paper with a crayon.  He appears to be drawing an 
insanely dense maze.


                 CAPTAIN RICHARD O'MALLEY
       How long has he been working on 
       this...map?

Loki looks at his watch wearily.

                 LOKI
       Three and a half hours.

                 CAPTAIN RICHARD O'MALLEY
       You think its gonna lead you to 
       the bodies?  Cause I sure as shit 
       dont.  

                 LOKI
       No offense, Captain, but go fuck 
       yourself.  We werent getting 
       anywhere questioning him.  

OMalley shakes his head, moving in closer until his nose 
is against the glass.

                 CAPTAIN RICHARD O'MALLEY
       Looks more like a maze than a map.

                 LOKI
       Hes got a thing for mazes.

OMalleys seen enough.  He goes to exit.

                 CAPTAIN RICHARD O'MALLEY
       Im going home.  Call me if 
       something happens.


INT. HALLWAY - POLICE STATION - LATER

Its late.  Wedge and Carter stand guard outside a closed 
door.  Loki walks towards them, popping a coffee bean in 
his mouth.  He looks like hes ready to blow.

                 LOKI
       Open the door.


Loki unholsters his gun and hands it to Carter --

                 CARTER
       Captain said to call him before 
       letting anybody in.

                 LOKI
       I just talked to him.  He said it 
       was fine.  But if you want to call 
       and wake him up again, go ahead.

Wedge and Carter look at each other, then Wedge swipes a 
pass key over a sensor unlocking the door with a BEEP --


INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - POLICE STATION - LATER

Loki walks inside and shuts the door.  Bob is still 
working on his maze.  

                 LOKI
       I think its done now.

Loki grabs the crayon out of his hand --  

                 LOKI 
       Tell me what Im looking at.

Bob looks conflicted, considering, and then:

                 BOB TAYLOR
       I cant.

Loki grabs the back of Bobs head and SMASHES HIS ALREADY 
BROKEN NOSE INTO THE TABLE --

                 LOKI
       You said youd draw a map, not a 
       fucking puzzle.  Tell me what Im 
       looking at.

Bob starts to cry --

                 BOB TAYLOR
       I cant -- 

Loki throws him to the floor -- gets on top of him -- 

                 LOKI
       Yes.  You can.


Wedge and Carter burst in, scrambling to pull Loki off of 
Bob.  BOB GRABS WEDGES GUN FROM ITS HOLSTER -- 

                 LOKI 
       HES GOT YOUR GUN --

Carter draws his gun as Bob, shackled, both hands 
gripping the gun, backs up against the two way mirror --

                 CARTER
      DROP IT!  

                 LOKI
       Bob, put the gun down.  

Bob brings the gun up to his chin in a quick motion --

                 LOKI 
       NO!


Loki and Carter rush him -- BANG -- Bob falls to the 
floor, dead.  Loki, Wedge and Carter just stand there in 
shock.  

INT. DANDELION ANIMAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Darkness.  The front door opens, Nancy enters, punches a 
code into the alarm keypad, keys jingling --

She hits the lights and rushes down a hallway to a supply 
closet.  She fumbles through her keys with trembling 
hands, her breath quickening.  She gets it open, takes a 
breath --

INT. SECOND FLOOR APARTMENT - APARTMENT HOUSE - NIGHT


The closed front door to the apartment as someone KNOCKS -
-

Keller rushes out of the bathroom, his heart in his 
throat as the front door swings open.  Its Nancy Birch, 
clutching a white paper bag.

Keller breathes out, relieved.  She slowly makes a bee 
line for the closed bathroom door.

                 KELLER
       Why are you here?

She opens the bathroom door and peers inside.  A cold 
washes over her.

                 NANCY
       I was praying you had ended this 
       already.  

She grimaces, thinking to herself, checking something 
over in her mind.  Finally she holds up the white paper 
bag weakly.  

                 NANCY 
       I got it from work.  
           (beat)
       We use it to -- to put down 
       animals.  

                 KELLER
       Jesus.  Just like that, huh?

                 NANCY
       You started this.  You went and 
       took him.  Got Franklin involved.  
       This isnt your decision to make.  
       You and Franklin will go to jail -- 
       I could go to jail.  And then what 
       will happen to Eliza?  I need to 
       protect whats left of my family, 
       Keller.
           (motions to the 
            bathroom)
       Hes beyond help anyway.   

She shoves the bag into Kellers hand, looks away and 
starts to cry bitterly.

                 KELLER
       They found some clothes -- they 
       havent found the bodies.  Im not 
       giving up.  Im not having 
       Christmas without my daughter.  

                 NANCY
       They had Joys bloody pants in a 
       plastic bag for Christs sake!  
       What do you think that means?

She breaks down and puts her head on his chest, sobbing, 
holding on to him for dear life.

                 NANCY 
       I can hear him -- anytime its 
       quiet -- I can hear him trying to 
       get out, can smell him on my 
       clothes.  You have to make it 
       stop.  

She steps back, wiping the tears from her face, trying 
vainly to calm herself down as she turns and walks to the 
exit...

                 NANCY 
       And when its done, burn this 
       place.

The door shuts, shes gone.  Its quiet.  Just Keller and 
the white paper bag in his hands...

INT. BATHROOM - SECOND FLOOR APARTMENT - LATER

Keller sits on the floor across from the cell, guzzling 
whiskey from his coffee thermos.  He sets down the 
thermos. Picks up the white paper bag, peers inside...
A little white box branded with a skull and crossbones. 

After a moment he tosses the bag aside.  Picks the 
thermos back up, takes another pull when --

A scratched whisper comes from the PVC pipe:

                 JONES 
       Theyre in the maze.

Keller freezes.  His face goes dead.  

                 JONES   
      In the maze.

                 KELLER
       What?  
           (beat)
       What did you say?

                 JONES 
       Thats where youll find them.

Keller goes to the cell, speaking into the PVC pipe:

                 KELLER
       What maze?  Where is it?  How do I 
       get there?  Its OK, Im gonna get 
       you out of there.  Just tell me 
       where the maze is.

Keller waits and waits, the tension building to an 
excruciating crescendo...until JONES STARTS TO LAUGH.  

Keller, enraged, BEATS ON THE CELL WITH HIS FISTS, 
SCREAMING:

 
                 KELLER 
      TELL ME!  

No response.  Keller steadies himself.

                 KELLER 
       Somethings gonna get to you.  

INT. HALLWAY - POLICE STATION - NIGHT 


Loki is asleep, slumped on a bench in the now clamorous 
hallway.  O'Malley walks over and gives Loki's foot a 
hard kick -- 

Loki springs awake as Taylor's corpse is rolled out of 
the adjacent interrogation room.  O'Malley shoves 
Taylor's blood spattered maze drawing into Loki's hand --

                 CAPTAIN RICHARD O'MALLEY
       He explain this before he ate the 
       bullet?

Loki takes the drawing weakly, shaking his head.

 
                 LOKI
      I'm sorry --

                 CAPTAIN RICHARD O'MALLEY
       Fuck youre sorry.  Save it for 
       the girls' parents.

EXT. HOLLY JONES HOUSE - DAY

Keller rings the bell.  Listens.  He hears someone moving 
around inside, TVs on --

                 HOLLY JONES 
       Just a minute.

Holly Jones opens the door.  Kellers shaky, struggling 
to act normal.

                 HOLLY JONES 
       Can I help you?

                 KELLER
       Good morning Ma'am.  Im Keller 
       Dover.

                 HOLLY JONES
       Im sorry, youre who?

                 KELLER
       My little girl was abducted with 
       her friend --

She recognizes him and steps back, starting to close the 
door, fear in her eyes.

                 HOLLY JONES
       What do you want?  

                 KELLER
       Im sorry, I guess I didnt think 
       this through too good.  Ive just 
       been thinking a lot about what 
       happened with your nephew.  I know 
       I scared him that day at the 
       police station.  I guess what Im 
       trying to say is I feel 
       responsible for him running away.

She studies him, the act of which seems to be giving her 
a headache.

                 HOLLY JONES
       Would you like to come in?

INT. KITCHEN - HOLLY JONES' HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Its a quaint little nook.  Keller sits at the table, 
keeping his bandaged knuckles out of sight.  Across from 
him sits Holly Jones.  She drinks tea.  

                 HOLLY JONES
       My husband and I were very devout 
       at one time.  Spent our summers, 
       driving around in that RV with our 
       son -- handing out pamphlets, 
       spreading the good word.  But 
       after our son died of cancer we 
       started seeing things differently.  
       Adopting Alex helped, but we never 
       got over it.  

Keller shakes his head sympathetically.  

                 HOLLY JONES 
       You look very tired.

                 KELLER
       I dont sleep much.  Keep dreaming 
       about being lost in a maze.

Keller watches for her reaction to his mention of the 
word, but she doesnt react whatsoever.  Instead theres 
a long, awkward silence, until:

                 HOLLY JONES
       Im sorry, Alex never talked much, 
       so I hardly know what to say to 
       people when they come here.

Keller waits for her to go on, and when she doesnt.

                 KELLER
       He doesnt talk much?

                 HOLLY JONES
       He talks.  Good morning, good 
       night, things like that, but its 
       hard to get much more than that 
       out of him.  He had an accident 
       when he was little.  After that he 
       started choosing his words a 
       little too carefully.

                 KELLER
       What kind of accident?

                 HOLLY JONES
       My husband kept snakes.  It wasnt 
       so bad what happened, but Alex had 
       a fear of them, and...  
           (she trails off)
       Its not my favorite memory.  

                 KELLER
       Im sorry, its none of my  
       business.

                 HOLLY JONES
       You know you remind me of him a 
       little -- my husband.
 
                 KELLER
       Oh?

                 HOLLY JONES
      Its the eyes.

She stares into his eyes for a moment, making him 
noticeably uncomfortable.  He looks down, sees a 
newspaper on the table: TAYLOR COMMITS SUICIDE, LOCATION 
OF BODIES STILL UNKNOWN

                 HOLLY JONES 
       You sure you dont want some tea?

She sees Keller trembling as he slowly swivels the paper 
around, staring at it in disbelief.  

                 HOLLY JONES 
       Oh God, Im sorry, Mr. Dover, I 
       thought for sure you knew already.  
       I say its better this way.  That 
       awful man would of spent years on 
       death row -- watching tv and 
       getting fat...  But not knowing 
       where she rests is a horrible 
       thing.  I am so so sorry --

Keller gets up --


INT. OMALLEYS OFFICE - POLICE STATION - DAY


Loki sits in front of OMalleys desk, looking a mess, 
staring at a photocopy of the maze Bob drew while 
OMalley pours a glass of whiskey.

                 CAPTAIN RICHARD O'MALLEY
       Well at least I dont have to 
       worry about losing you to PSP.     

Loki isnt listening, moving a shaky finger over the maze 
drawing, lost, trying to find his way out.

                 CAPTAIN RICHARD O'MALLEY 
       When forensics is done with his 
       place were deploying cadaver 
       dogs.  
           (beat)
       Were not superheroes, kid.  We 
       dont save the fucking day.  Were 
       cops.  Hells janitors.  You want 
       fulfillment, start a family, have 
       some kids.  

INT. LOKIS DESK - CONYERS POLICE STATION - DAY


Loki walks to his desk, staring deliriously at the 
disarray.  He straight-arms everything to the floor, 
computer monitor and all.  No one walking by dares make 
mention of this.

His desk is now bare but for an evidence bag containing 
Jones' matchbox RV.  He sits down, takes the little RV 
out of the bag and sets it on his desk.  

He gives it the tiniest push, watching as it slowly rolls 
off the edge --

He reaches down to pick it up when something on the floor 
catches his eye...

The crime scene photos of the corpse he found in Father 
Dunns basement.  A close-up of the pendant the corpse 
was wearing with the maze carved into it.

Suddenly energized, he pulls the photocopy of Bob's map 
from his pocket, unfolds it and sets it on the desk next 
to the photo of the corpse's pendant...  

THEYRE IDENTICAL.  Lokis astounded.  His cell phone 
RINGS.

                 LOKI
           (into phone)
       Yeah?

                 FORENSICS GUY 
           (over the phone)
       We found something.


EXT. BOB TAYLORS BACKYARD - DAY

Loki walks up behind Forensics guy and the rest of his 
team, all of them staring down at...

What looks like two little bodies, half buried under 
garden pebbles and mulch.  But as Loki gets closer he 
sees its:

                 FORENSICS GUY
       Two kids size department store 
       mannequins with their heads caved 
       in.  And I just talked to my lab 
       guys.  Theyre telling me all of 
       the blood we sampled from the 
       plastic containers is pigs blood.
           (yelling to his team)
       Get those covered!  Its supposed 
       to snow soon.  Come on, hurry up!

INT. LIVING ROOM - BOB TAYLORS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS


A darkened mess of a room with mazes drawn on the walls 
and ceiling.  Forensics Guy and Loki enter --

                 FORENSICS GUY
       Its like hes playacting.  Case 
       in point, except for the few 
       pieces ID'd by the Dovers and the 
       Birches, all the other kids 
       clothes we found still had the 
       tags on them.  And the book of 
       mazes -- he made it out of 
       photocopies, pictures in this book 
       we found in the attic.  Ex-FBI 
       agent wrote it.

Forensics Guy grabs a beat-up hardcover off a table.

                 LOKI
           (reading the title)
       Finding the Invisible Man.

                 FORENSICS GUY
       Its about a theoretical suspect 
       he claimed was responsible for 
       numerous child abductions.  
       Totally discredited I guess, but I 
       read some of it, kind of 
       interesting.  

Forensics Guy flips through the book showing Loki some 
full page photographs of the real book of mazes.

                 LOKI
       Taylor was abducted when he was a 
       kid, escaped after three weeks.  
       His captor drugged him 
       continuously with an LSD, ketamine 
       cocktail.  He had no idea where 
       hed been.  They never caught the 
       guy.  

                 FORENSICS GUY
       There you go.  Probably read this 
       book and decided he was taken by 
       the Invisible Man.  Now hes doing 
       his best imitation.  

                 LOKI
       Did his best imitation.  He shot 
       himself last night.

Forensics Guy shakes his head.

                 FORENSICS GUY
       How did he do that?  I thought he 
       was in custody.

Loki ignores the question and takes a photocopy of Bobs 
map out of his pocket.

                 LOKI
       Taylor drew this.  It was supposed 
       to be a map to the bodies.  We 
       found a corpse last week wearing a 
       pendant with the same design on 
       it.

                 FORENSICS GUY
       Its not a map, its the last maze 
       in the maze book.  Unsolvable.  
       No way out.  Corpse is probably 
       just another wannabe who read the 
       book.  

                 LOKI
       So what are we saying?  Taylor is 
       a fake?  These girls could still 
       be alive somewhere?  How did he 
       get his hands on the clothes the 
       parents ID'd?

                 FORENSICS GUY
       That I can't reconcile.  

Loki pops a coffee bean in his mouth with a shaking hand, 
Forensics Guy watching on, concerned.


                 FORENSICS GUY 
       You alright?


Loki nods dismissively.  Forensics Guy nods back, doesn't 
push him -- has his own fish to fry. 

                 FORENSICS GUY 
           (yelling to his team)
       If there are windows open, get 
       them fucking shut.

Something occurs to Loki.  He pulls out his note pad, 
flipping through the pages, until he comes to: 
IN THE HOUSE?  OPEN WINDOW

INT. JOYS ROOM - THE BIRCHES' HOUSE - DAY

Joy's now dead gerbil lying in its habitrail.  Nancy 
stares down at it, something building inside her...

Eliza walks up behind her.

                 ELIZA
       What is it?


Nancy turns, losing control of herself and SMACKS Eliza 
across the face --

                 NANCY
       I told you to feed it!  Why didnt 
       you feed it?!      

Eliza stands there in shock.  She gives her mother a 
hating look, shakes her head in disbelief and rushes from 
the room --

EXT. THE BIRCHES HOUSE - CONTINUOUS


Eliza bursts out the front door, starts walking down the 
street towards the Dovers house.  Nancy appears in the 
doorway yelling after her --

                 NANCY
       Get back here!  I cant handle 
       this right now!

Eliza ignores her, keeps walking.  Nancy retreats back 
inside her house and SLAMS THE DOOR --

INT. RALPH'S ROOM - THE DOVERS' HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER


Ralph talks on the phone with Eliza as he looks out his 
window, watching as Loki walks through the bushes looking 
for something...

                 RALPH
           (into phone)
       OK, Ill pick you up --


EXT. THE DOVERS' HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Loki looks up at Annas window, maybe ten feet from the 
ground.  He looks down and notices two deep footprints 
filled with water -- someone dropped hard from the 
window.

He looks around thinking, checking the bushes...  His 
eyes go wide, as he picks something up.  A SOCK WITH A 
RABBIT FACE ON IT. 

As he deposits the sock in a little plastic bag he looks 
over to see Ralph coming out of the Dovers' house with a 
duffle bag slung over his shoulder.

                 LOKI
           (off Ralphs look)
       Just needed to check something.

Ralph nods curtly and throws the duffle bag in the back 
of Grace's compact.  He gets in the car and pulls out of 
the driveway --

Loki watches as Ralph drives down the street -- then 
stops -- Eliza running up to the car.  She gets inside 
and they drive off.


INT. BATHROOM - SECOND FLOOR APARTMENT - DAY

The pictures of Anna and Joy nailed to the cell.  
Angle widens to reveal:

KELLER IS FEEDING THE HEAD OF A BIG SNAKE INTO THE PVC 
PIPE, holding on to the tail as the rest disappears...

                 KELLER
       Feel him?


Nothing, and then Jones starts THRASHING inside the cell, 
SCREAMING.  Keller yanks the snake back out --

                 KELLER 
       Its going all the way in if you 
       dont start talking.

Keller BANGS on the cell --

  
                 KELLER 
     You hear me?  

No reply.  So Keller feeds the snake back in...until 
JONES LETS OUT A SCREECH and the cell starts shaking.  
Keller slowly pulls the snake back out --

 
                 KELLER 
      Last chance.

The snake dangles from Kellers hand, curling and 
uncurling, HISSING --  

                 KELLER 
       TALK!


Jones only whimpers.  So Keller feeds the snake all the 
way into the PVC pipe...and lets go -- 

Jones GOES BALLISTIC INSIDE, trying to CLAW HIS WAY OUT -- 

                 KELLER 
       Tell me about the God damn maze, 
       asshole!  Tell me and Ill get you 
       out right now.  Ill take you home 
       to your aunt.

Angle widens to reveal another dozen snakes in a 
cardboard box.  Keller grabs another one.  He starts 
feeding it into the tube when he hears JONES TRYING TO 
SAY SOMETHING and yanks it back out --

Keller presses his ear to the tube, but he still cant 
hear what Jones is saying.  He grabs a claw hammer off 
the floor...

And starts prying off a small panel of wood right where 
Jones head is, until...

Jones cadaver-like face is revealed, his mouth is 
moving, but Keller still cant hear him...

So he moves in closer, putting his head inside the cell, 
until his face is just inches away from Jones...  

                 JONES
       Theres no way out.  Its a 
       prison.  

Keller waits for more.  But it soon becomes apparent that 
there is no more.  Jones has gone blank.

Jones' POV as Keller replaces the panel of wood and 
EVERYTHING GOES BLACK: THE SOUND OF SNAKES HISSING, 
KELLER HAMMERING --

INT. A SMALL ROOM - DAY

CUT TO:

Joy opens her eyes, shes curled up on the floor, her 
lips stained purple...

For the rest of this sequence we stay with Joys POV: 

She sees Anna passed out on the floor a few feet away.  
The windows look like theyve been covered over with 
something -- all the furniture has been removed.  Theres 
a homemade book on the floor with a familiar cover: 
FINISH ALL THE MAZES AND YOU CAN GO HOME.

Joy starts to stand up -- HER VISION DISTORTING -- THE 
MORE SHE MOVES THE MORE DISTORTED HER VISION BECOMES.  
She struggles to steady herself -- her vision normalizes 
enough that she can discern the door is ajar... 

Theres a knocked over 2-liter bottle of what looks like 
grape-aid on the floor -- its purple contents have 
spilled out beneath the crack in the door, alerting their 
captor to the mess.  Theres a mop leaned against the 
wall; someone in the middle of cleaning up the grape-aid -
- whoever it is can be heard in the kitchen using the 
sink, theres a TV going somewhere -- 

Joy start shaking Anna -- gets her to wake up -- points 
to the door.  Anna is too out of it to move.  Joy pulls 
her up -- helps her --

Joy pulls Anna out the door -- everything starts spinning 
and distorting as they enter the hallway --  

Joy blindly feels the wall, moving through the morphing 
interior -- Anna starting to lag...

Then Joys hand finds a door knob, she looks up and sees 
sunlight blasting in through the window glass on the top 
of the door -- a way out.  Joy tries the knob -- its 
locked.  She fumbles with the little turn lock on the 
door knob -- unlocks the door --

EXT. A BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

Joys drugged POV -- as she move out the door, Anna right 
behind her -- the brightness of the outdoors is almost 
blinding -- the sound of someone stomping through the 
house after them -- THE KEEPER -- they start running 
across a morphing surface of snow and lawn as the Keeper 
gives chase...

Joy plows through some hedges into what looks like a 
field, Anna starting to lag --   

And then Joy looks beside her and Anna is gone, SCREAMING 
in the widening distance...

EXT. WOODS - DAY

Joy wanders through the woods, lost, exhausted, freezing.

EXT. BUSY STREET - DAY

Joys's POV: walking along the side of the road as cars 
fly by looking like astral comets, the sound of their 
engines like ROARING LIONS --

CUT TO: 

INT. COMPACT CAR - CONTINUOUS

A WOMAN, 43, drives, drinking coffee, soft rock on the 
radio.  She passes Joy on side of the road, running in 
the same direction.  No coat on.  Looks like she's in 
trouble.  

The Woman stops the car, rolling down her passenger side 
window as Joy runs past --

                 WOMAN 
       Hey, where's your Mommy?  Where 
       you going, hon?

The Woman gets out of her car and Joy bolts away from her 
across the street, RIGHT INTO THE PATH OF SPEEDING VAN --

The van slams on the brakes, SCREECHES OFF THE ROAD IN A 
CLOUD OF RUBBER SMOKE AND SLAMS INTO A TREE.  

The Woman runs to Joy and grabs hold of her, hugging her 
writhing form --

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - THE DOVERS' HOUSE - DAY


The phone is RINGING.  Its dark, the curtains are drawn.  
Grace emerges from the nest of blankets and picks up:

                 GRACE
           (groggy, into phone)
       Hello?

She listens, sitting there in the darkness...

INT. BATHROOM - THE DOVERS' HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Dirty clothes, wadded tissues and prescription bottles 
crowd the vanity.  The sound of Grace running from room 
to room -- 

                 GRACE 
       Keller!?  Ralph?!  

She comes bursting into the bathroom and turns on the 
cold water, splashing it on her face --

                 GRACE 
       Wake up, Grace.  Gotta wake up 
       now.

She accidentally knocks an open bottle of Xanax into the 
sink, half the pills spill out into the rushing water.  

She instinctively starts rescuing pills from the drain.  
But before long she decides to let them go.  She dumps 
out the rest -- hears Kellers truck pulling up out front 
--

EXT. THE DOVERS' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Keller is walking towards the house when Grace comes 
bursting out the front door in her nightgown -- puts her 
palsied hands on him --

                 GRACE
           (frantic)
       We need to go to the hospital.  
       They found Joy.  She's alive.  
       They didn't -- they didn't --

She starts sobbing -- Keller steadying her. 

 
                 KELLER
      What?  What?

She hugs him hard, talking into his shoulder:

                 GRACE
       Not Anna.  Joy was alone.  
       Anna wasn't with her --

Keller's POV, everything starts spinning, surreal, a news 
van heading for the Birches house whooshes by --

                 GRACE 
       We need to go see her.  Maybe she 
       knows where Anna is --

                 KELLER
       No, I'll go, you stay in case --


Grace isn't listening, she runs around and gets in the 
truck.


INT. HALLWAY - ST. CELESTINE HOSPITAL - DAY

A crowded hallway -- Detective Chemilinski, FRANKLINS 
OLDER BROTHER with HIS WIFE.  Keller pushes through, 
Grace behind him, wearing his coat over her nightgown.  A 
COP stops them -- 

                 COP
       Nobody gets beyond this point --

Grace rushes right past him --

                 COP 
       Miss! 

He grabs her shoulder.  She screams in his face:

                 GRACE
       Don't touch me!

Grace spots Franklin up the hall walking into a private 
room.  There!  She bolts down the hall, Keller right 
behind her --

                 COP
       Wait a minute!

INT. PRIVATE ROOM - ST. CELESTINE HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS


Franklin walks inside.  Nancy sits by the bedside hanging 
up her cell phone as TWO NURSES tend to Joy.

                 NANCY
       Elizas not picking up.

Before Franklin can answer Grace and Keller move inside -- 
the Cop right behind them --

                 COP
       You cant be in here.

The Cop grabs Keller, starts to escort him out.  

                 NANCY
       It's OK, It's OK --

The Cop looks at Keller and Grace, his demeanor softening 
as he recognizes who they are...

                 COP
       Just for a minute -- then you 
       gotta go.

The Cop exits.  Nancy lets Grace and Keller approach the 
bed.

                 NANCY
           (to Grace and Keller)
       Theyre gonna find Anna too,
       I know they are.  

Grace and Keller aren't listening, mesmerized by the 
sight of Joy lying there like some dream come to life.  

Keller squats down by the bed and looks Joy in the eyes.   

                 KELLER
       Was it far from our street?  Joy? 
       Did it take long to get there?

                 NURSE
       You cant be doing this now.  
       Shes been drugged.  The detective 
       will be back in a minute, you need 
       to wait --  

                 GRACE
           (to Joy)
       Just tell us she's alive.  Can you
       give us a nod -- just nod your 
       head.

Joy says nothing.  Grace tries to hold back tears, looks 
at Keller -- Franklin and Nancy staring at them -- when --

Joy slowly reaches out and touches Kellers hand -- 
looking like shed only now just recognized him -- 

Its dead silent as Joys eyes meet Kellers.  Everyone 
watching, waiting, and then she speaks:

                 JOY
       You were there.

Kellers eyes go wide...  

                 KELLER
       What?  I was where?

                 JOY
       It put tape on our mouths.  

Everyone looks at Keller.  He stares off, something 
building behind his eyes...

INT. HALLWAY - ST. CELESTINE HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

Loki walks down the hallway with the uniformed Cop -- 
Loki looks seriously pissed -- 

                 LOKI
       I said nobodys allowed in there 
       but her parents --

Up ahead Loki sees Keller walk out of the room.  Kellers 
eyes meet Lokis -- then --

Keller turns and heads in the opposite direction.  Grace 
comes out of the room -- 

                 GRACE
       Keller!    

                 LOKI
       Wheres he going?

Loki clocks Graces expression; she has no idea.  Loki 
looks back down the hallway -- the door to the stairwell 
swinging closed behind Keller.  Loki turns and yells down 
the hallway to the uniformed Cop --

                 LOKI 
       Call downstairs!  Dont let him 
       leave!

EXT. ST. CELESTINE HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER

Keller runs out of the entrance, booking it for his truck 
-- he hears voices starting to erupt behind him --

                 COP 
       Hey!  Stop!  

INT. KELLERS TRUCK - PARKED/TRAVELING - CONTINUOUS

Keller gets in his truck -- starts it up, throws it in 
gear and drives straight over a grassy median -- a 
shortcut to the main road --

EXT. ST. CELESTINE HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

Back to the entrance as Loki bursts out and runs to his 
car -- across the way he sees Kellers truck screeching 
off down the road --

Loki gets in his sedan -- while two other cops run to 
their cruisers -- 

INT. LOKIS SEDAN - MOMENTS LATER

Loki starts the engine, backs out fast -- reverses his 
car over the grassy median, the car shaking and bumping -- 
then spins out in the main road, oncoming traffic 
swerving past him -- horns blaring -- he floors it, 
picking up speed --

Loki speeds past car after car, then stops at an 
intersection, craning his head, looking every which way -- 

                 LOKI
       Come on -- where the hell did you 
       go?

Kellers truck is nowhere in sight.  

                 LOKI 
       Fuck.  FUCK!   

Loki thinks for a moment, blocking the 
intersection...when something occurs to him.  Suddenly 
electrified he does a screeching u-turn -- looks like he 
knows where hes going --

EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE - DAY

Graces car pulls up in front of the apartment house.  
Ralph gets out of the drivers seat, he opens the back 
door, grabs a duffle bag...

Eliza gets out of the passenger side.  Her cell phone 
rings, she checks it --

                 ELIZA
       My Mom again.  Maybe I should call 
       her back -- maybe something 
       happened?

                 RALPH
       Wait until we get inside. I don't 
       want anybody to see us --

She puts the phone away and follows Ralph to the rear of 
the building, trying to look inconspicuous. 

REAR OF APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

A low-lying boarded window as Ralph removes the board -- 

                 RALPH 
       My secret entrance.

The board slips from Ralphs fingers -- falls inside the 
apartment with a BANG --

INT. THE CELL - CONTINUOUS

The outside of the cell as the banging sound echoes from 
below.  The sound of Jones moving -- he hears them -- 


INT. FIRST FLOOR APARTMENT - APARTMENT HOUSE - MOMENTS 
LATER

Ralph and Eliza stand in the gutted first floor 
apartment.  They look around, the door to the hallway is 
open --  

A sound from above -- a thump.  They look up -- another 
thump.

                 ELIZA
       Someones here.  

She starts back for the open window when Ralph grabs her -
- 

                 RALPH
       My father kicks people out of here 
       all the time.  Its just a 
       homeless guy.  Wait here -- Ill 
       tell him to leave --

Ralph heads for the stairs --

                 ELIZA
       If youre doing this to impress 
       me, its not working.

                 RALPH
       Im doing it cause I dont want to 
       go back home.  Do you?  

She doesnt answer, but obviously dreads it as much he 
does -- 

INT. STAIRS - APARTMENT HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Ralph climbs the stairs.  He looks scared.

INT. SECOND FLOOR APARTMENT - APARTMENT HOUSE - MOMENTS 
LATER

The moment Ralph walks inside hes stricken by something.  
He toes a whiskey bottle with his sneaker...another THUMP 
--

Its coming from the open bathroom door...  

                 RALPH
       Hey.  Youre trespassing.  Get out 
       of here or Im gonna call the 
       cops.

Ralph steps closer to the open door -- confused -- 
doesnt look like theres anyone inside.  But then he 
sees the cell...THE PICTURE OF ANNA AND JOY nailed to the 
outside, staring at him.

INT. FIRST FLOOR APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS


Eliza, waiting nervously when Ralph yells down to her --

                 RALPH 
       ELIZA!  Eliza, get up here!   

INT. BATHROOM - SECOND FLOOR APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Ralph, holding the cell phone to his ear with a shaking 
hand.

                 911 OPERATOR 
           (over the phone)
       911 emergency.  What is your 
       location?

Eliza enters behind him -- sees the pictures, goes white -
- 

                 ELIZA
       What is this --

                 RALPH
           (into the phone)
       Two thirty four Campello Street.  
       My sister -- 

THUMP -- from inside the cell.  

                 ELIZA
       Oh my God. 

Ralph closes his eyes, his breath getting away from him --

                 RALPH
           (into the phone)
       I think I found my sister -- Anna 
       Dover --

                 911 OPERATOR 
           (over the phone)
       Just stay calm well have someone 
       out there in a couple minutes.  
       I want you to stay on the line 
       with me --

THUMP -- Ralph drops the phone.  He starts moving his 
palsied hands over the wood, searching for a way to break 
inside.  

                 RALPH
       Help me.  Come on.

She shakes her head.

                 ELIZA
       I cant.  I cant.

                 RALPH
       Yeah you can, come on.

She nods, tears streaming down her horrified face.  Ralph 
speaks into the tube.

                 RALPH 
       Its OK, were getting you out -- 
       were getting you both out of 
       there.  Can you hear me?

Eliza joins Ralph, trying to pull at the seams of the 
wood --

Together they pull at a panel of wood.  It starts 
breaking away as nails clink on the floor...  

Eliza and Ralph stand back, horrified...

EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Lokis sedan screeches to a halt -- he gets out -- hears 
ELIZA SCREAMING INSIDE.  He starts for the front door 
when he sees the padlock and changes course --

Loki runs around to the back of the building -- heading 
for the window he used to get inside earlier --

INT. STAIRS - THE APARTMENT HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER


Lokis POV as he runs up the stairs -- sees Ralph and 
Eliza coming down the stairs towards him --

                 LOKI
       What is it? 

He sees the shock in their faces, they cant speak -- he 
rushes past them --


INT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - APARTMENT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS


Lokis POV as he gets to the top of the stairs, gun at 
the ready -- moving down the hallway towards the open 
door of the apartment...

He arrives at the open door, looks inside.  His face 
drops...he lowers his gun...

CUT TO:

EXT. FRONT DOOR - HOLLY JONES' HOUSE - NIGHT


Keller rings the doorbell.  Angle widens -- hes standing 
at the door, holding a duffle bag...

  
                 HOLLY JONES 
     Just a minute.

Holly Jones opens the door looking a little out of 
breath.  Shes now holding a big ice pack around her 
hand.

                 HOLLY JONES 
       Hello again.

                 KELLER
       Hello.  I was -- I was hoping 
       youd let me do some penance.

She looks a little baffled.

                 HOLLY JONES
       For what?

                 KELLER
       For scaring you that day at the 
       police station.  

She nods, regaining her poker face.

                 HOLLY JONES
       Youve already apologized for 
       that.

                 KELLER
       I know, but I thought you might 
       need something fixed up around the 
       house?  Brought my tools.  

She eyes his bag.

                 HOLLY JONES
       Oh.  I see.  
           (motioning to her ice 
            pack)
       I burned myself.  Feeling a little 
       icky today.  
           (beat)
       But Im glad you want to talk some 
       more.  Theres no need to make 
       excuses.  Come in, you can make me 
       some tea.


INT. VESTIBULE - HOLLY JONES HOUSE - NIGHT

Jones Aunt shows Keller inside and closes the door, 
turning her back to him as she walks to the kitchen.  
Keller lingers in the vestibule, watching her, 
considering...

                 HOLLY JONES
       What are you waiting for, Mr. 
       Dover?  

He stops, looking caught.

 
                 KELLER
      What?

                 HOLLY JONES
       Come on in and make me some tea.

INT. KITCHEN - HOLLY JONES' HOUSE - NIGHT

Keller turns on the faucet, fills the tea kettle with 
water.  

He turns on the gas fueled stove burner.  He stares down 
into the little blue flame --

                 KELLER
       I dont want to have to hurt you.  
       I know they were here --

He turns around to see the ice pack fall from her hand, 
revealing a .38 revolver.  She stands up, gun leveled at 
Kellers head.  

                 HOLLY JONES
       Put your hands on your head and 
       turn around.

Keller doesnt move.

                 KELLER
       Im just gonna go.

                 HOLLY JONES
       You dont know me, Mr. Dover.  
       Believe me when I tell you I wont 
       let you go.

Keller considers, watching her.  Her eyes dont waver.  
Her hands dont shake...  

He puts his hands on his head and turns around.  She 
moves in and lifts the back of his coat.  Theres a 
pistol tucked into the back of his waistband.  She grabs 
it out and tosses it into a nearby wastebasket.

                 HOLLY JONES 
       Good.  Now, right in front of you.  
       The top drawer.  Open it.

Keller takes a breath, and opens the drawer...

Inside is a rusted old pair of handcuffs.  

       Put them on.

Keller doesnt move.

                 HOLLY JONES 

                 HOLLY JONES 
       Put them on.


Keller takes his time picking up the handcuffs, observes 
their corroded condition.  

He clamps them on his wrists.  Keeping the gun on him she 
opens the refrigerator and takes out a 2 liter bottle 
filled with the laced grape-aid.

                 HOLLY JONES 
       You dont have to drink the whole 
       thing.  About a third should be 
       fine for a man your size.  
       Something to keep you manageable. 


                 HOLLY JONES 
       Even in handcuffs I have a feeling 
       youre going to be a problem.


                 KELLER
       Forget it.


                 HOLLY JONES
       Drink it, Mr. Dover, or Ill kill 
       you right here in my kitchen, and 
       then Ill bring your daughter in 
       and make her scrub your brains off 
       the floor. 

He lunges towards her --

 
                 KELLER
      WHERE IS SHE?!

She cocks the .38.  He stops, trembling, ready to throw 
up, looking for something to grab, something to duck 
behind -- but theres nothing.  He breathes out, manic...

And grabs the bottle.  And drinks, hating eyes on her all 
the while.  A third of it gone, he sets it back on the 
table, grimacing, wiping his purple lips.

                 HOLLY JONES
       Good, isnt it.  Its my husbands 
       recipe.  Now were going out the 
       back --

A RING TONE stops them both.  Keller looks down at his 
coat pocket as his cell phone continues to RING -- 

                 HOLLY JONES 
       Take it out of your pocket.  Do 
       not answer it.

With a little trouble due to his shackled hands, Keller 
pulls out his ringing cell phone.  The caller ID 
displays: GRACE

                 HOLLY JONES 
       Put it in the sink.

Keller does as hes told, then:  

                 HOLLY JONES 
       And your car keys -- on the table.

Keller pulls his keys from his pocket, drops them on the 
table.

Holly motions for him to move aside.  She pockets his  
keys, then goes to the sink and pushes the phone down the 
garbage disposal.  Its still RINGING when --

She turns on the disposal -- THE SOUND OF METAL GRINDING -
-

EXT. BACK YARD - HOLLY JONES HOUSE - NIGHT

Keller, hands cuffed in front of him, exits the house 
through the back door with Holly Jones following, pistol 
in hand.  

                 HOLLY JONES
       Walk to the car.

She directs him to the old Trans Am parked on the grass.  

                 HOLLY JONES 
       The look on your face when I 
       opened the door -- my husband had 
       that very same look the day we 
       took Alex.  
           (beat)
       He was the first kid we ever took.  
       His real name was Jimmy or Barry -- 
       I cant remember.  I doubt he can 
       either.  So many names.  I forgot 
       all about Bobby until I read about 
       him in the paper.  He never forgot 
       us though -- neither will your 
       neighbors bitch daughter.  They 
       never really get away, their minds 
       I mean.  Making children disappear 
       is how we wage war with God.  
       Makes people lose their faith.  
       Breeds demons like you.  Ive had 
       to slow down since my husband 
       disappeared, but I do what I can.  

Keller continues on, woozy.  They arrive at the Trans Am.  
She opens the drivers side door.

 
                 HOLLY JONES 
      Get in.

Keller gets behind the wheel.  The keys are in the 
ignition.  The key chain is an upside down cross.  
Standing inside the open car door, Holly Jones puts the 
gun to Kellers head.

 
                 HOLLY JONES 
      Start the car.

Keller turns the key.  The engine COUGHS --

                 HOLLY JONES 
       Keep trying.  



He keeps trying, while staring through the dirty 
windshield, maybe planning an escape route...

                 HOLLY JONES 
       You should know Alex didnt lay a 
       hand on the girls, just wanted to 
       give them a ride in the RV.  I was 
       the one who decided they should 
       stay.  

Guilt creasing his forehead, Keller starts to look a 
little sick.  THE ENGINE FINALLY TURNS OVER -- ITS LOUD.

                 HOLLY JONES 
           (yelling over the 
            engine)
       Put it in reverse.  Back up.  
       Slowly.

Keller shifts into reverse and the car starts to inch 
backwards.  Holly Jones walks close beside it, keeping 
the gun pressed to Kellers head.


                 HOLLY JONES 
       Stop.
    Turn it off.

Keller stops the car, staring straight ahead.   

   
                 HOLLY JONES 
 Turn it off.

He hesitates for a moment, perhaps weighing his options.  
She starts to push the gun barrel into his ear.

      
He cuts the engine.

                 HOLLY JONES 
       Out.  

                 HOLLY JONES 

Keller steps out of the car, teetering, starting to lose 
his equilibrium.  He sees the car was covering a big door-
size piece of plywood lying flat on the ground.

                 HOLLY JONES 
       Go ahead, take a look.  Maybe your 
       daughter is underneath.  You never 
       know.

Frantic, Keller drags the plywood aside.  But when he 
sees whats beneath it, the verve just drains from his 
body...

Its a grave-like hole in the ground, maybe twelve feet 
deep.  

                 HOLLY JONES 
       I hid the girls here before the 
       police came to search the house.  
       Should have left them down there, 
       but I wanted them to last for at 
       least a few weeks.  So lonely 
       without Alex.
           (beat)
       Now get in.  

                 KELLER
       You want me to get in there, 
       youre gonna have to shoot me.  
       Im not doing it just cause you 
       asked --

BANG.  She fires a shot into Kellers thigh.  He stumbles 
-- the soil crumbles out from under him and he falls...


INT. THE HOLE - CONTINUOUS

Keller lands hard, blood bubbling from the gunshot wound 
in his thigh. 

Kellers POV, staring straight up: Holly Jones staring 
down.

                 HOLLY JONES
       Make yourself a tourniquet.  If 
       you can manage to stem the 
       bleeding you might last as long as 
       twenty-four hours.  I'd love for 
       you to still be alive when I dump 
       your daughter's body down there. 

She starts dragging the board back over the hole... 

Keller tries to get up, gritting his teeth, and then he 
sees it: ANNAS RED WHISTLE lying a few feet away from 
him.  
But as he reaches for it --

EVERYTHING GOES BLACK...  

THE SOUND OF THE TRANS AM STARTING UP AND ROLLING OVER 
THE COVERED HOLE...

EXT. BACK YARD - HOLLY JONES HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Holly Jones cuts the engine and gets out of the car.  As 
she walks back to the house IT STARTS TO SNOW...

EXT. GUN HILL ROAD - MOMENTS LATER 


Holly gets in Kellers truck and starts it up.  She 
drives it into the backyard, out of sight...

INT. PRIVATE ROOM - ST. CELESTINE HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Joy lies sleeping in her hospital bed, Nancy and Franklin 
on either side of her, watching the TV: shaky news 
footage of the apartment house, as Jones is loaded into 
the ambulance...

A REPORTER stares into the camera, the commotion to his 
back.

                 REPORTER
       While police havent released any 
       official statements yet, several 
       sources maintain that Jones has 
       been held captive for the last 
       five days in the apartment 
       building right behind me here.  

Nancy and Franklin look at each other in silence...

INT. DEN - HOLLY JONES HOUSE - NIGHT

Holly Jones stands in the entranceway watching the same 
news report on her TV.  

                 REPORTER 
       Weve also just learned that the 
       building might be owned, in some 
       capacity by Anna Dovers father...

She exudes a rage that seems ten sizes too big for her 
body...  

EXT. HOLLY JONES' HOUSE - NIGHT


The lights in the windows go out one by one -- 


INT. KITCHEN - HOLLY JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Holly Jones hoists Kellers duffle bag up off the floor 
and sets it on the kitchen table.  

She unzips it and starts emptying the contents on to the 
table: rope, the rifle, duct tape, the white bag Nancy 
gave Keller.  She looks inside the bag...

THE WHITE BOX WITH THE SKULL AND CROSSBONES, A SYRINGE...

INT. BATHROOM - SECOND FLOOR APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS


Loki and Forensiscs Guy stare at the empty cell, 
completely befuddled, as are the rest of the cops and 
forensics techs moving in and out.

INT. SECOND FLOOR APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Loki walks out of the bathroom.  OMalley is there, 
finishing giving orders to a UNIFORMED COP.

                 CAPTAIN RICHARD O'MALLEY
       ...with a camera get within twenty 
       feet of that room, youre fired.  
           (to Loki)
       Come here.

He ushers Loki out of the rest of the cops earshot.  
Loki looks completely deflated, lost.  

                 LOKI
       Im gonna find Dover --

                 CAPTAIN RICHARD O'MALLEY
       No youre not.  Holly Jones needs 
       to be notified.  Go, now.

INT. THE HOLE - CONTINUOUS

DARKNESS -- as Keller flicks a lighter, the quivering 
flame illuminating his face.  He looks up...climbing out 
might not be an option.

He looks down at his hands.  The rusted chain connecting 
the handcuffs broke in the fall.     

He moves the flame around illuminating two rusted 
childrens bicycles, several empty plastic 2 liter 
bottles...an old dirt encrusted childs sneaker...

He reels, loses his breath, lets the flame go out.

He reaches up, digs his hands in the wall and starts 
trying to climb out...

After a few feet the dirt crumbles like dry cake and he 
slides back down.

He flicks the lighter again, looks up at the dirt 
wall...spies a loop of tree root protruding out.  He 
tries to grab it, but its just out of reach...

He grabs the childrens bicycles, stacks them against the 
dirt wall -- hes able to step up on them, gives him a 
little more height, he reaches up... 

Grabs hold of the loop of tree root -- he PULLS HIMSELF 
UP -- reaching his other hand up, grabbing at the lip of 
the hole --

INT. BLACK SEDAN - TRAVELING - NIGHT

Loki pulls up in front of Holly Jones house.  He turns 
off the engine --

INT. A ROOM - HOLLY JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

ANNA lies on the floor, asleep.  THE SOUND OF THE 
DEADBOLT LOCK TUMBLING.  She starts to wake up...  

The door starts to open -- when the DOORBELL RINGS -- 

EXT. FRONT DOOR - HOLLY JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Loki RINGS the door bell again and waits...


EXT. UNDER THE TRANS AM - CONTINUOUS

Kellers fingers peeking out from under the sheet of 
plywood as he manages to push it off center, giving him 
enough space to climb out...

Keller grabs hold of one of the Trans Ams underside 
pipes -- the pipe BREAKS -- OIL SPRAYS IN KELLERS FACE 
as he grabs hold of another pipe, and pulls himself up 
and out...

Keller crawls out from under the Trans Am.  He leans 
against the car, blackened with dirt and motor oil, 
sucking air...

EXT. FRONT DOOR - HOLLY JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Loki starts back down the walkway -- as hes walking he 
glances back over his shoulder -- gives the house a last 
look and notices something...

A curtain swaying ever so slightly -- like someone was 
just peeking out at him.  

Loki stops, turns around and walks back to the front 
door.  He stands there, listening...hears what sounds 
like someone moving around inside --

                 LOKI
       Miss Jones?  You in there?  

Then Loki hears something else -- its faint and brief -- 
sounds like someone crying out --

INT. VESTIBULE - HOLLY JONES HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Loki opens the front door and moves inside, keyed up --

INT. BACK DOOR - HOLLY JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

The back door opens.  Keller creeps inside, his oil 
slicked form almost invisible in the gloom...

INT. LIVING ROOM - HOLLY JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Loki moves inside.  Nobody there.  He goes to leave when 
his eye catches a framed photo, basked in moonlight:

Holly Jones husband wearing an unsettling smile, 
shirtless, revealing hes wearing THE FAMILIAR MAZE 
PENDANT.  HES THE CORPSE LOKI FOUND IN DUNNS BASEMENT.  

SOMETHINGS KNOCKED OVER IN THE ADJACENT KITCHEN.  Loki 
snaps back to attention, eyes darting, moving now...

INT. KITCHEN - HOLLY JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Lokis POV as he enters the kitchen: Kellers duffle bag 
on the kitchen table.  The open box with the skull and 
crossbones: 

POISON!  Fast acting, humane...

INT. HALLWAY - HOLLY JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS


Keller, moves into the hallway, holding his breath, back 
to the wall.  He opens a door and looks in at...

A room stuffed with old furniture and junk...  

He moves on to the next.  The closed door with the 
deadbolt on the outside...  

He turns the lock, bracing himself...

INT. A ROOM - HOLLY JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Keller opens the door to see Anna huddled in the corner.  
He walks towards her, eyes tearing, breath quickening...

INT. HALLWAY - HOLLY JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Loki approaches the same room, then stops, seeing a 
shadow on the wall, a figure, looming over Annas 
shadow...

Loki takes a breath, gun at the ready, inching towards 
the doorway...

INT. A ROOM - HOLLY JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Keller, Anna in his arms now, rushing for the door -- 
when IT SLAMS IN HIS FACE and theyre thrown into 
DARKNESS --

INT. THE HOLE - CONTINUOUS

BACK TO:

BLACKNESS...the click of Kellers mini-maglight, shining 
up under his chin.  His face, sea-sick, blinking, rubbing 
his eyes, seeing: Dirt walls, the two rusted bikes, ALL OF IT DISTORTING.  The laced grape-aid.  His escape was a hallucination.  
HES STILL IN THE HOLE.

EXT. BACK YARD - HOLLY JONES HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

The Trans Am.  We hear Keller screaming beneath it ever 
so faintly...

INT. A ROOM - HOLLY JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Loki walks into the doorway, gun outstretched, eyes 
focusing:

The shadow isnt Keller -- its Holly Jones, now 
squatting beside Anna, her back to Loki, starting to 
inject the poison into her arm. 

                 LOKI
       STOP -- PUT IT DOWN --

She pulls out the half-emptied syringe and drops it to 
the floor.  Then her back still to him, she straightens 
up.

                 HOLLY JONES
       Make sure they cremate me.  I 
       dont want to be buried in some 
       box.

                 LOKI
       TURN AROUND -- SHOW ME YOUR HANDS -
       -

Holly Jones pulls the .38 from the front of her pants, 
swings around and FIRES at the same time Loki does --

SHE GRAZES LOKIS FACE RIGHT OVER HIS EYE.  Loki HITS HER 
SQUARE IN THE FOREHEAD.  She collapses, dead.  

Blood pouring from his forehead, Loki picks up Anna, now 
semi-unconscious -- gritting his teeth --

EXT. HOLLY JONES HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Loki bursts out the front door with Anna in his arms, 
blood running down his face --

He gets her in the back of his car.  He rushes around, 
gets behind the wheel -- starts the car and GUNS IT --

       Stay with me, Anna, were almost 
       there --
           (under his breath)
       Dont die.  Please, God, dont let 
       her die --

He sees the traffic is stopped up ahead -- he turns off, 
cuts through a strip mall parking lot --

Lokis POV as he drives faster -- the lights and falling 
snow become disorienting -- prismatic -- 

EXT. STRIP MALL - CONTINUOUS

Lokis sedan blasts out of the strip mall parking lot, 
makes a hard, skidding turn --

INT. BLACK SEDAN - TRAVELING - CONTINUOUS

Lokis POV -- on a straightaway now...the illuminated 
hospital sign coming into view --

EXT. ST. CELESTINE HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ENTRANCE - 
MOMENTS LATER

Lokis car rolls up on the curb, the front bumper inches 
from taking out a shocked OLD MAN in a wheel chair.  Loki 
bursts out of the car, opens the back door, grabs Anna 
out --

He carries her, blood gushing down his face, walking 
through the double doors -- SCREAMING:

                 LOKI
       POLICE OFFICER -- I NEED HELP!

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - ST. CELESTINE HOSPITAL - DAY

A patient lies in his hospital bed, his face obscured by 
the newspaper hes reading: 

BARRY MILLAND AKA ALEX JONES
REUNITED WITH FAMILY AFTER 27 YEARS

A picture of Jones in the hospital, his beard shaved off, 
revealing a previously hidden resemblance to the photos 
of him at seven years old.

Below that is another headline: STILL MISSING
A picture of Keller.

The patient folds up the paper.  Its Loki, oxygen tubes 
in his nostrils, bandages over his wound.  Someone 
approaches his bedside...

Its Grace pushing Anna in a wheelchair.  Anna is dressed 
in hospital pajamas, remnants of shock still clouding her 
eyes.

                 LOKI
       Hello.


She doesnt answer.  

                 GRACE
       Shes doing real good -- be on her 
       feet in a few days. 

Behind them are Nancy and Joy.  Grace seems possessed of 
some newfound strength, while Nancy seems withered and 
shaky.

                 GRACE 
       I hope were not intruding.  
       Anna wanted to see her hero.  

Anna stares at Loki, unable to speak.  He offers her his 
hand, noticing she's wearing a red whistle around her 
neck.  She shakes his hand, regarding him like an 
apparition.  

And while she does Loki looks over at Nancy, picking up 
on the guilt thats underlying her expression.  She 
senses him reading her and looks away --  

Lokis gaze moves on to Joy.  Theres an unsettling 
darkness in her eyes.

 
                 GRACE 
      OK --


                 GRACE 
           (to Nancy)
       Will you give me a minute?

Nancy nods, pushes Anna towards the exit -- Joy following 
them out --

                 NANCY
       Say goodbye girls.

With whisper voices:

        ANNA
	Bye.


Nancy leaves with the girls...

	JOY
	Bye.


INT. HALLWAY - ST. CELESTINE HOSPITAL

Nancy walks out with the girls.  Eliza is there, Ralph by 
her side.  Franklin is there too.  Nancy looks at him, 
imploring him with a silent plea -- a plea Franklin looks 
to be struggling against...

Franklin suddenly breaks Nancys gaze -- walks to a 
UNIFORM COP posted at the end of the hall...

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - ST. CELESTINE HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS


Grace stands by Lokis bedside.

                 LOKI
       She found her whistle.

                 GRACE
       No.  She keeps insisting Joy 
       helped her find it on Thanksgiving 
       before they were taken, but I 
       think shes just confused...  I 
       got her a new one.  
           (beat)
       He hasnt contacted me.  I know 
       you dont believe me, but he 
       hasnt.

                 LOKI
       I believe you.


                 GRACE
       Do you think youre going to find 
       him?
 
                 LOKI
      Yes.  

                 GRACE
       Theyll send him to jail?  

Beat.

                 LOKI
       Probably.

                 GRACE
       I miss him.


Loki nods, not sure what to say to that.

                 GRACE
       He did what he had to do for Anna.  
       And I thank God that he did.

Loki doesnt answer, the two of them sharing the silence, 
until:

                 GRACE 
       Hes a good man.

And with that she abruptly walks out...

Loki picks the newspaper back up.  He looks at the 
picture of Keller...  

EXT. BACK YARD - HOLLY JONES HOUSE - NIGHT

Its the middle of the night.  The sound of GENERATORS 
HUMMING, powering industrial spot lights, illuminating 
the back yard as snow falls.  

The Trans Am has not been moved.  The seats have been 
ripped out, lying next to the car.  

Closer to the house, two tired looking FORENSIC TECHS, 
late twenties, kneel on the ground scraping at the frozen 
soil -- they have a radio on, working to classical music -
-

The back door opens and out walks Loki, head bandaged.  
He looks broken, left the hospital too early.

He surveys the backyard.  

                 LOKI
       Find anything?

Tech 1 holds up a plastic bag.  Inside is a frozen, 
partially decomposed snake.

                 TECH 1
       Just this so far.  Grounds frozen 
       solid.  Its gonna take us weeks 
       to excavate the whole property.

Loki surveys the yard for a moment with a weary 
expression.  

                 LOKI
       Pray for the best.  Prepare for 
       the worst.  

Finished for the night, Tech 1 shuts off the spotlights, 
and with a loud CLICK CLACK the back yard goes dark.  

Tech 2 shuts off the radio and follows his cohort into 
the house.  Loki hangs back.  Its dead quiet now.  

Loki walks around the yard.  He takes a closer look at 
the Trans Am, staring into its gutted interior, 
thinking...

He walks back towards the house, looking bothered by 
something, his mind grinding gears...  

He takes a last look at the moonlit yard, then turns 
around about to enter the house -- when he hears 
something...

Its very faint, but almost sounds like a whistle.  
Loki turns around.  Could have been the wind, but...  

There it is again.  Its coming from the Trans Am.  

Loki walks through the snow to the Trans Am, dread 
blossoming in his eyes.  He hears the whistle again and 
picks up the pace, almost there as we --

FADE TO BLACK.

THE END
