FADE IN:

EXT. CAR, HIGHWAY - NIGHT

A downpour.  Windshield wipers thwack against the rain.

INT. CAR

KYLE LAFFERTY (20’s) drives, angrily wipes condensation from 
the glass.  

KIMBERLY BROOKS (20’s) sits shotgun.  Sulks. 

Kyle and Kimberly.  High School Sweethearts.  

             KYLE
    Me, smiling like a fool.  “It’s fine, 
    hon, we’ll talk in the car.”  This is 
    not fine.  I’m not fine.

LIGHTNING rips at the night.  A DISCO BALL ORNAMENT hangs from 
the rearview, scatters the light.

             KIMBERLY
    I just need more time.  So do you.  
    You just won’t--
           (looks at road)
    Kyle.  Slow down.

A TRACTOR TRAILER rumbles past.  

SPLASH.  The windshield’s doused.  Wipers flail.

             KYLE
    Everyone was there tonight.  We 
    should’ve told them.  “Thanks for 
    coming.  Oh and Kim needs more time.”

Ahead, a CAR slams its brakes.  Kyle swerves.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    Damn it.


He scrubs off some speed.  Twists the defrost to HIGH.  Wipes 
again at the foggy glass.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    Sorry.  I was out of line.

Kyle reaches over, puts a hand on hers.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    You’re scared.  I get it.

                                      2.

She pulls her hand away.

             KIMBERLY
    No.  No, you don’t.

He takes his eyes off the road, turns to her.

             KYLE
    What are you saying?

             KIMBERLY
    I love you, Kyle.  I do, but--

Oncoming HEADLIGHTS illuminate Kimberly’s face.

The disco ball catches the light - throws it around the car.

BLINDING LIGHT.

INT. HOSPITAL - LATER

Trauma Unit.  STAFF scramble, prep for--

Doors burst open.  Paramedics pull in GURNEYS.  

DR. TORY BENEFIELD (50’s) meets them.  She’s commanding, calm.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    What do we have?

             PARAMEDIC
    Severe head trauma, depressed cranial 
    fracture.  Glad you’re here tonight, 
    Doc.

The gurneys are lined up.  Nurses hang bags, cut clothing.

Benefield moves to Kyle’s stretcher.  He struggles to breathe.

             PARAMEDIC
	(CONT’D)
    Name’s Kyle.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Kyle.  You’re going to be fine.  

             PARAMEDIC
    BP’s seventy over forty-five.  Status 
    post four liters normal saline.

Not good.  Benefield stays cool.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Nora-epi, four mgs stat.

                                      3.

An angry red SEATBELT BURN cuts across Kyle’s chest.  
Benefield feels for other injuries.  Quick.  Efficient.

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(CONT’D)
    Kyle?  Can you hear me?

But Kyle’s not looking at her.  His eyes are focused on the 
gurney to his right.  Kimberly.  Unconscious, bloody.  

Doctors work frantically on her body, block Kyle’s view.

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(O.S.)
	(CONT’D)
    You stay with me, Kyle. 

His eyes slide shut.

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(O.S.)
	(CONT’D)
    O.R. three.


Kyle forces his eyes open, tries to hold them on Kimberly as 
he’s wheeled away...

The FLASH of overhead fluorescents.

FLASH.

At one care station, there’s a DOCTOR with a crying CHILD...

More lights overhead.  FLASH.  FLASH.

An ELDERLY WOMAN getting oxygen...

FLASH.  FLASH.

A NURSE bandaging a YOUNG WOMAN’s forehead...

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(O.S.)
	(CONT’D)
    Let's move it.

FLASH FLASH FLASHFLASHFLASH...

INT. BEDROOM - DAY

Plain room.  Shadows blacken corners, only the BED sees light.

Kyle’s on his back.  Stares a hole through the ceiling.

The sun comes up, goes down, comes up. 

He blinks.  Once.

Another revolution of the sun.  Light... dark... light.

All while he lies, motionless.  Staring.

                                      4.

EXT. CEMETERY - TWO DAYS LATER

More rain.  Wind, thunder.

Kyle leans on a CRUTCH, against a black Cadillac.  The rain 
seems to target him.  He’s oblivious.

An UMBRELLA moves in, blocks the water. 

LYDIA LAFFERTY (50’s), holds the umbrella over her son’s head.

MOURNERS step up, offer condolences.

             LYDIA
    Where’s Sam?

Kyle nods toward the car.  AN ELDERLY MAN comes up to him.  

             ELDERLY MAN
    It was a beautiful service...

The sound trails off.  The man’s lips form unheard words.  

Kyle looks around.  Rain slaps the car... trees sway in the 
wind... people shuffle over wet pavement, talking... 

But there’s no sound.

Then the silence is broken by his mother’s voice:

             LYDIA
    Ready, honey?

Sounds come flooding back to Kyle.  What the--

             LYDIA
	(CONT’D)
    Is it your head?  Do we need to take 
    you back?  The doctors said--

             KYLE
    That I might be fuzzy for a while.  
    That’s all it was.  Let’s go. 

She opens the car door, he slides into the back seat.

INT. CADILLAC

SAM ANDERSON (20’s), rough-cut hammer-head with a Mack Truck 
build, is slumped in the seat.  

He sits up, pretends he wasn’t crying.  Kyle lets him play it 
off, pulls the door shut.

                                      5.

LAUNDRY ROOM - LATER THAT DAY

Kyle pulls a load of LAUNDRY - whites - from the dryer.  
They’re all tinted PINK.  

He digs through the clothes.  There: a pair of RED PANTIES.

FLASHBACK - BEDROOM

Wearing nothing but the panties, Kimberly wiggles her ass at 
him, grins over her shoulder.

She turns, shakes RED CHEERLEADING POM-POMS that she’s holding 
in front of her breasts.

END FLASHBACK

Kyle rubs his eyes.  Damn.

BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT

             KIMBERLY
	(V.O.)
           (urgent)
    Kyle.  Wake up.

Kyle wakes in a sweat.  Reaches for the lamp.

A SHADOW crosses in front of the door.  

He freezes.  Then shoots from the bed, races to the hallway.

             KYLE
    Kimberly.  Kim.

He looks around, hopeful.  

But no.  He’s alone.

LIVING ROOM - DAYS LATER

Rain lashes the windows.

Kyle’s on the sofa.  He stares at the TV.  It’s OFF.

Lydia’s at the door.

             LYDIA
    Leftovers are in the fridge.  I’ll 
    see you tomorrow?

Kyle doesn’t respond.  She opens the door, and her umbrella. 

                                      6.

             KYLE
    Mom.  Be careful...
           (beat)
    In the rain.

There's no reply.  Kyle turns to his mom... but she's gone, 
and the door's closed.

INT. KITCHEN - MONTHS LATER

Kyle comes in through the back door.  His hair’s a shaggy 
mess.  He's really let himself go. 

He drops groceries onto the table.  

Then: he hears hushed VOICES.  A conversation.  Words unclear. 

Someone’s here. 

             KYLE
    Mom?


He heads into...

DINING ROOM

Stops.  Listens.  Voices still muffled.

He moves more slowly, into...

LIVING ROOM

Can’t get a bead on the voices.  Where are they coming from?

Then, suddenly, loud and clear:

             SAM
	(V.O.)
    Hey.  It’s Sam.

There, right next to him: the ANSWERING MACHINE.

             SAM
	(V.O.)
    I don’t even know if you’re going to 
    hear this, but I gotta tell you, I 
    just saw your mom.  She’s real 
    worried about you.  We all are.  You 
    have to hang in there.  
           (beat)
    Just try.  Okay?

Kyle stares at the machine.

                                      7.

INT. BAR - A FEW NIGHTS LATER

Sam sucks the bottom from a MILLER LIGHT... belches.

             KYLE
    Forgot how classy you are.

             SAM
    That’s what happens when you ignore 
    your friends for three months.
           (studies Kyle)
    You look like shit.
           (beat)
    We all lost her.  We all miss her.

Kyle rubs his temples.  A FLASH behind his lids:

             SAM
	(V.O.)
           (muffled)
    I should have said something.

             KYLE
    What?


             SAM
    Sunday.  The guys.  A game.  You in?

Kyle hesitates.  That’s not what he heard.

             SAM
	(CONT’D)
    Hey, no worries if it’s too soon. 

Nothing from Kyle.

             SAM
	(CONT’D)
    Forget I mentioned it.  

             KYLE
    She was dumping me.  For good this 
    time.  Soon as we left the party, she 
    laid it on me.  Didn’t want to marry 
    me.  Said she loved me.  But.

             SAM
    But what?


Kyle’s silent.  Sam seems desperate to know.

             SAM
	(CONT’D)
    She loved you, but what?

             KYLE
    That’s it.  Last thing she said.  I 
    love you.  But.

                                      8.

INT. KYLE’S BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING

Kyle wears a PRESSED SHIRT, tucks the hem into his pants.  
Hair's still too long, but he’s cleaner, shaved.  

He picks up a bouquet of PINK TULIPS.  Steels himself.

EXT. CEMETERY - THAT AFTERNOON

Kyle stares at an enormous bouquet of STARGAZER LILIES on a 
grave.  On the gravestone: KIMBERLY BROOKS 

He sets down his tulips next to the Stargazers.

             WOMAN
	(O.S.)
    Once upon a time there was a man.

Kyle turns.  No one’s there.  Huh.

He rubs his temples.  Takes a TYLENOL BOTTLE from his pocket, 
dry-swallows a couple of TABS.

             WOMAN
	(O.S.)
	(CONT’D)
    He was sad and alone.

He turns again... and sees MARLEY PHELPS (20’s), standing 
around a headstone behind Kyle.  She looks familiar.

             KYLE
    Do I know you?

Marley shifts, looks around.  He’s definitely talking to her.          
She shakes her head.  No.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    Did you say something?

             MARLEY
    I didn’t think you’d hear me.

             KYLE
    “Once upon a time?”  Was that you?

             MARLEY
    I... tell stories.  For kids mostly.

             KYLE
    You write children’s books?

She thinks on that.  Nods, smiles.

             MARLEY
    I write children’s books.

                                      9.

Kyle studies her.  She’s a little strange.

             MARLEY
	(CONT’D)
    You must have the worst headache.

How the...? Oh, the bottle of Tylenol in his hand.

             MARLEY
	(CONT’D)
    You should eat.  It’s time for lunch.

             KYLE
    I... guess it is.

She waits.  Expectant.  When Kyle says nothing:

             MARLEY
    Now you.

             KYLE
    What?



She's patient.  Kyle’s confused.

             MARLEY
    Okay, I’ll do it.  Let’s get lunch.

             KYLE
    Oh.  Thanks.  But I can’t.

             MARLEY
    He smiles and says, “That sounds 
    fun.”

             KYLE
    Strange conversation we’re having.

             MARLEY
    He smiles and says, “That sounds 
    fun.”

Marley waits, then:

             MARLEY
	(CONT’D)
    He says...


It’s so weird, Kyle cracks a smile, and:

             KYLE
    That sounds fun?

             MARLEY
    It does, doesn’t it?

                                     10.

EXT. PUBLIC PARK POND - LATER

Kyle and Marley crumble their left-over SANDWICH BREAD.

             KYLE
    Since when is there a pond here?

She shrugs.  Then squeals as a DUCK snaps at the bread in her 
fingers.  He studies her face.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    I do know you.  We've met.

Marley looks at him as if he's gone mental.

             MARLEY
    We have.  About an hour ago.  I was 
    there, you were there...

             KYLE
    Now you're just making fun of me.

             MARLEY
    Yes.


INT. KYLE'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

Kyle sits on the floor, stares at an OPEN BOX in front of him, 
jaw tight.  One of his hands is in a FIST.

In the box: Kimberly’s belongings found in the car the night
of the accident.  Purse, shoes, scarf.

He picks up the DISCO BALL ORNAMENT, looks at it as it dangles 
from his fingers.

Lydia walks in.

             KYLE
    I hated this stupid thing.

             LYDIA
    Kyle.  Don’t.

             KYLE
    I need to put these things away.

             LYDIA
    Leave them.  I’ll do it.

             KYLE
    Her mother wants--

Lydia closes the lid.  Puts the box in the closet.

                                     11.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    How are we supposed to do this, Mom?

             LYDIA
    We keep going, best we can.  Let time 
    heal what we can’t.  

She starts to head out...

             LYDIA
	(CONT’D)
    I brought some dinner.  Come down.

She leaves him alone.

Kyle looks at his clenched fist.  Opens his fingers.

Kimberly’s ENGAGEMENT RING twinkles in his palm.

EXT. CEMETERY - DAYS LATER

Kyle places more flowers on Kim’s grave.

He lingers, reads tombstones.  

Notices a small one.  Moves closer.

LAURA PHELPS, REST WELL SWEET ANGEL

             MARLEY
	(O.S.)
    My sister.


Kyle’s startled.  Turns to her.

             MARLEY
	(CONT’D)
    She was my hero.  Loved me just the 
    way I was.  Didn’t matter to her if I 
    was different.  Or sensitive.  I 
    wanted to be just like her.

             KYLE
    How old were you when she--

             MARLEY
    Just turned twelve.  Twins.

He looks at the dates on the stone.

             MARLEY
	(CONT’D)
    Identical, in almost every way.

             KYLE
    What happened?

                                     12.

             MARLEY
    Oh, I don’t tell sad stories anymore.  
    I’m happy to see you again.  Walk?

EXT. PARK - LATER

             MARLEY
    Shoot.  I forgot to bring bread.

             KYLE
    There should be a...

Kyle immediately spots a HOT DOG VENDOR.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    There.  We’ll buy some. 

She smiles like he created the vendor out of thin air.

EXT. POND - LATER

Marley feeds one of the ducks. 

Kyle watches a RED MONARCH BUTTERFLY flutter on the far side 
of the pond.  Wings damaged, it struggles to stay airborne. 

             MARLEY
    You said she was your friend.  But 
    she was more, wasn’t she?

The Monarch painfully flies across the pond... toward them.

             KYLE
    Yeah, she was more.

The butterfly’s almost there.  Closer... closer...

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    But she didn’t make it.

Wings fail.  The Monarch drops onto the water’s surface near 
the shore.  Struggles.

Kyle gently scoops it up.  His eyes drop to the water.  Hold 
up - something’s not right.

The pond’s surface reflects an overhanging TREE BRANCH.  Kyle 
glances up, sees the branch right above him.  Looks back down, 
sees its reflection...

But not himself.  He moves closer to the water’s surface.  
Nothing.  Like he’s not even there.

What.  The.  FUCK?

                                     13.

Marley pretend-shoves him, breaks the moment.  She laughs.

The butterfly falls from Kyle’s hand, drifts away.

             MARLEY
    Oh, poor thing.

He looks again into the water.  Now his reflection’s there. 

Marley leans over his shoulder, peers into the water-mirror.

             MARLEY
	(CONT’D)
    You look like a prince.  

INT. KYLE’S KITCHEN - THAT NIGHT

Kyle rolls pasta around a fork.

             LYDIA
    Sounds like a nice girl, so what’s 
    going on inside that head of yours?

             KYLE
    I barely know her, but it's... she’s 
    so easy to be with.  But, Kim.

             LYDIA
    Kimberly would want you to be happy.

             KYLE
    Would she?  I told her... I told her 
    it would be forever.

             LYDIA
    Oh, honey.  That’s not fair.

But for Kyle, the conversation’s over.

EXT. PARK

Kyle walks, looks around.  Finally, he sees her.  

Marley plucks BUDS from a cherry tree, uses her dress as a 
basket. 

She sees him, stares for a beat, then lets the blooms fall to 
the ground.

             MARLEY
    You’ve decided not to see me.

Kyle stops.  How did she...?

                                     14.

             MARLEY
	(CONT’D)
    I’m not surprised.  Just sad.

             KYLE
    I’ve just lost someone.  I’m sorry, 
    Marley.  It’s not you.  It’s...

A BREEZE blows a swirl of blossoms from the tree.  Marley 
watches them drift to the grass, joining her dropped buds.

Kyle starts to go, but... she looks devastated.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
           (gives in)
    We can be friends, can’t we?

A moment... then she brightens.

             MARLEY
    We’ll be friends.

Another WIND GUST, and blossoms surround her.  She smiles at 
him through the whirl of petals.

It’s magical.

INT. KYLE’S BEDROOM - LATER

Kyle tosses his jacket onto the bed.  A CHERRY BLOSSOM falls 
from the fabric.  He picks it up.  Smiles.

He places it next to a PICTURE of Kimberly on his night stand.

INT. KYLE’S BEDROOM - LATE THAT NIGHT

A phone rings.  Kyle’s groggy, reaches for the cordless.  But 
that’s not doing the ringing.

RING RING.  He gets up, grabs his cell.  Nope.

RING RING.  Where?  Wait... no.  No.

He moves to KIMBERLY’s PURSE, opens it.  RING RING.  Her cell.  
The caller ID: UNKNOWN.

             KYLE
    Hello?


Crackles... distant voices... buzzing.  Through static:

             PHONE
	(V.O.)
    Can... ear me?  Come on... have to...

                                     15.

             KYLE
    Who is this?

The line goes dead - the phone’s out of juice.  Kyle pulls his 
cell’s charger, plugs it into Kim’s phone. 

He sits in a chair, stares at the phone... and waits.

MORNING

Kyle wakes.  He’s back in bed.  Reaches for Kim’s cell.  It’s 
not there.

Wait... what?

He gets out of bed, looks for her purse.  

It’s not where he left it.  Only one place left to look.

CLOSET

The box.  Kyle hesitates.  Pulls back the lid.

Kimberly’s stuff: scarf, shoes, and... her PURSE.

Kyle grabs it.  Her phone’s inside. 

He checks the call history: NO NEW CALLS.  He throws the phone 
onto the bed.  Shit!

EXT. JOGGING TRAIL - THAT DAY

Kyle runs, Sam barely keeps up.

             SAM
    That’s some shit, dude.

             KYLE
    Swear it wasn’t you?

             SAM
    Some sick prank?  Jesus.  No way.  

Kyle stops.  Sam pants.

             KYLE
    What then?  Think it has something to 
    do with... you know... 

He points to his head.

             SAM
    Okay.  Hang on.  You woke up in your 
    bed.  It was a dream.  

                                     16.

             SAM
	(CONT'D)
    An effed-up dream, but that’s all.  
    Your head’s fine.  You’re okay.  

INT. BATHROOM - LATER

It’s steaming.  Kyle steps from the shower.  Wipes fog from 
the mirror.  As he wipes...

FLASHBACK - CAR

He angrily wipes fog from the car’s windshield.

             KYLE
    Damn it.


END FLASHBACK

Kyle shakes away the memory.  Stares at himself.  Pushes back 
his long hair to reveal: a RED SCAR at his hairline.

He traces it.  Tugs at his hair.  Too long.

EXT. PARK - DAYS LATER

Kyle’s got a new haircut.  Marley studies the scar.

             MARLEY
    Does it hurt?

             KYLE
    Bad headaches, and sometimes things 
    are... strange.
           (beat)
    They said the accident could’ve been 
    worse.  I’m not so sure about that.

             MARLEY
    What happened?

             KYLE
    Kimberly... it was the night she... 

             MARLEY
    Oh.  Don’t say any more.  It’s okay.

             KYLE
    I think I need to talk about it.

Marley waits.  Finally:

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    It was raining.  Really coming down.  
    I was driving.  We were fighting.

                                     17.

LATER

Kyle’s finished his story.  They sit in silence, until...

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    Didn’t mean to lay all that on you.

             MARLEY
    It’s good.  Knowing these things 
    about you.  Knowing you.

A nice quiet between them.  Then:

             KYLE
    Let’s get out of here.

LATER

They walk.  The mood’s lighter.

             KYLE
    I was the editor of my college paper.  
    Wanted to be a journalist. 

             MARLEY
    You gave it up?  Why?

             KYLE
    I don’t know anymore.  It’s the only 
    thing I was ever good at.

             MARLEY
    You should do it.  Be a writer.  Then 
    we’ll both be storytellers. 

             KYLE
    You’re a good listener, Marley.  I’m 
    glad I met you.

             MARLEY
    Me, too.  I like having a friend.

             KYLE
    You have friends.

             MARLEY
    None who talk with me the way you do.

INT. GROCERY STORE

Kyle’s at the MEAT COUNTER.  To the BUTCHER:

                                     18.

             KYLE
    Rib-eye.  Two please, fresh cut.  
    Special night tonight.

             BUTCHER
    You got it.

             LYDIA
	(O.S.)
    Kyle? 


Kyle looks, doesn’t see her.  Huh. Turns back to the counter.

THUMP.  The butcher drops the ribsteak onto the SLICER.

The butcher’s shadow is against the wall, following his 
movements.  As he puts his hands on the machine, the shadow 
does too.  But: they’re not totally in sync.  Kyle sees it.

The butcher leans over the machine.  The shadow leans also: 
but LONG HAIR flows over the silhouette’s shoulder.

The electric blade spins up.  There’s no WHIR sound.  Instead: 
the SCHLURP of sucking fluid, the SWHOOF of expelled air.

The shadow’s arm reaches for the slicer...

...and Kyle feels FINGERS through his hair.  He whirls.  
Lydia.  Her hand in mid-air.

             LYDIA
	(CONT’D)
    I’m sorry.  I thought you heard me.

Kyle glances back at the butcher.  BZZRD - the man makes a 
cut.  The machine sounds normal.  His shadow’s normal.

             KYLE
    Man, I am losing it.

             LYDIA
    Still fuzzy?

             KYLE
    I’m so sick of this, mom.

             LYDIA
    My poor boy--

THUD.  The butcher drops the packed meat onto the counter.

             LYDIA
	(CONT’D)
           (to Kyle)
    Who are these for?

                                     19.

INT. DINING ROOM - THAT EVENING

Kyle, Marley, and Lydia sit at the table.  Eating, laughing.

             MARLEY
    And Smelly Kelly rode away on her 
    bicycle made of feathers, never to be 
    heard from again.

Lydia applauds, catches Kyle watching Marley.  Likes it.

KITCHEN

Kyle helps Lydia load the dishwasher.  They speak low.

             LYDIA
    Can we keep her?

             KYLE
    Mom, I told you, it’s not--

             LYDIA
    Yes it is.  And it’s good. 

KNOCK.  KNOCK.  The back door.

Sam lets himself in.  Holds a SIX-PACK.

             SAM
    Hey.  Thought we could hang.  
           (beat)
    Am I interrupting something?

             LYDIA
    We’re just having dinner with Marley.

             SAM
    Who’s Marley?

EXT. PUBLIC PARK FIELD - AFTERNOON

Kyle, Sam, other MEN play rough touch football.  They form up 
for another play.

             SAM
    It’s just like changing channels for 
    you, isn’t it?  

             KYLE
    Leave it alone, Sam. 

Kyle calls the play.  The men scuffle around the field.  

Sam walks through the play, his back to Kyle.  

Kyle fires the ball, hits Sam in the head.  Sam turns, shoves.  

             SAM 
    How many times she break up with you?  

He twists his fists in Kyle’s collar.

                                     20.

             SAM
	(CONT’D)
    Seven.  Seven times since we were in 
    the ninth grade-- 

             KYLE
    And she was about to do it again.  
    But she died.  What am I supposed to 
    do?  Pine forever?  Stop breathing?

Sam backs off.

             SAM
    Kimberly was too good for you. 

He stalks off the field.

EXT. POND - AFTERNOON

Kyle lies on the grass, lost in thought.  Marley studies him.

             MARLEY
    What are you thinking so hard about?

             KYLE
    She’s really gone.

His hair looks so shiny in the sun.  She reaches out... plucks 
a DANDELION instead.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    And now Sam.  Shit.

             MARLEY
    It’s hard to be the one who messes 
    up.

           (off his look)
    I did it again, said too much.

             KYLE
    No, it’s... I swear it’s like you’re 
    speaking my thoughts or something.

             MARLEY
    Sorry.


                                     21.

             KYLE
    Don’t be sorry.  You understand me.  
    In a weird sort of way.

Marley flinches.  Turns away, she pulls a piece of her long 
hair into her mouth.  Chews nervously.

             MARLEY
    I don’t like that word.  Weird.

             KYLE
    I wasn’t saying you’re weird.  Wait, 
    are you weird?

He’s teasing.  She sniffs her flower.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    You are, aren’t you?

He loops a finger into the hair, tugs it from her lips.

             MARLEY
    I’m scared.

             KYLE
    Of me?

             MARLEY
    You look at me and you see me.  I 
    don’t know what that means.

             KYLE
    Not following.

             MARLEY
    No one really sees me.

The sun beams around her.  She’s beautiful.

             KYLE
    How could anyone not see you?

INT. DEPARTMENT STORE

Lydia and Kyle roam the Men’s section.  She picks a BLAZER.

             LYDIA
    Try this one on.  You want to look 
    casual but professional.

Kyle shrugs on the jacket.

             KYLE
    Sam’s right.  I am moving too fast.

                                     22.

             LYDIA
    What does Sam know?

             KYLE
    He was in love with Kim.

Lydia looks at him.  She knew that. She adjusts the collar.

             LYDIA
    I watched you with Kimberly since you 
    were ten years old.  Once you set 
    your heart on Kim, no one else would 
    do.  One thing I know about you, 
    you’re a hopeless romantic. 

             KYLE
    Mom--

             LYDIA
    You’ve got a lot of days ahead of 
    you.  They could all be like this 
    one.  Or, you could take a chance.  
    Set your heart on someone else.

Kyle’s silent.

             LYDIA
	(CONT’D)
    Here’s another thing I know.  You’ve 
    never been a coward.  You fight for 
    what you want.  Question now is: what 
    do you want?

             KYLE
           (beat)
    You really can railroad a guy.

             LYDIA
    I'm your mother.  That's what I do.

INT. LIVING ROOM

Kyle and Marley are on the sofa.

             MARLEY
    Told you!  I’m always right.

             KYLE
    I just showed him some editorials I 
    wrote in college, and bam.  Hired.

             MARLEY
    You’re a wonderful writer.

                                     23.

             KYLE
    You haven’t read anything I’ve 
    written.

             MARLEY
    I don’t need to.

She impulsively touches his chin, but pulls back right away.  
Her fingers go to her own mouth.  Her lips quiver.

He freezes.  Has anything so innocent ever been so sexy?

             MARLEY
	(CONT’D)
    My stomach’s all fluttery.

Kyle’s captivated, but... he takes her hands.

             KYLE
    Marley...


             MARLEY
    Don’t you feel that?

He does, but...

             KYLE
    I’m sorry.  It’s too soon.

She slumps, stands to leave.

             MARLEY
    Okay.  I’ll go.

             KYLE
    You don’t have to leave.

At the door she turns back.

             MARLEY
    I’ll wait for you, Kyle.

BEDROOM - LATER

Kyle yanks back the covers, crawls under.  

He tosses, opens his eyes.  Stares at the PHOTO OF KIMBERLY.  

Slides out of bed, walks over to the closet door.  Opens it.  
Looks at something on the floor.

Kimberly’s belongings.

                                     24.

KITCHEN - NEXT MORNING

KNOCK.  KNOCK.  Lydia.

             LYDIA
    Are you sure, honey?

Kyle moves aside to let her in.  He turns, picks up the box.  

             KYLE
    I’m sure. 


Lydia hugs her son, takes the box.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    And this.


The engagement ring.  Lydia takes it.

             LYDIA
    My brave man.  I love you.

EXT. CEMETERY

Kyle finds Sam putting flowers on Kim’s grave.

Sam turns.  Busted.  He runs his hand along the gravestone.

             SAM
    Marley.  She makes you happy?

A long beat.

             KYLE
    I’m not going to give up the rest of 
    my life.  Kim wouldn’t want me to.

             SAM
    I know.  Christ.  Let’s get a beer.

EXT. PARK - A FEW DAYS LATER

Kyle holds a LARGE YELLOW KITE.  Passes it to Marley.

She runs.  Tries to get the kite to grab air.  She lets go.  
It drags behind her.

She turns with a pout.

             MARLEY
    We need some...

             KYLE
    ...wind or something.

                                     25.

A GUST sweeps by, tugs at the kite.  Yes!

Kyle hands her the REEL.  She lets the STRING run through her 
fingers.  The kite soars.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    That’s it.


He moves behind her, guides her hands.  

The kite yanks toward the sky.  Her fingers loosen. 

It starts to slip away...

Kyle wraps his hand around hers.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    You’re supposed to hold onto it.

             MARLEY
    But it's trying so hard to get away.  
    Shouldn’t we let it go?

             KYLE
    No, that’s the whole point.

             MARLEY
    But it looks so sad.

He gives the kite a confused look.  Ummm... Okay.

Marley sulks.  Reels in the kite.

             MARLEY
	(CONT’D)
           (whispers to kite)
    Sorry.

PARK - LATER THAT DAY

Marley and Kyle walk.  He reaches out.  Their fingers touch... 
and he takes her hand.  She stops.

             KYLE
    Okay?

             MARLEY
    Yes.  Very.



They cross a SMALL STREET that cuts by the pond.

CHILDREN play in the park around them. 

             MARLEY
	(CONT’D)
    I’m really glad you and Sam made up.

                                     26.

             KYLE
    Marley.  Men don’t “make up.”  We 
    just kind of say, “Dude, you know how 
    it is” and “that’s all right, man.”  

             MARLEY
    That’s not making up?

             KYLE
    Nope.


He pulls her to a stop.  Gathers his courage, leans in. 

She raises her face, catches her breath...

Their lips touch.  The gentlest of kisses.  He pulls away.

             MARLEY
    That was--


Suddenly: her eyes widen.  She jerks away.

She rushes into the street, grabs a GIRL (5) off the blacktop.

Kyle trots toward her.  What the hell?

Marley marches fiercely toward the other kids.  She sets the 
little girl down, grabs another GIRL (12) by the shoulders.

             MARLEY
	(CONT’D)
    Is this your sister?

The girl nods, frightened.

             KYLE
    Marley? 


             MARLEY
           (to the girl)
    You’re supposed to watch out for her.  
    Do you know what can happen if she 
    runs into the street like that?  You 
    have to always protect her.  That’s 
    your job.
           (coming unhinged)
    What if she... what if...

             KYLE
    Marley.


             MARLEY
           (to the girl)
    She could have been killed.  Your 
    mother would hate you for that.

                                     27.

The MOTHER storms in.

             MOTHER
    Take your hands off my daughter.  

             MARLEY
    You let her run into the street.

The kids are scared.  Crying.  The mom’s furious.  Kyle’s 
confused, concerned.

             KYLE
    Marley.  Stop.

She pulls away from him and runs.

             MOTHER
    She’s crazy.

EXT. CEMETERY - MOMENTS LATER

Marley slumps next to her sister’s grave.  Kyle goes to her.

             MARLEY
    You can leave now, I know you want 
    to.

             KYLE
    I’m not going anywhere. 

             MARLEY
    I didn’t mean for it to happen, I 
    swear.  I miss her so much.

             KYLE
    Tell me.


             MARLEY
    No sad stories.

             KYLE
    Just this once?

Marley runs her fingers around a RUBY PENDANT she wears.

             MARLEY
    I always wore yellow.  No matter 
    what.  Yellow made me feel good.  
    Like sunshine.
           (beat)
    I was a weird kid.  Not like Laura.  
    Daddy said I was sensitive, but Mom 
    said... 

             MAR LEY
	(CONT'D)
    I always knew she loved Laura more, 
    but that was okay, ‘cause I loved her 
    more, too.

                                     28.

INT. GIRL’S ROOM - FLASHBACK

Marley (12) and LAURA (12) speak, hushed.

             LAURA
    It’s just for today.

Laura’s decked out in BRIGHT YELLOW.  

             MARLEY
    But my yellow.

             LAURA
    Keep your ribbon.  This way you’ll 
    still have yellow, but everyone will 
    think you’re me, and I’m you.  

Marley’s not convinced.  She pulls a lock of hair into her 
mouth.  Chews.

             LAURA
	(CONT’D)
    I’ll take care of Ben Pope and nobody 
    will ever mess with you again.  Ever.

Laura sweetly plucks the strands from her sister’s lips.

EXT. SCHOOL BUS STOP - JUST OUTSIDE THEIR HOUSE

The girls wait for the bus in each other’s clothes.  Parked 
cars line the quiet street.

Laura’s excited.  Marley, not so much.

             MARLEY
    Nobody’s going to believe I’m you.

             LAURA
    Yes, they will.  Oh, shoot.

She unlatches her necklace - the RUBY PENDANT.

             LAURA
	(CONT’D)
    We forgot these.  Give me yours.

Marley removes her own YELLOW SAPPHIRE PENDANT, hands it over.  
Works at getting Laura’s necklace around her own neck.

Laura grumbles.  Marley sees that her necklace is caught in 
her sister’s hair.  Laura tugs the necklace...  

                                     29.

...it flies from her hand, lands in the street.  

Both girls laugh.

Marley clasps the ruby around her own neck.  She looks up:  

Laura’s leaning between two parked cars to get the necklace.

That’s when Marley sees the CAR.  Laura steps into the 
street...

             MARLEY
    Laura!


Tires SCREECH.  A THUD.

The DRIVER jumps out.  

             DRIVER
    I didn’t see her.  Oh, my God!

Marley’s MOTHER rushes from the house.  Runs to Laura.  Tries 
to tend to her daughter... it’s no use.  She’s gone.

She pulls the girl’s broken body into her arms, howls.

Marley stands over Laura and her mother.

             MARLEY
    I’m sorry.  I’m sorry.

The woman grabs onto Marley, clutches her like a lifeline.

             MARLEY’S MOM
    Oh, God.

             MARLEY
           (crying)
    Sorry.

             MARLEY’S MOM
    Oh, Laura.  Sweetheart.  Thank God it 
    wasn’t you.

The child in her arms stiffens.

The mom gets a good look at her face.  Oh, no.

The light goes right out of Marley’s eyes.  Her spirit 
fades... then blinks out. 

             MARLEY’S MOM
	(CONT’D)
    Oh, no.  No, baby.  Marley.    

                                     30.

Nothing.

             MARLEY’S MOM
	(CONT’D)
    Marley?


EXT. CEMETERY - END FLASHBACK

             MARLEY
    I went to a hospital.  It got dark.  
    I don’t remember much after it got 
    dark.  Just the hospital.  And the 
    plants, they let me water the plants.
           (beat)
    I should’ve put the necklace on her.  
    I’m so stupid.  Stupid and broken.

             KYLE
    It’s not your fault.  Look at me.

Her eyes meet his.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    You are not stupid.  Or broken.  
    You’re... perfect to me.

She looks at him, unwilling to believe...

             MARLEY
    You’re really staying?

             KYLE
    I’m staying.  

Marley wipes her eyes.  He takes her hand, kisses her fingers.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    No more sad stories.  I promise.

INT. KITCHEN

On the table, remnants of a nice dinner.  

LIVING ROOM

Candles flicker.  Soft music plays. 

Kyle tends a FIRE.  Nervously adjusts the logs just so.  Looks 
around the room.

There’s an overwhelming romantic vibe.

             KYLE
    I’m just realizing this is so staged.  
    Seduction super-cheese. 

                                     31.

Marley takes it in.  Kyle moves to sit beside her.  

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    I wanted it to be perfect for you.  
    This seemed, well...

             MARLEY
    I love what you’ve done.

Marley shyly touches his face.  His scar.

             MARLEY
	(CONT’D)
    I’m not the only mind-reader.

BEDROOM

They’re on the bed, half-dressed.  Heavy petting.

Marley wrenches her mouth from Kyle’s.  Takes deep breaths.

             KYLE
    You okay?

             MARLEY
    Oh, yes.  I just...

             KYLE
    What?


Suddenly she’s self-conscious.  Self-conscious and wanton.  A 
heady mix.  Her fingers clench and unclench in his hair.

             MARLEY
    I didn’t know it would feel so good. 

Kyle studies her sweetly... kisses her again.

LATER

Kyle and Marley are curled together, asleep.  Blissful.  

Until Kyle twitches.  Moans.  Twitches again.

The SOUND of a car crash.

CUT TO: CAR

RAIN smacks against metal.  Kyle opens his eyes.

The rain drenches him through a gaping HOLE in the windshield. 
Flashing RED LIGHTS bounce off the DISCO BALL.

The reflected light makes it look like it’s raining blood.

                                     32.

He tries to move... he’s pinned.

Kimberly’s HAND is in his lap.  Red water pools in her palm.

             KYLE
    Kim?  Kimberly?  

Ringing on the car’s center console: a CELL PHONE.  It rings 
and vibrates its way across the console...

...until KYLE’S able to read the display: KIM CALLING

INT. KYLE’S BEDROOM

Kyle’s eyes pop open.  Damn. He shakes off the dream. 

He rolls over to Marley-- and looks into the face of Kimberly.  

             KIMBERLY
    Don’t do this.  Don’t let go.

Kyle snaps fully awake.  Marley wakes, reaches for him. 

             KYLE
    Kim, no--


             MARLEY
    It’s me.  Marley.  It’s all right.  
    It was only a dream.

             KYLE
    I saw Kim.  It was so real.  She’s 
    haunting me.

             MARLEY
    She’s not haunting you.

             KYLE
    I hear her in my head, talking to me.  
    Telling me to listen to her.

Marley puts her hand on Kyle’s cheek...

             MARLEY
    Look at me.  Kyle.

...she moves his head so that their eyes meet.

             MARLEY
	(CONT’D)
    Don’t listen to her.  Listen to me.

Kyle looks at her.  A beat.  He pulls her to him.

                                     33.

INT. A NEW HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - A YEAR LATER

Kyle walks Lydia to the front door.

             LYDIA
    Sure you have nothing to tell me?

             KYLE
    Um... love you?

             LYDIA
    Why thank you, dear.  Anything else?

His grin nearly busts his cheeks.

             KYLE
    She said yes!

             LYDIA
    Ha!


She smothers him in a hug.

Suddenly, he grabs his head as agony stabs through it.

             LYDIA
	(CONT’D)
    Kyle?  What is it?

The pain passes.  He relaxes.

             KYLE
    It’s fine.  I’m fine. 

             LYDIA
    How often does this happen?

             KYLE
    Just twinges now and then.  But 
    nothing like that.  I’m okay now.

             LYDIA
    No.  The accident was two years ago.  
    Get it checked out.  Please. 

             KYLE
    Okay.  Fine.  I will.

Kyle opens the front door.

             LYDIA
    Beautiful night.  Look at those 
    stars.

                                     34.

Kyle looks up.  One STAR shines brighter than the rest.  It 
twitches.  Swells.

Suddenly the star SURGES at him, its hot light consumes 
everything as it hurtles towards him.

FWOMP!  Silence.  Kyle’s... somewhere.  No ceiling, no floor.  
Just white.  In every direction.

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(O.S.)
    Hey, there.  You with me?

INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY

The whiteness drains away, the light fades.

             KYLE
    Sorry.  That was... so bright.

DR. BENEFIELD, the E.R. surgeon, releases his eyelid.  Pockets 
her pen-light. 

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Pupils are dilating fine.  You 
    haven’t hit your head?  Nothing?

             KYLE
    Um.  Not since the accident.

Benefield glances at an X-RAY IMAGE on a touch-screen tablet.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Scans are clean.   

             KYLE
    So I’m okay?

             DR. BENEFIELD
    I can’t explain the headaches and 
    that bothers me some, but there’s 
    nothing physically wrong with you.  
    So, I’ll tell you what I tell 
    everybody.  Try not to get too 
    stressed, get enough sleep - blah, 
    blah, blah.  You’re going to live a 
    good, long time. 

She writes out a scrip...  

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(CONT’D)
    Take these if the headaches get too 
    bad.  Don’t take too many at once, or 
    that whole “living a good, long time” 
    goes right out the window.

                                     35.

             KYLE
    Yes, ma’am.  Got it.

INT. KITCHEN - A FEW YEARS LATER

Marley, older and more beautiful, arranges PAPER-DOLL MAGNETS 
on the refrigerator.  Her wedding band sparkles.  

She hears the front door.  

             MARLEY
    You’re late.

             KYLE
    I have a surprise for you.

She looks at him, coy.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    Ha.  You’ll get that surprise later.

He sweeps her up, settles her on the island counter.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    Guess who got his own column?

             MARLEY
           (playful)
    Who?  

             KYLE
    Uh-huh.  That’s it.

He slings her over his shoulder, heads out the kitchen.

BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

Marley pants against Kyle’s chest.

             MARLEY
    I like this surprise game.  I want to 
    give you one.

             KYLE
    It’s your happily-ever-after.  You 
    can do whatever you want.

She reaches over the side of the bed.  Pulls up a GIFT.

Not what he expected, but okay.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    For me?


Marley nervously pulls some of her long hair into her mouth.  

He stops her with a smile. 

                                     36.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    I’m sure I’ll love it.

             MARLEY
    I hope so.  Because it’s done now.

Unwraps the present.  Freezes.

He tugs from the box a soft yellow BLANKET, a baby’s sleeper 
GOWN, and tiny SOCKS.

Silence.  Marley can’t stand it anymore.

             MARLEY
	(CONT’D)
    Do you like it?

             KYLE
    I love it.


BEDROOM - NINE MONTHS LATER

Marley sleeps on her side, Kyle behind her.  His hand rests on 
his wife’s ripe abdomen, protecting.  

NURSERY - ONE WEEK LATER

Marley sits in a rocking chair, nursing her newborn DAUGHTER.

             MARLEY
    Just like a baby doll.

Kyle’s at the doorway.

             MARLEY
	(CONT’D)
           (whispers to the baby)
    Elizabeth.  Daddy’s here.
           (to Kyle)
    We made her.

Kyle looks at his family.  Spellbound.  Takes Marley’s hand.

             KYLE
    How did I ever find you?

LIVING ROOM - SEVEN YEARS LATER

The room’s lit only by the twinkle of a Christmas tree.

Two gorgeous girls, ELIZABETH (7) and SARAH (4), chase one 
another around the room, sticking GIFT BOWS to each other.

                                     37.

Marley and Kyle, worn out, snuggle in a corner of the couch.

Kyle sees something.  Near the tree, on the wall behind the 
girls.  Two SHADOWS.  

They’re adult silhouettes, moving in silent conversation. 

             KYLE
    Girls.  Stop.  Be still.

The girls freeze.  Look to their father.

             MARLEY
    Oh let them be, they’ll wear 
    themselves out soon enough.

But Kyle looks past them, to the shadows.  Still moving.

He reaches over, turns on the lamp.

Light fills the room, but the shadows remain.

             KYLE
    Marley, do you--

The silhouettes freeze, their heads snap toward him.

And then they’re gone.

             MARLEY
    What? 


             KYLE
           (beat)
    It was nothing.  Let's get to bed.

GIRL’S ROOM - THAT NIGHT

Mom and Dad tuck in their angels.

             KYLE
    Night, sweethearts.

             MARLEY
    How much do I love you?

             ELIZABETH
    More than anything.

Marley can’t help but say it:

             MARLEY
    And I love you both the same.

                                     38.

             SARAH
    Love you, too, Mommy.

She strokes their heads.  Her self-control suddenly snaps.  

             MARLEY
           (urgently)
    And remember, always watch out for 
    each other...

Kyle tugs Marley from the room.

HALLWAY

             KYLE
    Baby, you’ve got to stop telling them 
    those things.  

             MARLEY
    That I love them?

             KYLE
    You know that’s not what I mean.

             MARLEY
    I’m so afraid of messing up.

             KYLE
    You won’t.  You won’t.

EXT. FRONT YARD - THREE YEARS LATER

Elizabeth (10), Sarah (7), and Marley are dressed as FAIRIES, 
wings and all.  They run around the yard waving their WANDS.

Kyle laughs from the porch.

             SARAH
    Come on, Daddy.  It’s fun.

             MARLEY
    They grow up so fast.

Marley flutters to the steps.  Plants a CROWN on his head.  

             KYLE
    There goes my manhood.

             MARLEY
    Play with us.  You have to.  You’re 
    my Prince Charming.

Sarah chases a BUTTERFLY: a red Monarch butterfly.  She’s 
almost got it... reaches out... just a foot from the street.

                                     39.

Marley stiffens.

             KYLE
    Sarah.  Not so close.

The Monarch flies away.  Sarah comes back into the yard.

Kyle watches the butterfly as it disappears into the sky.

EXT. STREET 

Kyle, briefcase in hand, gawks at a SIX FOOT WHITE PICKET 
FENCE that surrounds his entire property.  What the?

He walks around the fortress-like structure, finally locates a 
security DOOR. 

INT. LIVING ROOM

Kyle looks for Marley.

             KYLE
    Marley?  What’s with the fence?

He heads up the stairs.  Peeks into the girls’ room.  His 
daughters lie together on a bed, crying.

GIRLS’ ROOM

Kyle soothes the girls.

             KYLE
    What happened?  

             SARAH
    I didn’t mean to.  Our ball bounced 
    and then it was in the street.

The street.  Oh no.

             KYLE
    Where’s Mommy?

The girls cry harder.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    Where is she?

             ELIZABETH
    We can’t find her.

HOUSE - VARIOUS

Kyle frantically searches each room.  Nothing’s out of place.  

                                     40.

The only thing missing: Marley.

He races to the front door.

EXT. HOUSE

It’s dark out.  

Kyle steps into the yard.  Cold wind rips the trees, storm 
clouds churn overhead.

He crosses the yard, toward the street.  As he nears the 
pavement...

CRACK!  Lightning burns the clouds - down the street, a 
TRANSFORMER’s hit.

BOOM!  The transformer explodes in fireworks of sparks.  Then:

Pop... pop...

What’s that? Kyle fights to see through the hard wind.  

At the end of the block the STREET LIGHTS are popping off, one 
by one, the outage heading toward KYLE...

...pop... POP... POP...

Inky blackness rolls behind the popping lights, like a dark 
tidal wave surging toward him.

The light above him POPS out and darkness slams down on Kyle.

He tries to see through the night.  Holds out a hand.  His 
palm’s visible, but his fingers disappear into shadow.

             KYLE
    Marley!  Marley!

A small SCREAM, behind him.  It’s Sarah and Elizabeth, in the 
doorway, terrified.

Kyle runs back to the house, picks them up.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    Storm’s coming.  Let’s get tucked in.

             ELIZABETH
    I want Mommy.

             KYLE
           (beat)
    Me too, honey.

                                     41.

BEDROOM - LATER

Kyle lies on the bed, a child tucked in each arm.  He stares 
blankly at the ceiling.

The children stare blankly, too.

The sun comes up, goes down, and comes up again.  

All while they lie motionless.

KITCHEN

The kids eat Cheerios.  Kyle stares at his bowl, untouched.

GIRL’S ROOM

Kyle brushes Sarah’s hair.  Elizabeth sits at his feet.  Reads 
a children’s book.

Kyle glances at the pages as she turns them.

She gets to a page that’s been completely BLACKED OUT with a 
marker.  She flips past it.

             KYLE
    Wait.  That page.  Turn back.

She does.  It’s not blacked out at all.  Just an illustration 
of a duck pond.  Like the one Kyle and Marley visit.  How?

Elizabeth closes the book.  The cover: Liza Saves the World, 
by Marley Lafferty.

LIVING ROOM

Kyle watches as dust floats in the air.  His eyes track one 
mote, then another.  

The SCRAPE of a key.  The front door swings open.  Marley.

Kyle rushes for her.  Stops short.  Something’s off.

             KYLE
    Where have you been?

She shrugs.  He approaches slowly.  Gently embraces her.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    You’re freezing.  Where did you go?  

             MARLEY
    I don’t know.  

                                     42.

Kyle pulls her to the couch.  

             KYLE
    I came home and you weren’t here.  
    What happened?

             MARLEY
    It was... dark.  I don’t know.

             KYLE
    Honey help me out.  You disappeared. 

Marley sits.  Unblinking.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    Marley.

Nothing.  He snaps.


             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    You’ve been gone for two days.  Where 
    the fuck were you?

That gets her attention.

             MARLEY
    Don’t say that word to me.

             KYLE
    Then answer me.

             MARLEY
           (getting hysterical)
    I don’t know.  I don’t know.

             KYLE
    I’m sorry.

             MARLEY
    I don’t like when you yell.

             KYLE
    I’m not yelling now.  Help me 
    understand.  That fence...

             MARLEY
    Something happened.  I needed a 
    fence. 

             KYLE
    The girls told me.

             MARLEY
    And you still love me?

                                     43.

Such a simple question.  

             KYLE
    God, honey.  Yes.

She flies into his arms.  

BEDROOM

Kyle watches Marley sleep.  

She opens her eyes.  Stares into his.

             MARLEY
    You're leaving me.

             KYLE
    What?  Marley, no.  I’m not leaving.

But it’s clear she doesn’t believe him.

LATER

Kyle wakes.  Alone.  Oh, no.  

He tries to stay calm.  Slips from the bed. 

GIRLS’ ROOM

Kyle’s in the doorway.  Marley lies on one of the beds, curled 
up with both girls wrapped around her.

Her broken whispers drift into the hall.

             MARLEY
    I love you.  I love you.  I love you.

HOME OFFICE - DAYS LATER

The girls play a BOARD GAME on the floor.

Kyle types on his laptop.  The screen flickers.  Shit.

He checks the power plug in the back.  It’s fine.

But behind the laptop, peeking out underneath: some PAPERS.

He pulls them out.  They’re ILLUSTRATIONS - all scribbled 
through with a black marker.

             KYLE
    Elizabeth.  You do this?

                                     44.

             ELIZABETH
    No.


             SARAH
    Mommy did that.  It’s her new book.

Kyle stares at the pages.

             KYLE
           (calls out)
    Marley?

STAIRS

He heads up the stairs.  Stops.  

There’s a BRIGHT YELLOW PILL on the step.  What the hell?

Two more steps.  A PINK TABLET.  Then a GREEN, two RED.

HALL

Outside the bedroom door there’s an empty PILL BOTTLE.  He 
picks it up.  No label.  Empty.

BEDROOM

Dozens more empty bottles are piled on the bed.  All empty.

He looks around.  The bathroom door.  Closed.

No.  Please, God.

He rushes to it.  Locked.  He pounds on the door.

             KYLE
    Marley!


A mumble from inside.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    Open the door.

Marley cracks the door and slips through, one fist clenched.  

             MARLEY
    What?  I didn’t want to be 
    interrupted.

He grabs her by the shoulders.  Notices her closed hand.  
Pries it open.  More pills.

He tries to take them but her hand shuts tight.

                                     45.

             KYLE
    How many did you take?

             MARLEY
    Why are you mad?

He tries to force open her hand.

             MARLEY
	(CONT’D)
    Don’t.  I need those.

             KYLE
    Where did you get all these?

             MARLEY
    They’re pills.

             KYLE
    I know they’re pills, Marley.  

             MARLEY
    They’re mine.

             KYLE
    How many did you take?

             MARLEY
    Stop it.

             KYLE
    How many?

             MARLEY
    All of them.

She jerks back into the bathroom.  Slams and locks the door.

             KYLE
    Marley!  Damn it.

He beats against the door.  Stands back, kicks at the knob.  

CRACK!

BATHROOM

Inside, Marley’s kneeling, completing her task.  She turns, 
scowls at the ruined door.

             MARLEY
    Look at what you did.

But Kyle’s looking at the floor.

                                     46.

On the marble: an immaculate MOSAIC OF A STARGAZER LILY.  

Made completely of pills.

INT. HOSPITAL

Kyle seems lost in the emergency room crowd.  He’s looking for 
someone.  Moves to the nurses’ station.

             KYLE
    I’m looking for Dr. Benefield.

             NURSE
    Her office is in the medical plaza.

The nurse looks over Kyle’s shoulder.

             NURSE
	(CONT’D)
    Lucky you.


Benefield pulls a SCRUB CAP off her head. 

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Kyle.  Headaches again?

             KYLE
    It’s my wife.

HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

Benefield strides down the hall.  Kyle struggles to keep up.

             DR. BENEFIELD 
    How many did she take?

             KYLE
    None.  Technically.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    You should talk to a psychiatrist.  
    You don’t want a neurosurgeon telling 
    you how to think.  Believe me.

             KYLE
    You’re the only doctor I know.

Kyle peeks into the passing rooms, filled with injured people.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    I’ll be happy to recommend someone.  
    In fact, I’ve got a good friend...

Her voice fades.  It suddenly sounds as though Kyle’s hearing 
Benefield through a waterfall.

                                     47.

Other hospital sounds filter through the roar.  There’s a 
steady BEEPING.  Also, the muffled CONVERSATIONS of nurses.

             NURSE
	(O.S.)
    We won’t know anything until the 
    doctor returns.  She’ll be able to...

A woman cries.  Hushed tones of sympathy.

             FEMALE DOCTOR
	(O.S.)
    It may be a few weeks.  It may be 
    longer.  It’s just too early to tell.

Kyle passes another room.  Catches sight of a WOMAN leaning 
over a wreck of a MAN.  One leg hangs in traction.  The 
patient’s head is heavily bandaged.

Kyle’s vision goes blurry, dim.  He tries to shake it off.

His legs turn lead-heavy, fighting each step.

             KYLE
           (croaks)
    Dr. Benefield.

His knees hit the floor.  Benefield turns, runs to him.  Kyle 
can barely see her.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    What is it?


             KYLE
    Can’t... I can’t... see.

INT. MRI MACHINE

Kyle stares at the slick white interior of the MRI.  The 
machine scans his brain, CLICKS echo in surround sound.

             KYLE
    I told you it’s fine now.

Benefield’s tinny voice filters in from a speaker:

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(O.S.)
    Be still.  Go to your happy place.

INT. HOSPITAL OFFICE

On an LCD screen, Benefield shows Kyle his MRI results.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Nothing abnormal.  Or if there is, I 
    can’t find it.

                                     48.

             KYLE
    Then there’s nothing wrong.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    The scan says no, but... we can’t 
    pretend to know exactly what goes on 
    in the human brain.  There’s still so 
    much we’re finding out.
           (re: the scan)
    Something is hiding from me, and I 
    don’t like it.

INT. GIRLS’ ROOM - LATER THAT DAY

Kyle’s in the doorway, stunned.

All the furniture’s crammed into one corner.  A large paint-
spattered TARP covers the carpet. 

Brightly-colored small, medium, and large hand and footprints 
climb one wall.  The opposite wall’s smeared with artful 
juvenile body splats.

Is that a purple butt mark?  

He presses his palm against one of the tiny handprints.

He squinches his eyes shut.  Rubs his temples.

             KYLE
    Ow, damn.


BATHROOM

Kyle steps into the bathroom.  His family’s in the tub.

They look like a set of Russian Nesting Dolls.  Three matching 
human angels, each one smaller than the next. 

Marley and the girls are up to their necks in bubbles.   

Streaks of paint run across their necks and shoulders.  They 
giggle.  Innocent.  Beautiful.

He hears a slight pounding in his ears.

             MARLEY
    Hey, you.  Come here.

             ELIZABETH
    Daddy.  We decorated our room.

Kyle chuckles.  Painfully.  It hurts.

                                     49.

             KYLE
    I saw that.  

Pain stabs through his head.  His eyes close.

             MARLEY
    Kyle?


Blood roars in his ears.  

             MARLEY
	(CONT’D)
    Honey?

His knees buckle.


             MARLEY
	(CONT’D)
    Kyle!


She scrambles from the tub.  The girls whimper.

Marley rushes to Kyle.  He looks into her face.

CUT TO: FUTURE

Marley’s in her 40’s.  She lays that winning smile on him.

             MARLEY
    Kyle, he’s only a boy.  

Elizabeth, a lovely teen, glowers at him.

             ELIZABETH
    This is so not fair.

Marley whispers in his ear.

             MARLEY
    It’s her first date, behave yourself.

CUT TO: PRESENT

A wet, naked Marley cradles Kyle’s head.

             MARLEY
    Please don’t do this.

FUTURE

Kyle dips Marley in a sweeping flourish.  Both in their late 
40’s.  He captures her lips in a passionate kiss.  

Sarah, a half-grown rebel, turns up her nose.

             SARAH
    Oh, God.  Spare me.  

A laughing Kyle lunges for his daughter, who squeals and runs.

                                     50.

PRESENT

The children cry.

             MARLEY
    No.  No, don’t go.  No more sad 
    stories.  You promised.

FUTURE

Kyle stands at the altar.  Elizabeth, the bride, on his arm.

             PREACHER
    Who gives this woman to be wed?

             KYLE
    Her mother and I do.

PRESENT

Kyle’s body seizes, his eyes roll back.

             KYLE
    Marley...


             MARLEY
    I’m right here.

FUTURE

Marley and Kyle, in their fifties, stand at the hospital 
bedside of Sarah, in her 20’s.

She holds a NEWBORN CHILD in her arms.

             KYLE
    Will you look at that.

PRESENT

Kyle goes limp.  

             MARLEY
    You said you wouldn’t leave me.

She cries, full of anguish.  The sound slowly mutates into a 
low-level HUM.  Her voice fades.

                                     51.

             MARLEY
	(V.O.)
    I love you. 

A mechanical hum.  Then into a rhythmic BEEP... BEEP... BEEP.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Kyle’s eyes open.  

His POV: intense light, two NURSES leaving the room.  

He tries raising his hand, fumbles with the IV in his arm.

             NURSE
	(O.S.)
    Left my pager.  Meet you down there.

Through watery eyes, Kyle sees the nurse re-enter.  His hand 
trembles mid-air.

             NURSE
	(CONT’D)
    Page Dr. Benefield! 

Kyle tries to speak.  But instead, slips back into darkness.

HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER

His eyes open again.  Benefield leans over him. 

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Welcome back, Mister.  You gave us 
    quite a scare.  Can you hear me?

Kyle tries to nod.  His head bobs like a marionette.  He tries 
to speak, throat like sandpaper.

             KYLE
    My--


             DR. BENEFIELD
    Don’t talk.  

             KYLE
           (rasps)
    My wife.

His... oh, her.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Don’t try to move.  I’ll get her.

She leaves.

Voices outside the room:

                                     52.

             WOMAN
	(O.S.)
           (tearfully)
    Can I talk to him?

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(O.S.)
    He won’t be able to carry on much of 
    a conversation, but he can hear you.

Benefield comes back in.

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(CONT’D)
    Someone’s very happy you’re awake.

A WOMAN comes into the room.

It can’t be.

KIMBERLY.  ALIVE.  Still 24 years old.

Her right arm’s in a sling, a fresh scar’s on her forehead.

She leans over to stroke his hair.

             KIMBERLY
    Hey.  Oh, my God.  Hey.

Kyle stares, eyes wide.  Disbelieving.  

Hand trembling... he reaches out.  No.  She can’t be here.

His fingertips touch her cheek.  She smiles.

He recoils.

             KYLE
           (fights to speak)
    N... no...

She holds his hand to her cheek, tears slide onto his fingers.

             KIMBERLY
    It’s okay.  You’re awake now. 

Kyle takes a gulping breath.  Lungs heave.  Eyes slide shut.

             KIMBERLY
	(V.O.)
    Kyle!


INT. KYLE’S AND MARLEY’S BEDROOM

Kyle lies on his bed.  Marley strokes his hair.  

             KYLE
    What happened?

                                     53.

             MARLEY
    You fell in the bathroom.

She clings to him.  

             MARLEY
	(CONT’D)
    I thought you were really gone.

INT. KYLE’S HOSPITAL ROOM - EVENING

Kyle’s eyes open.  The hospital.

His sees a vase: two Stargazer Lilies.  

Lydia sits in the bedside chair, talking softly, as if to 
herself.  Her hand absently strokes his arm.

She doesn’t notice he’s awake.

             LYDIA
    Looks like it might rain from now on.  
    It’s drowning my roses.  Someone 
    brought you lilies.  Pretty ones.

             KYLE
    Mom.


Lydia gasps.  Plants mommy-kisses all over his face.

             LYDIA
    I thought I’d never hear that again.

             KYLE
    What’s wrong?  

             LYDIA
    You’re in the hospital, honey.   

             KYLE
    I fell.  Hit my head, I think.

             LYDIA
           (beat)
    Do you remember anything?

Kyle looks confused.

             LYDIA
	(CONT’D)
    You were in a car accident, with Kim. 

             KYLE
    Mom, that was years ago.

Now Lydia’s confused.  Years ago?

             LYDIA
    You’ve been... asleep.  In a coma.

                                     54.

             KYLE
    What?  
           (beat)
    How long?

             LYDIA
    Five weeks.


             KYLE
    Where’s Marley?

             LYDIA
    Who?


Kyle blinks.  Wait.  

Accident.  Coma.  Five weeks.  That’s impossible.  

Wait...

FLASHBACK - CAR

Kyle drives.  Looks over at Kimberly.  

             KIMBERLY
    I love you, Kyle.  I do, but--

FLASHBACK - TRAUMA UNIT

Fluorescent lights overhead.

Kyle watches nurses work on Kimberly.

Benefield’s face leans over him...

             DR. BENEFIELD
    What do we have?

FLASHBACK - BEDROOM

Marley holds him close.

             MARLEY
    I thought you were really gone.

END FLASHBACKS - PRESENT

             KYLE
    I’ve gotta get out of here.

Kyle starts to sit up, but he can’t move his right leg.

                                     55.

He’s got a full CAST, hip to ankle.

             LYDIA
    It’s over now.  Things will be back 
    to normal in no time.  You’ll see.

He starts ripping the IVs from his hands.  Tries to stand.

             LYDIA
	(CONT’D)
    Nurse!  I need a nurse in here.

Kyle’s good leg crumples beneath him.  Lydia breaks his fall.

             LYDIA
	(CONT’D)
    Someone, please!

Two NURSES rush into the room.  

One injects Kyle with a SYRINGE.  They get him back into bed.

Kyle’s eyes slump, getting groggy...

             KYLE
    I don’t... Kimberly’s alive?

             LYDIA
    Of course she is, darling.  She’s 
    been here every day.  

Kyle fights the sedative, but it pulls him under.

KYLE’S HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER

Kyle’s upright in the bed.  Benefield reads his chart.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    I had no idea you were going to be so 
    much trouble.  
           (beat)
    Blurry vision?  Headache?  Dizziness?

She pulls the covers over Kyle’s plastered leg.

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(CONT’D)
    You have any idea how lucky you are 
    you didn’t re-injure this?

He ignores her.

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(CONT’D)
    Chart says they’re removing the cast 
    tomorrow.  Good news, huh?

Silence.

                                     56.

Finally:

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(CONT’D)
    Listen here, I’m pretty sure I didn’t 
    tinker with your vocal chords, and I 
    know you don’t have brain damage.  So 
    you want to explain the freak-out?

             KYLE
    This is not where I’m supposed to be.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Where else would you be?

He hesitates.  Should he?

THUNDERING FOOTSTEPS in the outside hall...

Sam bursts into the room.  He immediately breaks into a 
touchdown-style VICTORY DANCE.

             SAM
    Bro, you’re awake.  That’s what I’m 
    talking about. 

Sam sees Benefield.

             SAM
	(CONT’D)
    I’ll come back.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Oh, I don’t think so.  You stay right 
    here, Bro.
           (to Kyle)
    Any symptoms and you have one of the 
    nurses call me, got it?  

She heads out.

             SAM
    Dude, this is so--

             KYLE
    Thought maybe you’d be glad to be rid 
    of me.  

             SAM
           (beat)
    What kind of drugs they giving you?

             KYLE
    Is something going on?  With Kim.  
    And you?

                                     57.

             SAM
    What the hell, Kyle?  I’d never do 
    that to you.  Never.

Kyle reads his friend.  Sam’s telling the truth.

             KYLE
    Shit.


Sam relaxes.  Sits in the chair.

             SAM
    The hell did that come from?

LATER

Sam’s more than a little stunned.  

             SAM
    A hallucination, maybe.  Dream?  It 
    wasn’t real.

             KYLE
    It felt real.  Still feels real.  

             SAM
    Come on--


             KYLE
    What if I told you that nothing you 
    know is real: Kim, me, your parents--

             SAM
    Okay, that’s jacked up.
           (beat)
    Wait.  What about Kim?  Do you...?

Sam waits for the answer.

             KYLE
    That was twenty years ago. 

             SAM
    That was last month.  You best--

             KIMBERLY
	(O.S.)
    Hey, fellas.  This the party room?

Kimberly.  A duffle in hand.  Sam stands.

             SAM
    Yep.  Party room.  Whoop!

Kimberly chuckles... then starts to cry. 

             KIMBERLY
    God, Kyle, I was so scared.

Kyle stares, still can’t believe he’s seeing her again.

                                     58.

             KYLE
    Kim...


             KIMBERLY
    I know.  I know.

She rushes to the bed, hugs him.

Behind her, Sam motions for Kyle to hold her.  Kyle doesn’t.  
Kim lifts her head, wipes her tears.

             KIMBERLY
	(CONT’D)
    Look at me, blubbering.

She looks between the two of them.

             KIMBERLY
	(CONT’D)
    Were you two fussing?

             KYLE
    We were just--

             SAM
    Kyle had a nightmare.  

Kim rubs Kyle’s chest.

             KIMBERLY
    It’s okay now.  I’m right here.

An echo:

             MARLEY
	(V.O.)
    I’m right here.

Kyle grabs Kimberly’s hand, lifts it off his chest.

Sam intercepts, puts his hand over both of theirs.

             SAM
           (to Kyle)
    But that’s all it was.  Just a dream. 

HOSPITAL ROOM - NEXT MORNING

Lydia shaves Kyle’s face.  

             KYLE
    I can do this myself.

                                     59.

             LYDIA
    Almost done.

She wipes off traces of shaving cream.  Hands him a MIRROR.

             LYDIA
	(CONT’D)
    There.  Good as new.

Kyle stares at his 24-year-old face.  So young.

             KYLE
    I look like a kid.
           (beat)
    God, I am a kid.

HOSPITAL ROOM - THAT NIGHT

Kyle wakes to see Kimberly prepping a makeshift BED across two 
chairs.  She pulls a blanket from her duffle.

It’s covered in RED MONARCH BUTTERFLIES.

FLASHBACK - POND 

A red butterfly drops onto the water’s surface.  Drifts away.

FLASHBACK - FRONT YARD

Sarah chases a red butterfly toward the street.

END FLASHBACKS

             KYLE
    Let me see that.

             KIMBERLY
    Sorry, I wake you up?

             KYLE
    The blanket.

Confused, she hands it over.  He studies the butterflies.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    Did you sleep here while I was...

             KIMBERLY
    Yeah.  A few times.

             KYLE
    Did you say anything to me?

                                     60.

             KIMBERLY
    I asked you to wake up.  I’d tell you 
    not to--

             KYLE
    Let go.  You said that, didn’t you?  
    “Don’t let go.”

             KIMBERLY
    That’s right.

Kyle tries to process this. 

Kimberly misunderstands his silence.

             KIMBERLY
	(CONT’D)
    I’m sorry.  About the wreck.  Your 
    leg.  The way this all happened.
           (beat)
    What I said, in the car...

             KYLE
    I almost got you killed, Kim.

             KIMBERLY
    I distracted you.

             KYLE
    Don’t.


Kyle gives her the blanket.  Closes his eyes.

             KIMBERLY
    Tired?


Awkward silence.

             KIMBERLY
	(CONT’D)
    You asking me to leave?

Kyle doesn’t answer.

             KIMBERLY
	(CONT’D)
    Okay, then.  I’ll see you tomorrow.  

She leaves.  He presses the call button.  A moment, then:

             NURSE
    Are you all right?

             KYLE
    My leg’s killing me.  Can I get more 
    morphine?

                                     61.

A FEW MINUTES LATER

Benefield strolls in.  Checks his I.V. line.

             DR. BENEFIELD 
    You want more dope?  Forget it.

             KYLE
    Do you live here?

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Sure seems that way.  Here, best I 
    can do.

Hands him a tiny PILL CUP.  Kyle takes it.  Ponders...

             KYLE
    Do you believe in love?

She looks at him.  He looks right back at her.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    I’m a scientist.  I require proof, 
    with my own eyes, before I believe in 
    anything.  That said, I’ve seen the 
    way your mother loves you.  Your 
    girlfriend and your friend Sam.  They 
    love you.  Is that what you mean?

             KYLE
    No.  But I have my answer.  Thanks.

BEEP.  Benefield presses “STOP” on the bedside INFUSION PUMP.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    What’s that? 

             DR. BENEFIELD 
    Your morphine.  Talk or suffer.  
    Who’s Marley?  Ex-girlfriend?

He studies her.  She’s sincere. 

             KYLE
    Do people in comas... dream?

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Tell me why you’re asking, I’ll tell 
    you what I know.

             KYLE
    You’re tough.  Okay.  I have... 
    another life.  A wife.  Marley.  

                                     62.

             KYL E
	(CONT'D)
    Two daughters.  I have to get back 
    there.  They need me.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    I don’t understand.  When was this?

             KYLE
    Yesterday.  

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Yesterday you were here.  And the day 
    before that, and the day before that.

             KYLE
    But you were there, too.  You were my 
    doctor.

             DR. BENEFIELD
           (beat)
    Maybe you heard me talking.  In 
    comas, some people are still aware--

             KYLE
    But I saw you there.  We had 
    conversations.  

             DR. BENEFIELD
    You opened your eyes a lot.  Looked 
    right at me.  Maybe these dreams you 
    had, you incorporated me, and other 
    people, into them.  People you saw.

             KYLE
    What about Marley?  My kids. 

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Let me ask you something.  That 
    family with Marley, the kids, was it 
    the perfect version of your life?

Kyle doesn’t answer.  He doesn’t need to.

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(CONT’D)
    Kyle, your family’s here.  In this 
    room every day, waiting and praying 
    for you to heal.  Perfect or not, 
    they love you.  And they need you.  
    More than you need your dreams.

Benefield releases the closure on the IV, walks to the door.

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(CONT’D)
    Hey.  You’re going to be all right.

                                     63.

LATER

Kyle drifts off...

CUT TO: KYLE AND MARLEY’S HOUSE

Kyle looks around his living room.

There’s his furniture.  The BOOKCASE with Marley’s books. 

He picks The Incredible Misadventures of Ally the Brat. Runs 
his fingers across the cover.

Suddenly, he realizes where he is.  He races into the kitchen.

Yes!  It’s all still here.

Up the stairs.  His legs churn.  No cast.  No injury.

             KYLE
    Marley!  Girls!

He bursts through the bedroom door...

INT. KYLE’S HOSPITAL ROOM

Kyle wakes.  Looks around the hospital room.

He runs his hands over his chest, as if he’s lost something.

             KYLE
    No, damn it.

INT. KYLE’S HOSPITAL ROOM - NEXT DAY

Kimberly stands over Kyle’s bed, duffle clutched in her fist.   
They’re fighting.

             KYLE
    I can’t do it again, Kim.

             KIMBERLY
    If you’d tell me what’s going on with 
    you maybe I could help.

             KYLE
    You can’t.

             KIMBERLY
    You don’t know that.

Kyle watches her, comes to a realization.  And very 
inappropriately, he laughs.

                                     64.

             KIMBERLY
	(CONT’D)
    What’s funny about this?  

             KYLE
    Don’t you see?  We’re so young.  This 
    fight, this scene, it’s ridiculous.  
    Can’t we just be honest for once?

             KIMBERLY
    Honest about what?

             KYLE
    Why were you breaking up with me?  
    Breaking up with me again, I mean.  
    Come on, Kim.  Lay it on me.

Kimberly stares.  Then she turns on her heel... and is gone.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    Ah, shit.


HOSPITAL THERAPY ROOM

Kyle forces each step.  He white-knuckles the support bars.

He starts to fall.  The physical therapist, HENRY, grabs him.

             HENRY
    You’re almost there.  A few more.

Benefield walks in.

             KYLE
    Just in time for the show, Doc.

             HENRY
    He’s doing fine.

Kyle’s knees give out.  He hits the floor.

             KYLE
    Damn it.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    That’s enough for today.

MINUTES LATER

Benefield wheels Kyle down the hall.

             KYLE
    When’s the last time you pushed a 
    wheelchair?  Don’t you have, like, 
    people to do this?

                                     65.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Ha ha.  I wanted to talk to you.

KYLE’S HOSPITAL ROOM

Benefield helps Kyle out of the wheelchair.  An iPad lies on 
the bed - Benefield picks it up as Kyle climbs into bed.

The iPad opens to a PHOTO of Kyle, Kimberly, and Sam.  Kim’s 
in a cheerleading uniform, Kyle and Sam in football gear.

She swipes the touchscreen.  Another PIC of Kyle with friends.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Looking through old memories?

             KYLE
    Looking for Marley.

Oh. Benefield puts the iPad on the nightstand.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    I thought maybe I’d seen her 
    somewhere.  Hard to believe I just 
    made her up.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    That’s what I wanted to talk to you 
    about.  I’ve been doing some reading.  
    About coma cases and dreams.

Kyle looks up, hopeful.

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(CONT’D)
    Seems it’s pretty common.  People 
    wake up with memories that never 
    happened.  Because they dreamed them.

Kyle deflates.

             KYLE
    It’s true, then.  They’re gone. 

             DR. BENEFIELD
    They’re not gone, Kyle.  They were 
    never here.  

LATER THAT EVENING

Kyle looks through more photos.  Studies them.  Finds nothing.  
Tosses the iPad onto the chair.

             KYLE
    Just a dream.  A fucking dream.

                                     66.

He looks up: Kimberly’s at the door.

Kyle tries, but can’t contain it: he starts to sob.

             KIMBERLY
    Kyle.


She goes to him.  He reaches out, grabs her hand. 

She sits on the bed, wraps her arms around him.

MORNING

Kyle stirs.  Burrows closer to the warm body in his bed.

Fingers brush across his forehead.  His eyes slowly open.

             KIMBERLY
	(O.S.)
    You’re awake.

Kimberly keeps stroking his hair.  He squeezes his eyes shut.

             KYLE
    Yeah.  I’m awake.

Suddenly, Kimberly freezes.  She’s staring at the door.

Sam’s there.

             SAM
    Right.  Okay.  Good.

But it’s not good.  Sam leaves. 

             KYLE
    You want to go after him?

             KIMBERLY
           (beat)
    No.

MID AFTERNOON

Kyle ignores the lunch in front of him.

             LYDIA
    Spit it out.  What’s wrong?  

             KYLE
    Do you think I’m the type to settle?

             LYDIA
    Kim said she stayed here last night.

                                     67.

Kyle nods.

             LYDIA
	(CONT’D)
    If settling means you’ll be happier, 
    why not? 

           (beat)
    Not the answer you wanted?

             KYLE
    I don’t know anymore.

LATER THAT NIGHT

Kyle sleeps.  Eyelids twitch.

CUT TO: KYLE AND MARLEY’S BEDROOM

Kyle’s in the bed.  He opens his eyes.

Marley’s by the window.  She’s been crying.  

He gets up, reaches for her.  She stops him.

             MARLEY
    If you love her, why are you here?

He takes her in his arms.  She pushes him away, hard.

             MARLEY
	(CONT’D)
    Go back to her, then.  Just go.

KYLE’S HOSPITAL ROOM

Kyle wakes in a sweat.

HOSPITAL THERAPY ROOM - NEXT DAY

Sam watches Kyle work through his steps.  

             SAM
    Man, I wish I could do that for you.

Kyle comes to a shaky stop.   

             KYLE
    I know you would.  Do it for me.

Henry helps Kyle to a chair.  Leaves them alone.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    I’ve been a shitty friend to you.

             SAM
    No--


                                     68.

             KYLE
    You were right.  She’s broken up with 
    me seven times since the ninth grade.  
    Now I think I understand why.

             SAM
    Wait.  What are you saying?

KYLE’S HOSPITAL ROOM - THAT NIGHT

Kyle leans against the window frame, looking out. 

             KYLE
    Dream tonight.

He hobbles to the bed.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    Dream of Marley.  Dream.

EXT. POND

Kyle reels, then realizes where he is.  Marley’s beside him.

She starts to speak - he stops her.

             KYLE
    I love you.  I didn’t know how much 
    until I thought I’d lost you.

             MARLEY
    I’ve always been right here.

And like an whispered echo, he hears it again:

             VOICE
	(V.O.)
    ...been right here.

Kyle looks around for the source.  He and Marley are alone.  
But, by the lake: a SHADOW sits.  A silhouette.  What?

             KYLE
    Marley.  You’re not real.

             MARLEY
    I’m as real as she is.  Feel this?

She traces his lips.

             MARLEY
	(CONT’D)
    What about this?

Marley kisses him.  His eyes close.  He pulls back.

                                     69.

             KYLE
    Everyone, they’re telling me--

             MARLEY
    Don’t listen to them, Kyle.

CUT TO: HOSPITAL ROOM

             MARLEY
	(V.O.)
    Listen to me.

Kyle jerks awake.  Looks around.  No one.

His head falls against the pillow.  Defeated.  

He rubs his hands over his face.  Sucks in a deep breath...

Wait. There’s something.  A scent.  

He breathes in again.  Nothing. 

Straightens his blanket and catches the smell again.

The blanket.  He pulls it to his nose.  That smell.  It could 
only be one thing.  Somehow.  Some way.

She was here.

             KYLE
    Marley.


EXT. HOSPITAL COURTYARD - NEXT DAY

Sam pushes Kyle down a cement path.  

             SAM
    Now you’re just making shit up.

             KYLE
    She’s real.  I don’t care if no one 
    believes me.

             SAM
    Well, that’s something you can count 
    on.  No one’s going to believe you.

INT. KYLE’S HOSPITAL ROOM

Benefield reads Kyle’s chart.  Kyle talks rapid-fire.

             KYLE
    And my blanket, it smelled like her.

Benefield reaches for the MORPHINE PUMP.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    I’m going to lower this dosage.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER THAT DAY

Kyle cringes as Kimberly fumes.

                                     70.

             KIMBERLY
    Another girl.  From your coma.  How 
    stupid do I look?  You push me away 
    and when you finally decide to tell 
    me why... it’s because of a dream!?  

             KYLE
    I wanted you to know that it has 
    nothing to do with you.  

             KIMBERLY
    It has everything to do with me.  I’m 
    not your dream girl. Got it.

             KYLE
    I know it sounds crazy--

             KIMBERLY
    Sounds crazy?  That broken leg is the 
    least of your problems.

             KYLE
    Kim, stop.  Why are you so angry?  
    You don’t even love me.

That stops her cold.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    That’s okay, I don’t love you either.

             KIMBERLY
    Goodbye, Kyle.  Have a nice imaginary 
    life.  With your coma girl. 

She storms out.  Sam peeks in from outside the door.

             SAM
    Ouch.

             KYLE
    How much did you hear?

             SAM
    Sorry.

             KYLE
    Think we could smuggle in some beer?

                                     71.

             SAM
    And have Doc break your other leg?  
           (beat)
    You think she’ll be okay?  Kim?

             KYLE
    Yeah.  But maybe you should call her.

Sam doesn’t want to betray his friend...  

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    We’ve talked about this.  Call.  Her.

INT. THERAPY ROOM - NEXT DAY

Kyle struggles through therapy.  Benefield and Henry watch.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Unclog your damned ears for a minute, 
    all I’m saying is--

             KYLE
    I heard what you said about science, 
    seeing things with your own eyes.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    It’s not only that, Kyle.  You’re 
    choosing to believe something so... 

Kyle stumbles.  Henry moves to him, braces his legs.

             HENRY
    Five more, you’re done.

Kyle’s leg trembles.  He takes the step.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    I just don’t want you to expect--

             KYLE
    Not listening. 

His leg starts to buckle.  He tries to hold on.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    Can’t.  I can’t do anymore.

Benefield steps in front of him.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Come on.  You’re tougher than this.

But he crumples.  Benefield helps him to the floor.  Kyle 
turns from her, his face empty.  Beaten.

                                     72.

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(CONT’D)
    Henry, bring us some water, please.
           (to Kyle)
    Hey.  Hey, look here.

Kyle clenches his jaw, keeps his head turned away.

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(CONT’D)
    Kyle.  What’s going on?  

             KYLE
    My wife.  My kids.  I miss them. 

Benefield takes a beat.  Makes a decision.  Shit.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Fine.  You’ve convinced me.

             KYLE
    Yeah right.


             DR. BENEFIELD 
    I believe you.  Against everything I 
    know to be true, I believe you.  

             KYLE
    Stop.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    I’ll prove it.  I’ll do whatever I 
    can to help you find her.  But only 
    if you help yourself.  Five more.

Kyle takes a beat.  Then he hefts himself up.  Resolved.

Benefield backs away.

Henry’s at the door with the water.  She gestures him over.  
Kyle works through his steps, dogged.

             HENRY
           (whispers to Benefield)
    You don’t really believe him?

             DR. BENEFIELD
    No.  But I need him to believe it.

Kyle looks to them, a grin on his sweaty face.

INT. KYLE’S HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER

Kyle has the iPad on his lap, Internet White Pages on the 
screen.  Benefield stands beside the bed.

                                     73.

He jots one more name to a LIST he’s making.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Never been on a wild goose chase.  

             KYLE
    Deal’s a deal.

He gives her the list.  She tucks it into her pocket, gestures 
to a wheelchair.

THERAPY ROOM

Step after step, Kyle makes his way across the room.  Still on 
the support bars.  Real close to giving up.  

Benefield watches from the doorway. 

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Where did we leave off?  The duck 
    pond, wasn’t it?

             KYLE
           (exhausted)
    Her very favorite place.  Said she 
    always felt happy there.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Tell me more.

             KYLE
    The birds.  She loved those birds.

His spine straightens, he moves more determinedly.  

Benefield sees it.

INT. KYLE’S HOSPITAL ROOM - A FEW DAYS LATER

Benefield gives Kyle back his LIST - dozens of names crossed 
out.  Each name is PHELPS, from Amelia to Luther.

Written in the margin: “wrong number,” “disconnected,” “wrong 
number,” “no kids.”

             KYLE
    You called all of them?

             DR. BENEFIELD 
    It was a thrilling Saturday night.  
    What about you?

Kyle shows her his list, M through Z.  No luck.

                                     74.

KYLE’S HOSPITAL ROOM - NEXT DAY

iPad in front of him, Kyle searches the ‘Net.  Nothing. 

He sighs, puts down the iPad. 

KYLE’S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Kyle teeters beside his bed.  Alone.  Releases the bed rails.  

Stands for a moment.  His right leg crumples.

             KYLE
    Ow.  Shit.


LATER

A nurse checks Kyle’s morphine drip.  His shoulders drop.

It’s no damn use.

INT. KYLE’S HOSPITAL ROOM - NEXT MORNING

Benefield shines a light into one of Kyle’s eyes.

             DR. BENEFIELD 
    Don’t pull another stunt like that.

             KYLE
    Am I ever going to walk again?  Level 
    with me.

He’s discouraged.  She changes the subject.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    I keep thinking about Marley and that 
    flower made of pills.

             KYLE
    Yeah?  It was the weirdest thing.  I 
    was glad you were at the hospital 
    that day.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    I don’t know why.  I’m no 
    psychiatrist, and you certainly--

             KYLE
    --don’t want a neurosurgeon telling 
    you how to think.  

Benefield’s surprised.  Took the words right out of her mouth.  

                                     75.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    That’s what you said then, too.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - A FEW DAYS LATER

Kyle’s propped on crutches, Benefield next to him.

             DR. BENEFIELD 
    You sure you’re ready for this?

             KYLE
    She needs me.

             DR. BENEFIELD
           (beat)
    One time around the nurse’s desk.  
    That’s all.

Lydia rounds the corner, stops in her tracks.

             LYDIA
    You’re walking.

             DR. BENEFIELD 
    Three weeks before schedule.

             LYDIA
    That’s great, sweetheart.  

A hug.

             LYDIA
	(CONT’D)
    Excuse us for a minute, honey.  I 
    need to speak with Dr. Benefield.

             KYLE
    About what?


             LYDIA
    About getting the house ready for you 
    to come home.

Benefield brings over a nurse.

             DR. BENEFIELD 
           (to nurse)
    One time around.

The nurse leads Kyle away.

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(CONT’D)
    He’s been working very hard.

                                     76.

             LYDIA
    How dare you encourage these 
    fantasies of his?  He has a life 
    waiting for him outside this place, 
    or didn’t you remember that?

             DR. BENEFIELD
           (whoa)
    I’m doing what it takes to keep him 
    motivated.

             LYDIA
    Why don’t you take him on a trip to 
    Oz while you’re at it? 

             DR. BENEFIELD
    You want him better, don’t you?  He’s 
    walking weeks before he should.

             LYDIA
    Of course I want him better.  But I 
    don’t want him thinking he gets to 
    leave here and play house with some 
    imaginary wife.

Kyle shuffles up to them.

             KYLE
    You two look serious.

             LYDIA
    Just chatting.

Kyle doesn’t believe that for a second.

             DR. BENEFIELD
           (to Kyle)
    I’ll see you tomorrow.

She leaves.  Lydia helps her son to his room.

KYLE’S HOSPITAL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

             LYDIA
    Kim’s on her way over.

             KYLE
    Mom.  You have to stop meddling.

             LYDIA
    I know you two can work through this. 

Kyle makes his way to the bed, sits.

                                     77.

             KYLE
    You need to trust me to take care of 
    myself.  Kim, Sam, and I, we’re 
    adults.  We can handle a little 
    conflict.

She looks at him for a beat.

             LYDIA
    When did you get to be so grown-up?

Kimberly steps in.

             KYLE
    Hey.

             KIMBERLY
    Hey. 

             LYDIA
           (beat)
    Okay, then.

She leaves, Kim sits in the chair.  After an awkward silence:

             KIMBERLY
    I’ve been thinking about what you 
    said, really thinking about it.

             KYLE
    So have I.


             KIMBERLY
    I love you, I do, but...

She trails off.

             KYLE
    You don’t know how long I’ve waited 
    to hear this.  But what?

No answer.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    But... Sam.

             KIMBERLY
    What?


Kyle just gives her a knowing look.

             KIMBERLY
	(CONT’D)
           (beat)
    Nothing’s happened.

                                     78.

             KYLE
    Maybe something should.

             KIMBERLY
    Kyle, if this about that night--

             KYLE
    I’ve had a lot of time to think about 
    that night.  A lot of time, Kim.  I 
    was angry.  Selfish.  I should have 
    listened to you.  You were right. 
           (beat)
    Kim, you’re my best friend.  I love 
    you, too... but.

             KIMBERLY
           (starts to cry)
    That’s what we are, isn’t it?  We are
    best friends.
           (beat)
    I’m sorry.

             KYLE
    There’s nothing to be sorry for.

A nice silence.  Then:

             KIMBERLY
    You’re so different, after... I can’t 
    explain it.  But it’s nice.

             KYLE
    So.  You gonna call him?

             KIMBERLY
    I am not talking about Sam with you.  
    Not yet.  Besides, I’m ready to hear 
    about this angel of yours.

LATER

Kimberly takes it all in.

             KIMBERLY
    Wow.  That’s-- are you sure?

             KYLE
    Yeah.  I’m sure.

             KIMBERLY
    I’m just scared that you’ve--

                                     79.

             KYLE
    Gone mental?
           (beat)
    I know I’m right.  She’s out there.  
    I’m going to find her.

             KIMBERLY
    Well, I know better than to try and 
    talk you out of something you want.

Kimberly hugs him goodbye.

             KIMBERLY
	(CONT’D)
    Good night, Kyle.  Sweet dreams.

She leaves.  

Kyle squints, rubs his temples.  He buzzes the nurses station.

             KYLE
    Can I get some Tylenol, please?

LATER THAT NIGHT

Kyle sleeps.  Fitful.

FLASH

Whimpers.  Pitiful, heartbreaking sounds.  

Kyle follows the noises.  

Out his hospital room.  Down the hall.  

Through a door... into his daughters’ room.

GIRLS’ ROOM

Marley and her girls cower in a corner, cling to each other.

             MARLEY
    They’ll find me in a minute. 

Her hair hangs in limp strands.  Eyes sunken, hollow.

He hesitates, then gathers his family close.

             MARLEY
	(CONT’D)
    I can’t stay.  I want to but I don’t 
    know how.
           (beat)
    Please, don’t leave me here.

                                     80.

The girls have stopped crying.  They’ve stopped... moving.  He 
looks at them.  They’re dolls.  Ragged baby dolls.

What?  He looks around.  Behind him:

The hospital.  Benefield.  A nurse with a syringe.

Marley grips his arm.  He turns to her.  They’re back in the 
girls’ room.

             MARLEY
	(CONT’D)
    Don’t leave me.

             KYLE
    Where are you?

             MARLEY
    Kyle.

             KYLE
    Marley, where are you?

CUT TO: KYLE’S HOSPITAL ROOM

Kyle wakes.  My God.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

Kyle hobbles down the empty hall, on a mission.  Passes 
through some double doors.  A CHARGE NURSE rounds the corner.

             KYLE
    I need Dr. Benefield.  Can you find 
    her for me?

             CHARGE NURSE
    This is Critical Care.  You’re not 
    supposed to be in here.

At the far end of the hall, doors swing open.  Benefield with 
another DOCTOR.  He puts a hand on her shoulder.

             DOCTOR
    You tried, Tory.  You couldn’t have 
    done anything more than you did.

Benefield shrugs off his hand.  He leaves her alone.  

She stares at her SCRUB CAP, speckled with blood.

Kyle makes his way to her.

             KYLE
    I need your help.

She’s not happy to see him.

                                     81.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    It’s Marley.  She’s in trouble.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    I don’t want to hear another word 
    about Marley.  It’s time for you to 
    let this go.

             KYLE
    I knew it.  You lied.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    I just lost a patient.  I wish I 
    could dream that away, but I can’t.

She walks away, he struggles to follow.

             KYLE
    Wait!

             DR. BENEFIELD
    We can continue this discussion if 
    you can keep up with me.

He limps in earnest.  It gets harder and harder, but he goes 
all out - and collapses about ten steps in.

Benefield catches the arm of a passing INTERN.

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(CONT’D)
    Get him on a stretcher and back to 
    room four-seventeen.

She walks away.

HOSPITAL - WOMEN’S LOCKER ROOM - MINUTES LATER

Benefield’s now in street clothes.  She slams a LOCKER.  Picks 
up her bag, heads out.

KYLE’S HOSPITAL ROOM

The intern helps Kyle into bed.  He collapses onto his pillow.

A NURSE enters, re-attaches Kyle’s I.V. line.

             NURSE
    Always an adventure with you, Mr. 
    Lafferty.  Here, I’ll bump your 
    morphine a bit.  Help you sleep.

She adjusts the drip rate, leaves.

                                     82.

Kyle stairs at the ceiling.  Waitaminute.  He turns to the 
MORPHINE INFUSION PUMP.

He thinks, reaches over and presses the “STOP” button.  BEEP.

HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

Benefield walks down the hall, empty at this hour.

She pushes through some double-doors, takes a left.  Another 
left.  Stops at an elevator: OUT OF ORDER

             DR. BENEFIELD 
    Perfect.


She starts to head back.  Catches a glimpse of SOMEONE 
skirting around a corner.  She stops.  Takes a second look.

Nothing.

She starts walking again.

Waitasec. A WHISPER of sound.  She stops again, tries to 
hear.  There.  Faint.  Sing-songy.

KYLE’S HOSPITAL ROOM - SAME TIME

Kyle sleeps.  A SHADOW leans in.  FINGERS trace his lips.

HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

Benefield glances down at her watch.  2:36 AM.  

She hears the PLUNKS of someone walking on stairs.  

She opens a door.  The feet are heading down.  Toward her.

KYLE’S HOSPITAL ROOM

A dainty HAND lays a gentle palm against Kyle’s cheek.

STAIRWELL

The footsteps are close.  Benefield looks up...

It’s a JANITOR.  He goes past her, carrying a CLEAR TRASH BAG 
filled with STARGAZER LILIES.

Benefield can’t take her eyes off them.  

He goes through the stairwell door.  BAM - the door slams.

Silence.  Then, a far-off voice calls:

                                     83.

             FAR-OFF VOICE
	(O.S.)
    Marley.


Benefield strains to hear it.

             FAR-OFF VOICE
	(O.S.)
	(CONT’D)
    Come on, now.

Did she just hear... ? She waits, listens.  Nothing.

             DR. BENEFIELD 
    Okay, don’t be stupid.

She opens the stairwell door.  But it drifts to her again:

             FAR-OFF VOICE
	(O.S.)
    Marley.  


That IS what she heard. She bounds up the stairs.

KYLE’S HOSPITAL ROOM

The hand hovers just over Kyle’s chest, settles at his heart.

STAIRWELL

Benefield stops.  Listens.

             VOICE
	(O.S.)
    Marley!  


Definitely louder.  She grabs the door, it doesn’t budge.  A 
sign: FIFTH FLOOR - PSYCHIATRIC WARD

She touches her badge to a KEY-CARD READER.  BEEP.  She’s in.

KYLE’S HOSPITAL ROOM

Kyle’s in REM sleep.  Eyelids flutter.

CUT TO: KYLE AND MARLEY’S BEDROOM 

He stretches.  Rolls over.  Opens his eyes.  

Marley, mid 40’s, comes in from the bathroom in a YELLOW ROBE.

             MARLEY
    It’s quiet here with the girls gone.  

She slides onto the bed.  Curls up against him.  

             KYLE
    Please tell me this is real.

                                     84.

             MARLEY
    It’s real, all right.  Our little 
    birds have flown the coop. 

             KYLE
    Are we really here?

             MARLEY
    What?  Did you drink wine again?

             KYLE
    Marley.

             MARLEY
    Yes?

             KYLE
    Keep talking.

INT. HOSPITAL - NURSE’S STATION

Benefield reaches the station, hands her badge to the PSYCH 
WARD NURSE.

             DR. BENEFIELD 
    You’re going to think I’m nuts, but-- 

That gets her a stern look.

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(CONT’D)
    Sorry.  

           (beat)
    I overheard someone yelling.  

             PSYCH WARD NURSE 1 
    People in this ward do tend to yell, 
    Doctor.

Another nurse comes over with a WATERING CAN.

             PSYCH WARD NURSE 1
	(CONT’D)
           (to the nurse)
    Any sign of her?

             PSYCH WARD NURSE 2
           (re: watering can)
    I found this in the west stairwell.

INT. KYLE AND MARLEY’S BEDROOM

             MARLEY
    Sarah called.  She’s met some boy.  
    Wants to bring him to dinner.

                                     85.

             KYLE
    Hey, when’s the last time I told you 
    that I love you?

             MARLEY
    The last time you saw me.

INT. NURSE’S STATION

Benefield nods to the watering can.

             DR. BENEFIELD 
    Is that who you’re looking for?

             PSYCH WARD NURSE 2
    She's probably just snuck down to the 
    children’s unit to watch them sleep.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    You let her roam?

             PSYCH WARD NURSE 1
    She’s not dangerous.  She’s been here 
    practically her whole life.  Marley’s 
    a sweet girl.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Marley... Phelps?

             PSYCH WARD NURSE 1
    That’s right.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Marley Phelps is in this ward?

INT. KYLE AND MARLEY’S BEDROOM

Kyle strokes the hair from Marley’s face.  Studies her.

             MARLEY
    What are you doing?

             KYLE
    Memorizing your face.  I’m afraid 
    that I’m going to wake up and you 
    won’t be here.

             MARLEY
    No.  Talk about happy things.

INT. PSYCH WARD - MARLEY’S ROOM

Benefield steps through the door.

The walls are covered with HAND-DRAWN PICTURES.  Exquisite.

The artist is talented.  Faces captured in startling detail.

Every one of them is of Kyle and Marley.  Sometimes children 
are included - two girls.  Scenes from their life together. 

                                     86.

             PSYCH WARD NURSE 2
    We didn’t even know she could draw.  
    She just started working on those 
    about two months ago.  

             DR. BENEFIELD
           (beat)
    Eight weeks.

             PSYCH WARD NURSE 2
    Then three weeks ago she crashed.  We 
    don’t know what happened.

But for Benefield, the drawings tell the tale.  One of them is 
of Marley in the rocking chair with baby Elizabeth.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Remarkable.


Benefield goes to the small WRITING TABLE.  

On it, a JOURNAL lies open.  Neat handwriting fills each line.  
She looks up from the desk.

And that’s when she sees it, out the window:

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(CONT’D)
    The new neurosurgery wing.

             PSYCH WARD NURSE 2
    Once they broke ground we couldn't 
    tear her away from this window.  Now 
    she sits all day, watching people 
    come in and out of the rooms.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    And at night...

Benefield’s eyes scan the building across from them.  There:

Marley’s window looks directly down into Kyle’s room.

It’s dark, but a young woman is visible, sitting in Kyle’s 
bedside chair, head resting on his chest.

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(CONT’D)
    I think I found your girl.

EXT. DUCK POND

Kyle and Marley walk hand-in-hand beside the water.

                                     87.

             MARLEY
    You mean we’re just going to rattle 
    around that big house all alone?

             KYLE
    We’ll occupy ourselves somehow.

             MARLEY
    I’m happy to be alone with you.

             KYLE
    Me, too.  

             MARLEY
           (beat)
    Let’s get a dog.

Right then, a huge GREAT DANE bounds up to them.  WOOF!

INT. KYLE’S HOSPITAL ROOM

The MORPHINE INFUSION PUMP blinks “OFF.”

And Kyle opens his eyes.  

HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

Benefield, the Psych Ward Nurse, and two orderlies hurry 
toward Kyle’s room.

KYLE’S HOSPITAL ROOM

Marley hasn’t noticed that Kyle’s awake.

He stays still and listens to her speak.  

No longer a part of the story.

             MARLEY
           (whispers)
    A Great Dane.  I’ve always wanted a 
    big dog.  And he’s sweet, too.

She’s smaller than she was in the dream, more frail.  Lank 
hair.  Pale, almost translucent skin.

HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

Benefield and the staff round a corner.

                                     88.

             PSYCH WARD NURSE 2 
    I hope he doesn’t try to interact 
    with her.

             DR. BENEFIELD 
    Why?


             PSYCH WARD NURSE 2 
    She can’t take direct contact.  It’s 
    one of her triggers.

Benefield breaks into a run.

KYLE’S HOSPITAL ROOM

             MARLEY
           (whispers)
    Let’s name him Howard, okay?
           (excited)
    Oh.  We should play in the rain.  
    Make it rain, Kyle.
           (beat)
    Hello... Earth to Kyle...

CUT TO: DUCK POND

The Great Dane gallops up to Marley with a STICK in his mouth.

But Marley’s looking at Kyle, standing still next to her, like 
a frozen-in-time mannequin.

             MARLEY
    Why are you just standing there?

Then suddenly: he vanishes.

INT. KYLE’S HOSPITAL ROOM

A tear rolls down Kyle’s cheek.  Marley’s still whispering:

             MARLEY
    Where did you go?  You’re supposed to 
    make it rain and say...

             KYLE
    I love you.


She stiffens.  She’s frozen, like an animal trapped by its 
predator, just waiting for the attack.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    Marley?  Baby?  It’s me.

She pulls her head from his chest and creeps away from him.

                                     89.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    It’s me.  Kyle.

She trembles, her eyes are blank, staring off into a world he 
can no longer see.

Kyle sits up, and Marley darts out of the room...

HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

...right into the arms of the orderlies.  She struggles.  They 
immediately let her go.  

She scuttles to the end of the hallway, cowers in a corner.

Kyle stumbles to the doorway.

             KYLE
    Marley!


Then Benefield’s there, in front of him.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Don’t.


             KYLE
    What’s wrong with her?

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Wait.  Just wait.

The orderlies and the Psych Ward Nurse inch toward Marley.  

She whimpers.  They turn their eyes away, don’t look directly 
at her.  Marley grunts, tugs at her hair.  

The nurse approaches.  Slow, eyes down. 

             PSYCH WARD NURSE 2
    My goodness, Marley.  You’re a long 
    way from home.  Did you find some 
    thirsty plants over here?

Marley peeks at her.  Thinks about that.  Nods.

             PSYCH WARD NURSE 2
	(CONT’D)
    Did you give them all their water?

Another nod.

             PSYCH WARD NURSE 2
	(CONT’D)
    What a good girl.  
           (beat)
    I’m sleepy.  How about you?

                                     90.

Benefield watches, fascinated.  Kyle struggles to understand.

Eyes still turned away, the nurse holds out her hand.  Marley 
inches toward it.

She’s about to take the hand but pulls back a little.  

Then, she touches a finger to the nurse’s palm.  Does it 
again, as if testing to see if the fingers will capture her.  

The nurse holds her hand perfectly still.  Marley cautiously 
places her fingers against the palm.

The nurse’s fingers close, slowly, around Marley’s hand.

             PSYCH WARD NURSE 2
	(CONT’D)
    Bedtime.  Okay?

Nurse and Marley walk away, hand in hand.  Kyle can't tear his 
eyes away.  He remembers.

FLASHBACK - TRAUMA UNIT

The FLASH of overhead fluorescents.

At a care station, a DOCTOR with a crying CHILD...

More lights overhead.  FLASH.  FLASH.

An ELDERLY WOMAN getting oxygen...

FLASH.  FLASH.

A NURSE - the same Psych Ward Nurse - bandages a YOUNG WOMAN’s 
forehead.  The nurse moves aside and we see the patient’s 
face.  It’s Marley.

Her eyes lift, lock onto Kyle's...

END FLASHBACK

             KYLE
           (to Benefield)
    It’s her.

EXT. HOSPITAL COURTYARD - NEXT DAY

Kyle and Sam sit on a bench, some crutches next to Kyle.  He 
stares up at MARLEY’S WINDOW.

             SAM
    I should have believed you.  Kimberly 
    says Marley’s... sick.

                                     91.

             KYLE
    Doc says it’s a “broad spectrum de-
    personalization disorder.”  Soli-- 
    solipsism syndrome.

             SAM
    Oh yeah.  That.  Sure.

             KYLE
    For Marley, the world is in her head.  
    She believes everything she sees is 
    only in her imagination.  She lives 
    in her own story.

             SAM
    So, she was telling you a story.

             KYLE
           (turns to Sam)
    When I woke up last night and she was 
    there - she was waiting for me.

             SAM
    Waiting?


             KYLE
    Waiting for me to add to it.  That’s 
    what I’ve been doing all along.  It 
    wasn’t a story.  It was our story.

             SAM
    Dude.  That’s not possible.  You were 
    in a coma.

Kyle’s eyes go back to Marley’s window.

             KYLE
    I know I can reach her.  I’m the only 
    one who can.  

INT. PSYCH WARD - DAY

Benefield and Kyle, on crutches, head through the halls. 

             DR. BENEFIELD
    You’re absolutely not supposed to be 
    here, but I wanted you to see this.  
    She’s still in the rec room, so we 
    have maybe fifteen minutes.

             KYLE
    I need to see her.  I scared her the 
    last time - she didn’t know I was 
    going to wake up.

                                     92.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    She isn’t the Marley you loved, Kyle.

             KYLE
    But if I could just--

             DR. BENEFIELD
    I said no.  You promised you wouldn’t 
    do this if I brought you here.
           (beat)
    I’m going to show you her room.  In 
    and out.  Otherwise, we leave now.

             KYLE
    Okay.  I want to see it. 

INT. MARLEY’S ROOM

Kyle takes it all in.  He walks the perimeter of the room, 
fingers tracing Marley’s face in each drawing.

             KYLE
    It’s all here.  Every moment we spent 
    together.

             DR. BENEFIELD 
    She told you all these things.  It’s 
    no surprise you recognize them.

Kyle takes a look around.  Maybe the doc’s right.

He turns to leave...

...when one drawing catches his eye.

It’s of a DISCO BALL, hanging from a rearview mirror.

He unpins the paper from the wall.

             KYLE
    This.  This was the last thing I saw 
    before the crash.  I told her this.

Another drawing: a large oak, initials carved in the bark.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    My third grade crush.  I carved her 
    initials.  I told Marley about her.

And another - a shaggy pup, tongue wagging.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    Rufus.  My first dog.

                                     93.

He hands Benefield the disco ball drawing.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    Only one way she could have known to 
    draw these things.  We were together.

VOICES approach from outside the room.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Time to go.


PSYCH WARD

Kyle follows Benefield.

One of the orderlies from the previous night turns a corner, 
heads toward them.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Shit.


Benefield pushes Kyle back around the corner.

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(CONT’D)
    Don’t let him see you.

She steps back into the hall.

             ORDERLY
	(O.S.)
    Hey, Doc.  Come to see our Marley?

As Kyle waits, he sees a SIGN: an arrow points in the 
direction of the RECREATION ROOM.

Benefield and the orderly walk past.

Kyle waits another beat, then slips down the corridor.

OUTSIDE REC ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

He looks through the window and there she is.  

Marley.  Alone in a corner.  Holding TWO BABY DOLLS.

REC ROOM

Kyle makes his way to Marley.  He’s surprisingly fast, urgency 
pushing his bad leg forward.

The other PATIENTS ignore him, WARD NURSES chat in a corner.

Kyle kneels in front of Marley.  Takes her hand.

                                     94.

             KYLE
    Marley?  


He pulls from her mouth the hair she’s been chewing on.

PSYCH WARD

Benefield returns.  No Kyle.  Sees the rec room SIGN.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Damn it.  Damn it!

REC ROOM

Marley’s eyes swim into focus... and focus on Kyle.  

And for one moment they are together.  Eyes locked in love.

Marley’s hand lifts.  But then her eyes cloud over and she’s 
pulled back into herself.  She cowers.

Kyle reaches for her.

             KYLE
    Marley, don’t be afraid.  It’s me.

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(O.S.)
    Kyle, no!


He pulls Marley to him.  A tortured HOWL rips from her throat.  

Kyle reacts by hugging her tight.  But Marley’s howl only 
grows louder.  Pure torment.  She THRASHES in his arms.

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(CONT’D)
    Kyle, let her go.  Kyle!

Kyle relaxes his hold, Marley breaks free.  She runs to a 
wall... and BASHES her head against it.  Again.  Again.

Again.  BLOOD smears the plaster.  

             KYLE
    Marley!


Pandemonium.  Nurses race over.

Kyle tries to get to Marley, but rowdy PATIENTS block his way.  
They shout, throw books and chairs.

The nurses get through the crowd, try to restrain Marley.  She 
screams and claws, her head bleeding badly.

                                     95.

Finally her voice starts to give out.  Her eyes roll back.  
And she goes limp.

Two beefy ORDERLIES drag Kyle away.  

INT. OFFICE OF THE HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATOR - AN HOUR LATER

Benefield paces.

DR. PIERCE (60’s), enters.  Slams the door behind him.

             DR. PIERCE
    You have placed me and this hospital, 
    in an impossible position.  Thanks to 
    you, we now have seven patients who 
    had to be forcibly restrained, four 
    with broken bones, three who needed 
    sutures.  What were you thinking, 
    Tory?  This isn’t like you.  Tell me 
    what I’m supposed to do here.

A KNOCK on the door.

             NURSE
    Doctor, you wanted me to let you know-

             DR. PIERCE
    Thank you, Anna.  Tory, let’s go.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Where?

             DR. PIERCE
    To try and clean up some of this mess 
    you’ve made.

KYLE’S HOSPITAL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Pierce stops in the doorway, motions Benefield to enter.

Kyle’s in bed.  In RESTRAINTS.

             KYLE
    Doc, get me out of these.

Benefield’s barely in the room when she turns on Pierce.

             DR. BENEFIELD
           (fierce whisper)
    Restraints?  Is that necessary?

             DR. PIERCE
    They wouldn’t be needed if you had 
    properly controlled your patient.

                                     96.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    This is not--

             DR. PIERCE
    I’m in charge now.  The message to 
    that young man is this: you and I, 
    we’re on the same page.  You stand 
    with me, or you’re fired.

He steps past her, into the room.

             DR. PIERCE
	(CONT’D)
    Mr. Lafferty.  I am Dr. Weldon 
    Pierce, chief administrator of this 
    hospital.  Dr. Benefield is no longer 
    the physician in charge of your care.

             KYLE
    What?

             DR. PIERCE
    You and your doctor have been 
    involved in an incident that has left 
    another patient of this hospital in 
    critical condition.

             KYLE
    Marley.

           (to Benefield)
    How bad is it?

Benefield can’t look at him.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    How bad?


She shakes her head, stares at the floor.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    Marley’s... dying?
           (beat)
    How long?

             DR. PIERCE
    Few hours.  Maybe less.

Kyle FIGHTS against the restraints.

             KYLE
    Take me to her.  I’ve got to see her.

             DR. PIERCE
    There will be no more of that.  Dr. 
    Benefield, you’re done for the day.  

                                     97.

             DR. PIERCE
	(CONT'D)
    Go home.  Mr. Lafferty, you consider 
    getting yourself an attorney.

HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

             DR. BENEFIELD 
    What the hell was that?

             DR. PIERCE
    That was exactly what you would have 
    done eight weeks ago.  Walk away from 
    that boy and never look back.

He leaves her.  She’s still within earshot of Kyle.

             KYLE
	(O.S.)
    Please.  I promised her.  No more sad 
    stories.  I promised.

Benefield wavers.  Then steels herself and walks away.

WOMEN’S LOCKER ROOM - MINUTES LATER

Benefield sits on a bench.  Stares at the WALL CLOCK.

TICK.  TICK.  TICK.  TICK.

She pulls her eyes away, opens her locker.  Her hospital ID 
BADGE hangs inside, mocking her.  She reaches for her jacket.

Another look at the clock.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Do you believe in love...

Fuck it.  She grabs her badge.

KYLE’S HOSPITAL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Kyle’s still in restraints.  Tears track his cheeks.

The door opens.  He doesn’t bother to look up.

             KYLE
    What do you want?

             DR. BENEFIELD 
    We don’t have much time.

HALLWAY OUTSIDE PYSCH WARD - MOMENTS LATER

Two ORDERLIES block Kyle’s entrance into the ward.

Through the double-doors, Benefield ARGUES with a third 
ORDERLY and the Psych Ward Nurse.

It gets heated.  Benefield comes back through the doors.

                                     98.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Pierce put them on alert.

             KYLE
    I’m not leaving.  Not ‘til I see her.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    She’s non-responsive.  She won’t even 
    know you’re here, Kyle.  

             KYLE
    Why isn’t she in the ICU?

Benefield says nothing.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    You mean they’re not even going to 
    try to save her?  They’re just going 
    to let her die?

             DR. BENEFIELD
    That’s all they can do.  
           (beat)
    It’s her family’s wishes that she be 
    as comfortable as possible.

             KYLE
    Family?


Just then a WOMAN comes out of Marley’s room.  Older, still 
quite beautiful.  She has Marley’s hair, her eyes.    

This can only be: ELIZABETH PHELPS.  Marley’s mother.

The nurse says something to her, points toward Kyle.

Elizabeth’s eyes meet Kyle’s.  She pushes through the doors...

...and SLAPS Kyle hard.

             ELIZABETH
    You.  It was you.

Another SLAP.  Kyle takes it.  Elizabeth pulls at his shirt.

             ELIZABETH
	(CONT’D)
    Why?  You son of a bitch.  Why did 
    you have to touch her?

                                     99.

             KYLE
    Marley’s the world to me.

             ELIZABETH
    Don’t you say her name.  

             KYLE
    Please, just wait.  Let me explain--

             ELIZABETH
    How you killed my daughter?  How you 
    took from me the only thing left that 
    I care about?

             KYLE
    Marley’s the only thing I care about.  
    She’s my wife.

Elizabeth backs away, turns to the orderlies.

             ELIZABETH
    This man is crazy.  Keep him far away 
    from this room.  
           (to Kyle)
    You stay away from my daughter. 

She stalks away.

             KYLE
    I know what happened to Laura.

This stops her cold.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    I know everything.  Marley told me.

             ELIZABETH
    You’re lying.  Marley never speaks.

She opens the hallway door, but...

             KYLE
    When Marley was nine, her hermit crab 
    fell into the heating vent.  She 
    cried for weeks.

Elizabeth freezes.  How?

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    When Laura’s baby teeth fell out 
    before Marley’s, Marley pulled out 
    her own front teeth.  That’s the 
    first time you took her to a 
    psychiatrist.  

                                     100.

Oh, my God. She turns to him.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    I know that you sang Twinkle Twinkle 
    Little Star to them every night.  You 
    sang all the verses.  Marley’s the 
    only person I’ve ever known who can 
    sing every word of that song.  
    Because you taught it to her.

             ELIZABETH
    Marley doesn’t talk.  To anyone.

             KYLE
    She talks to me.

He looks to Benefield.  She nods.  Go on.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    Elsewhere, in another time or place 
    or... existence, Marley is my wife.  
    I need to be with her.  I can’t let 
    her do this alone.  Please.

MARLEY’S ROOM

Kyle moves to the bed.  Marley’s on her back, head bandaged.

He forces his bad leg to bend, sits beside her.

Elizabeth, Benefield, the Psych Ward Nurse and the Orderly are 
all there.   

             KYLE
           (to Benefield)
    Will I hurt her?

             DR. BENEFIELD 
    No.  You won’t hurt her.

Kyle slides his arms beneath Marley and carefully pulls her up 
against his chest.

His eyes track the room, the drawings.  Their life together.

He closes his eyes.  Leans down to Marley.

             KYLE
    Marley?  I’m here.

A beat.  Nothing.  Tries again.

                                     101.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    I don’t know how to do this.  Come on 
    baby, help me.

Another long beat.  Then, suddenly, the world tilts...

CUT TO: KYLE AND MARLEY’S HOUSE

Kyle opens his eyes.  Yes!

The house is empty, no furniture, nothing.  Except some PAGES 
scattered around the living room.

             KYLE
    Marley!


Kyle runs into the kitchen... up the stairs... the bathroom... 
the bedrooms...

Nothing.  No one.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    Marley!


CUT TO: MARLEY’S ROOM

Kyle’s back in the hospital.  Frustrated.

             KYLE
    I can’t find her.  I don’t know how.

He looks to Benefield.  She’s sympathetic but has no answers. 

His eyes go back to the drawings.

And that’s when he sees it, stuck down in a corner of the 
wall, nearly hidden by the others.

Scribbled blackness, covering an illustration.

Oh no. He turns back to Marley.  His eyes close, focuses...

CUT TO: KYLE AND MARLEY’S HOUSE

He’s back in the empty house.

Those papers on the living room floor.  Kyle grabs one, turns 
it over.  It’s scribbled black.  Flips another: all black.

FLASHBACK - GIRL’S ROOM

Elizabeth reads from a book, flips past a black page.

                                     102.

             KYLE
    Wait.  That page.  Turn back.

She does.  It’s an illustration of the duck pond.

END FLASHBACK

Kyle looks at the blacked-out paper in his hand.

             KYLE
    That’s where you are.

He rushes to the door.  Opens it.

Inky BLACKNESS grips the house.  No light, no sound.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    Marley?


EXT. HOUSE

Kyle steps onto the dark lawn.  A chill WIND picks up.

             KYLE
    Light.  Give me light.

Nothing.  He takes a step, blindly feels his way.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    Give me light, damn it!

Kyle’s got his arms out, searching.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    How did you do this, Marley?

It hits him.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
           (to himself)
    The story.  Tell the story.
           (out loud)
    He... sees a light?

In the distance: a LIGHT.  Yes! But it’s too far, too faint.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    The light becomes brighter.  

The glow shimmers, expands... 

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    It leads him... to her.

                                     103.

From the light, a warm burst rushes along the ground, toward 
him, making a luminous PATH that stops at his feet.

He takes a step onto the glowing trail.  Then runs.

EXT. POND - LATER

The path’s taken Kyle to the park.  He jogs around the pond.  
Stops.  Catches his breath.  Darkness is pushing in.

             KYLE
    Marley.  Where are you?

He closes his eyes.  Concentrates.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    He sees her.  She’s sitting alone, by 
    the edge of the water.
           (beat)
    Please, God...

Kyle opens his eyes.

And there she is.  Standing in front of him. 

             MARLEY
    I was tired of sitting.

He laughs, grabs her, twirls.

             MARLEY
	(CONT’D)
    I knew you’d find me.

She runs loving hands across his face.  He squeezes her tight.

             KYLE
    Let’s get you out of here.

She doesn’t move.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    Come on.

             MARLEY
    I can’t.

             KYLE
    It’s easy.  Follow me.  

She shakes her head.  No.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    Your... your mother’s there.

                                     104.

             MARLEY
    Mom?

             KYLE
    She wants to see you.  So badly.

             MARLEY
    Please tell her something.  Tell her 
    it wasn’t her fault.  Please. 

             KYLE
    Tell her yourself.

             MARLEY
    Kyle.  I have to stay.

             KYLE
    That's not true.  Come with me.

             MARLEY
    It was the life I always dreamed of.  
    Thank you.

             KYLE
    No.  No, Marley.  Stop.

He wants to fight it.  But he knows she's right.

He looks around the pond, at the blackness closing in.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    Why here?  Why this darkness? 

             MARLEY
    After Laura died, this is where I 
    went.  It’s where I’ve been ever 
    since.  Except, when I was with you.

And that’s when Kyle understands.  Resolve hardens his face.

             KYLE
    No.  Not like this.  I’m not letting 
    you stay here.

             MARLEY
    It’s where I belong--

He pulls her to him.  Kisses her.  It’s THE kiss.  Full of 
sureness, fire.

She gives herself to him.

Then his lips drift to her ear:

                                     105.

             KYLE
    Listen to me.
           (beat)
    This is the kind of party you 
    deserve.  So many people love you.  
    Happy Birthday, Marley.

CUT TO: THE DUCK POND

A BIG BAND plays DIXIELAND JAZZ while party-goers whoop it up. 

Kyle and Marley, late 70’s now, hold each-other in a slow 
dance - defying the upbeat music.

Marley looks around at the park, now filled with lights and 
joy.  But then she sees Kyle’s creased face.  Her aged hand.

             MARLEY
    We’re so wrinkly.

             KYLE
    It’s our story.  And this - this is 
    our happy ending.
           (beat)
    You see that over there?

Marley looks over.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    Your damn ducks, begging for food.

A little girl, the spitting image of Sarah at 5, runs up.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    Look who’s here to tug on your skirt.

             MARLEY
    Casey-Belle.  You want to dance?

Kyle hoists the girl into Marley’s arms.  The three of them 
dance as the sun sinks closer to the horizon.

Their daughters, Elizabeth and Sarah, both now middle-aged, 
gather their families closer to Kyle and Marley.  

A woman in her 20’s, looking like Marley did at that age, 
takes Casey from Marley and Kyle’s arms.  

She leans in to touch her cheek to Marley’s.  

             YOUNG WOMAN
    Happy Birthday, Granny.

                                     106.

Parents, children, grandchildren and great grandchildren all 
pile onto the dance floor.

             KYLE
    Do you know how very much I love you?

             MARLEY
    More and more every day.  

He presses old but tender lips to her creased eyelids.

She opens her eyes.  Over his shoulder, Marley sees something.

Something... wonderful.

Kyle follows her eyes, turns.  He tries to see through the 
crowd.  Dancers step to the right, whirl to the left.

             KYLE
    What is it?

             MARLEY
    I see her.

             KYLE
    Who?

             MARLEY
    I see Laura.

             KYLE
    Laura?


He searches the crowd...

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    I don't see her.
           (realizes)
    That means--

Kyle breaks.  Tears slide down his face.

Her eyes go back to him.  Sad.  Happy.

             MARLEY
    She’s waiting for me.

One more sweet kiss.  And Kyle feels the world slipping away.

             MARLEY
	(CONT’D)
    My prince.


             KYLE
    Marley.  Please don’t go.

                                     107.

A SOUND calls to him.  It’s a faint BEEP.

             MARLEY
	(V.O.)
    I love you.


INT. MARLEY’S ROOM - HOSPITAL

The BEEP of Marley’s heart monitor.  Slowing.

Kyle kisses Marley’s closed eyes.  Her breathing’s shallow.

             ELIZABETH
    I was never able to hold her like 
    that.  She hasn’t let me touch her 
    since Laura died.

             KYLE
    Come here.


             ELIZABETH
    She hates me.  

             KYLE
    No.  Never.


Elizabeth wants to believe it.  But can’t.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    Marley loves you.  She always has.
           (beat)
    She named our first daughter for you.  

Her eyes go to her Marley.  Yearning.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    Come here.


Elizabeth takes Kyle’s place on the bed.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    She wanted me to tell you something.

Kyle puts Marley into the arms of her mother.

             KYLE
	(CONT’D)
    She said, it wasn’t your fault.

The words take Elizabeth’s breath away.

             ELIZABETH
    My sweet, sweet girl.  Forgive me.

She cradles her daughter close, rocks her.

                                     108.

Kyle watches them.  Then sees a vase of STARGAZER LILIES.

             ELIZABETH
	(CONT’D)
    I brought them to her every week.  
    She was fascinated by the color.

             KYLE
    She saw them.  They’re her favorites.

He looks at Marley, lying still in Elizabeth’s arms.  He 
shifts weight off his bad leg, stands awkwardly.

             ELIZABETH
    It’s okay.  Sit with us.

He sits, cradles Marley’s fingers.  Elizabeth lays her hand 
over their joined hands.

             ELIZABETH
	(CONT’D)
    Thank you.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Kyle?



She holds out a SMALL BOOK.

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(CONT’D)
    This was on the desk.  

It’s Marley’s journal.  On the cover: a drawing of a YELLOW 
KITE, pulled by the wind.

Kyle opens it.  Reads.  Then, just a glimmer of a smile.  

             KYLE
    Did you know Marley wrote children’s 
    books?

             ELIZABETH
    I... I don’t know much about her.
           (beat)
    Will you tell me about my daughter?

             KYLE
    I’ll tell you everything.

EXT. PARK - SOME MONTHS LATER

A bright yellow kite lies on the grass.  A strong breeze 
catches it, the toy skitters across the ground...

...lifts into the air and is pulled taut.  

Kyle tightens his grip, the kite hovers above the trees.  

                                     109.

It TUGS forcefully.  

He rolls out more string, lets it fly higher.  

Satisfied for only a moment, the kite TUGS again. 

Kyle laughs.  Then, a sigh.  Bittersweet.

His grip loosens, the kite pulls.  

Fingers open, the string slips through his hand.  

He... lets go.

The kite’s nylon ripples, as if dancing.  It sways from side 
to side.  Teasing him.  Playing with him.

Then the wind catches it.  The kite flies away, just a tiny 
yellow dot in a big blue sky.

Kyle watches its journey.

             KYLE
    Go, baby.  Go.

And just like that - it’s gone.

Free.

             THE END

                                 FADE OUT.
