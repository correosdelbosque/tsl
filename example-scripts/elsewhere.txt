FADE IN:
EXT. CAR, HIGHWAY - NIGHT

A downpour.  Windshield wipers thwack against the rain.

INT. CAR

KYLE LAFFERTY (20s) drives, angrily wipes condensation from 
the glass.  

KIMBERLY BROOKS (20s) sits shotgun.  Sulks. 

Kyle and Kimberly.  High School Sweethearts.  

             KYLE
    Me, smiling like a fool.  Its fine, 
    hon, well talk in the car.  This is 
    not fine.  Im not fine.

LIGHTNING rips at the night.  A DISCO BALL ORNAMENT hangs from 
the rearview, scatters the light.

             KIMBERLY
    I just need more time.  So do you.  
    You just wont--
           (looks at road)
    Kyle.  Slow down.

A TRACTOR TRAILER rumbles past.  

SPLASH.  The windshields doused.  Wipers flail.

             KYLE
    Everyone was there tonight.  We 
    shouldve told them.  Thanks for 
    coming.  Oh and Kim needs more time.

Ahead, a CAR slams its brakes.  Kyle swerves.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    Damn it.


He scrubs off some speed.  Twists the defrost to HIGH.  Wipes 
again at the foggy glass.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    Sorry.  I was out of line.

Kyle reaches over, puts a hand on hers.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    Youre scared.  I get it.


                                      2.
She pulls her hand away.

             KIMBERLY
    No.  No, you dont.

He takes his eyes off the road, turns to her.

             KYLE
    What are you saying?

             KIMBERLY
    I love you, Kyle.  I do, but--

Oncoming HEADLIGHTS illuminate Kimberlys face.

The disco ball catches the light - throws it around the car.

BLINDING LIGHT.

INT. HOSPITAL - LATER

Trauma Unit.  STAFF scramble, prep for--

Doors burst open.  Paramedics pull in GURNEYS.  

DR. TORY BENEFIELD (50s) meets them.  Shes commanding, calm.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    What do we have?

             PARAMEDIC
    Severe head trauma, depressed cranial 
    fracture.  Glad youre here tonight, 
    Doc.

The gurneys are lined up.  Nurses hang bags, cut clothing.

Benefield moves to Kyles stretcher.  He struggles to breathe.

             PARAMEDIC
	(CONTD)
    Names Kyle.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Kyle.  Youre going to be fine.  

             PARAMEDIC
    BPs seventy over forty-five.  Status 
    post four liters normal saline.

Not good.  Benefield stays cool.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Nora-epi, four mgs stat.


                                      3.
An angry red SEATBELT BURN cuts across Kyles chest.  
Benefield feels for other injuries.  Quick.  Efficient.

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(CONTD)
    Kyle?  Can you hear me?

But Kyles not looking at her.  His eyes are focused on the 
gurney to his right.  Kimberly.  Unconscious, bloody.  

Doctors work frantically on her body, block Kyles view.

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(O.S.)
	(CONTD)
    You stay with me, Kyle. 

His eyes slide shut.

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(O.S.)
	(CONTD)
    O.R. three.


Kyle forces his eyes open, tries to hold them on Kimberly as 
hes wheeled away...

The FLASH of overhead fluorescents.

FLASH.

At one care station, theres a DOCTOR with a crying CHILD...

More lights overhead.  FLASH.  FLASH.

An ELDERLY WOMAN getting oxygen...

FLASH.  FLASH.

A NURSE bandaging a YOUNG WOMANs forehead...

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(O.S.)
	(CONTD)
    Let's move it.

FLASH FLASH FLASHFLASHFLASH...

INT. BEDROOM - DAY

Plain room.  Shadows blacken corners, only the BED sees light.

Kyles on his back.  Stares a hole through the ceiling.

The sun comes up, goes down, comes up. 

He blinks.  Once.

Another revolution of the sun.  Light... dark... light.

All while he lies, motionless.  Staring.


                                      4.
EXT. CEMETERY - TWO DAYS LATER

More rain.  Wind, thunder.

Kyle leans on a CRUTCH, against a black Cadillac.  The rain 
seems to target him.  Hes oblivious.

An UMBRELLA moves in, blocks the water. 

LYDIA LAFFERTY (50s), holds the umbrella over her sons head.

MOURNERS step up, offer condolences.

             LYDIA
    Wheres Sam?

Kyle nods toward the car.  AN ELDERLY MAN comes up to him.  

             ELDERLY MAN
    It was a beautiful service...

The sound trails off.  The mans lips form unheard words.  

Kyle looks around.  Rain slaps the car... trees sway in the 
wind... people shuffle over wet pavement, talking... 

But theres no sound.

Then the silence is broken by his mothers voice:

             LYDIA
    Ready, honey?

Sounds come flooding back to Kyle.  What the--

             LYDIA
	(CONTD)
    Is it your head?  Do we need to take 
    you back?  The doctors said--

             KYLE
    That I might be fuzzy for a while.  
    Thats all it was.  Lets go. 

She opens the car door, he slides into the back seat.

INT. CADILLAC

SAM ANDERSON (20s), rough-cut hammer-head with a Mack Truck 
build, is slumped in the seat.  

He sits up, pretends he wasnt crying.  Kyle lets him play it 
off, pulls the door shut.


                                      5.
LAUNDRY ROOM - LATER THAT DAY

Kyle pulls a load of LAUNDRY - whites - from the dryer.  
Theyre all tinted PINK.  

He digs through the clothes.  There: a pair of RED PANTIES.

FLASHBACK - BEDROOM

Wearing nothing but the panties, Kimberly wiggles her ass at 
him, grins over her shoulder.

She turns, shakes RED CHEERLEADING POM-POMS that shes holding 
in front of her breasts.

END FLASHBACK

Kyle rubs his eyes.  Damn.

BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT

             KIMBERLY
	(V.O.)
           (urgent)
    Kyle.  Wake up.

Kyle wakes in a sweat.  Reaches for the lamp.

A SHADOW crosses in front of the door.  

He freezes.  Then shoots from the bed, races to the hallway.

             KYLE
    Kimberly.  Kim.

He looks around, hopeful.  

But no.  Hes alone.

LIVING ROOM - DAYS LATER

Rain lashes the windows.

Kyles on the sofa.  He stares at the TV.  Its OFF.

Lydias at the door.

             LYDIA
    Leftovers are in the fridge.  Ill 
    see you tomorrow?

Kyle doesnt respond.  She opens the door, and her umbrella. 


                                      6.
             KYLE
    Mom.  Be careful...
           (beat)
    In the rain.

There's no reply.  Kyle turns to his mom... but she's gone, 
and the door's closed.

INT. KITCHEN - MONTHS LATER

Kyle comes in through the back door.  His hairs a shaggy 
mess.  He's really let himself go. 

He drops groceries onto the table.  

Then: he hears hushed VOICES.  A conversation.  Words unclear. 

Someones here. 

             KYLE
    Mom?


He heads into...

DINING ROOM

Stops.  Listens.  Voices still muffled.

He moves more slowly, into...

LIVING ROOM

Cant get a bead on the voices.  Where are they coming from?

Then, suddenly, loud and clear:

             SAM
	(V.O.)
    Hey.  Its Sam.

There, right next to him: the ANSWERING MACHINE.

             SAM
	(V.O.)
    I dont even know if youre going to 
    hear this, but I gotta tell you, I 
    just saw your mom.  Shes real 
    worried about you.  We all are.  You 
    have to hang in there.  
           (beat)
    Just try.  Okay?

Kyle stares at the machine.


                                      7.
INT. BAR - A FEW NIGHTS LATER

Sam sucks the bottom from a MILLER LIGHT... belches.

             KYLE
    Forgot how classy you are.

             SAM
    Thats what happens when you ignore 
    your friends for three months.
           (studies Kyle)
    You look like shit.
           (beat)
    We all lost her.  We all miss her.

Kyle rubs his temples.  A FLASH behind his lids:

             SAM
	(V.O.)
           (muffled)
    I should have said something.

             KYLE
    What?


             SAM
    Sunday.  The guys.  A game.  You in?

Kyle hesitates.  Thats not what he heard.

             SAM
	(CONTD)
    Hey, no worries if its too soon. 

Nothing from Kyle.

             SAM
	(CONTD)
    Forget I mentioned it.  

             KYLE
    She was dumping me.  For good this 
    time.  Soon as we left the party, she 
    laid it on me.  Didnt want to marry 
    me.  Said she loved me.  But.

             SAM
    But what?


Kyles silent.  Sam seems desperate to know.

             SAM
	(CONTD)
    She loved you, but what?

             KYLE
    Thats it.  Last thing she said.  I 
    love you.  But.


                                      8.
INT. KYLES BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING

Kyle wears a PRESSED SHIRT, tucks the hem into his pants.  
Hair's still too long, but hes cleaner, shaved.  

He picks up a bouquet of PINK TULIPS.  Steels himself.

EXT. CEMETERY - THAT AFTERNOON

Kyle stares at an enormous bouquet of STARGAZER LILIES on a 
grave.  On the gravestone: KIMBERLY BROOKS 

He sets down his tulips next to the Stargazers.

             WOMAN
	(O.S.)
    Once upon a time there was a man.

Kyle turns.  No ones there.  Huh.

He rubs his temples.  Takes a TYLENOL BOTTLE from his pocket, 
dry-swallows a couple of TABS.

             WOMAN
	(O.S.)
	(CONTD)
    He was sad and alone.

He turns again... and sees MARLEY PHELPS (20s), standing 
around a headstone behind Kyle.  She looks familiar.

             KYLE
    Do I know you?

Marley shifts, looks around.  Hes definitely talking to her.          
She shakes her head.  No.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    Did you say something?

             MARLEY
    I didnt think youd hear me.

             KYLE
    Once upon a time?  Was that you?

             MARLEY
    I... tell stories.  For kids mostly.

             KYLE
    You write childrens books?

She thinks on that.  Nods, smiles.

             MARLEY
    I write childrens books.


                                      9.
Kyle studies her.  Shes a little strange.

             MARLEY
	(CONTD)
    You must have the worst headache.

How the...? Oh, the bottle of Tylenol in his hand.

             MARLEY
	(CONTD)
    You should eat.  Its time for lunch.

             KYLE
    I... guess it is.

She waits.  Expectant.  When Kyle says nothing:

             MARLEY
    Now you.

             KYLE
    What?



She's patient.  Kyles confused.

             MARLEY
    Okay, Ill do it.  Lets get lunch.

             KYLE
    Oh.  Thanks.  But I cant.

             MARLEY
    He smiles and says, That sounds 
    fun.

             KYLE
    Strange conversation were having.

             MARLEY
    He smiles and says, That sounds 
    fun.

Marley waits, then:

             MARLEY
	(CONTD)
    He says...


Its so weird, Kyle cracks a smile, and:

             KYLE
    That sounds fun?

             MARLEY
    It does, doesnt it?


                                     10.
EXT. PUBLIC PARK POND - LATER

Kyle and Marley crumble their left-over SANDWICH BREAD.

             KYLE
    Since when is there a pond here?

She shrugs.  Then squeals as a DUCK snaps at the bread in her 
fingers.  He studies her face.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    I do know you.  We've met.

Marley looks at him as if he's gone mental.

             MARLEY
    We have.  About an hour ago.  I was 
    there, you were there...

             KYLE
    Now you're just making fun of me.

             MARLEY
    Yes.


INT. KYLE'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

Kyle sits on the floor, stares at an OPEN BOX in front of him, 
jaw tight.  One of his hands is in a FIST.

In the box: Kimberlys belongings found in the car the night
of the accident.  Purse, shoes, scarf.

He picks up the DISCO BALL ORNAMENT, looks at it as it dangles 
from his fingers.

Lydia walks in.

             KYLE
    I hated this stupid thing.

             LYDIA
    Kyle.  Dont.

             KYLE
    I need to put these things away.

             LYDIA
    Leave them.  Ill do it.

             KYLE
    Her mother wants--

Lydia closes the lid.  Puts the box in the closet.


                                     11.
             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    How are we supposed to do this, Mom?

             LYDIA
    We keep going, best we can.  Let time 
    heal what we cant.  

She starts to head out...

             LYDIA
	(CONTD)
    I brought some dinner.  Come down.

She leaves him alone.

Kyle looks at his clenched fist.  Opens his fingers.

Kimberlys ENGAGEMENT RING twinkles in his palm.

EXT. CEMETERY - DAYS LATER

Kyle places more flowers on Kims grave.

He lingers, reads tombstones.  

Notices a small one.  Moves closer.

LAURA PHELPS, REST WELL SWEET ANGEL

             MARLEY
	(O.S.)
    My sister.


Kyles startled.  Turns to her.

             MARLEY
	(CONTD)
    She was my hero.  Loved me just the 
    way I was.  Didnt matter to her if I 
    was different.  Or sensitive.  I 
    wanted to be just like her.

             KYLE
    How old were you when she--

             MARLEY
    Just turned twelve.  Twins.

He looks at the dates on the stone.

             MARLEY
	(CONTD)
    Identical, in almost every way.

             KYLE
    What happened?


                                     12.
             MARLEY
    Oh, I dont tell sad stories anymore.  
    Im happy to see you again.  Walk?

EXT. PARK - LATER

             MARLEY
    Shoot.  I forgot to bring bread.

             KYLE
    There should be a...

Kyle immediately spots a HOT DOG VENDOR.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    There.  Well buy some. 

She smiles like he created the vendor out of thin air.

EXT. POND - LATER

Marley feeds one of the ducks. 

Kyle watches a RED MONARCH BUTTERFLY flutter on the far side 
of the pond.  Wings damaged, it struggles to stay airborne. 

             MARLEY
    You said she was your friend.  But 
    she was more, wasnt she?

The Monarch painfully flies across the pond... toward them.

             KYLE
    Yeah, she was more.

The butterflys almost there.  Closer... closer...

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    But she didnt make it.

Wings fail.  The Monarch drops onto the waters surface near 
the shore.  Struggles.

Kyle gently scoops it up.  His eyes drop to the water.  Hold 
up - somethings not right.

The ponds surface reflects an overhanging TREE BRANCH.  Kyle 
glances up, sees the branch right above him.  Looks back down, 
sees its reflection...

But not himself.  He moves closer to the waters surface.  
Nothing.  Like hes not even there.

What.  The.  FUCK?


                                     13.
Marley pretend-shoves him, breaks the moment.  She laughs.

The butterfly falls from Kyles hand, drifts away.

             MARLEY
    Oh, poor thing.

He looks again into the water.  Now his reflections there. 

Marley leans over his shoulder, peers into the water-mirror.

             MARLEY
	(CONTD)
    You look like a prince.  

INT. KYLES KITCHEN - THAT NIGHT

Kyle rolls pasta around a fork.

             LYDIA
    Sounds like a nice girl, so whats 
    going on inside that head of yours?

             KYLE
    I barely know her, but it's... shes 
    so easy to be with.  But, Kim.

             LYDIA
    Kimberly would want you to be happy.

             KYLE
    Would she?  I told her... I told her 
    it would be forever.

             LYDIA
    Oh, honey.  Thats not fair.

But for Kyle, the conversations over.

EXT. PARK

Kyle walks, looks around.  Finally, he sees her.  

Marley plucks BUDS from a cherry tree, uses her dress as a 
basket. 

She sees him, stares for a beat, then lets the blooms fall to 
the ground.

             MARLEY
    Youve decided not to see me.

Kyle stops.  How did she...?


                                     14.
             MARLEY
	(CONTD)
    Im not surprised.  Just sad.

             KYLE
    Ive just lost someone.  Im sorry, 
    Marley.  Its not you.  Its...

A BREEZE blows a swirl of blossoms from the tree.  Marley 
watches them drift to the grass, joining her dropped buds.

Kyle starts to go, but... she looks devastated.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
           (gives in)
    We can be friends, cant we?

A moment... then she brightens.

             MARLEY
    Well be friends.

Another WIND GUST, and blossoms surround her.  She smiles at 
him through the whirl of petals.

Its magical.

INT. KYLES BEDROOM - LATER

Kyle tosses his jacket onto the bed.  A CHERRY BLOSSOM falls 
from the fabric.  He picks it up.  Smiles.

He places it next to a PICTURE of Kimberly on his night stand.

INT. KYLES BEDROOM - LATE THAT NIGHT

A phone rings.  Kyles groggy, reaches for the cordless.  But 
thats not doing the ringing.

RING RING.  He gets up, grabs his cell.  Nope.

RING RING.  Where?  Wait... no.  No.

He moves to KIMBERLYs PURSE, opens it.  RING RING.  Her cell.  
The caller ID: UNKNOWN.

             KYLE
    Hello?


Crackles... distant voices... buzzing.  Through static:

             PHONE
	(V.O.)
    Can... ear me?  Come on... have to...


                                     15.
             KYLE
    Who is this?

The line goes dead - the phones out of juice.  Kyle pulls his 
cells charger, plugs it into Kims phone. 

He sits in a chair, stares at the phone... and waits.

MORNING

Kyle wakes.  Hes back in bed.  Reaches for Kims cell.  Its 
not there.

Wait... what?

He gets out of bed, looks for her purse.  

Its not where he left it.  Only one place left to look.

CLOSET

The box.  Kyle hesitates.  Pulls back the lid.

Kimberlys stuff: scarf, shoes, and... her PURSE.

Kyle grabs it.  Her phones inside. 

He checks the call history: NO NEW CALLS.  He throws the phone 
onto the bed.  Shit!

EXT. JOGGING TRAIL - THAT DAY

Kyle runs, Sam barely keeps up.

             SAM
    Thats some shit, dude.

             KYLE
    Swear it wasnt you?

             SAM
    Some sick prank?  Jesus.  No way.  

Kyle stops.  Sam pants.

             KYLE
    What then?  Think it has something to 
    do with... you know... 

He points to his head.

             SAM
    Okay.  Hang on.  You woke up in your 
    bed.  It was a dream.  


                                     16.
             SAM
	(CONT'D)
    An effed-up dream, but thats all.  
    Your heads fine.  Youre okay.  

INT. BATHROOM - LATER

Its steaming.  Kyle steps from the shower.  Wipes fog from 
the mirror.  As he wipes...

FLASHBACK - CAR

He angrily wipes fog from the cars windshield.

             KYLE
    Damn it.


END FLASHBACK

Kyle shakes away the memory.  Stares at himself.  Pushes back 
his long hair to reveal: a RED SCAR at his hairline.

He traces it.  Tugs at his hair.  Too long.

EXT. PARK - DAYS LATER

Kyles got a new haircut.  Marley studies the scar.

             MARLEY
    Does it hurt?

             KYLE
    Bad headaches, and sometimes things 
    are... strange.
           (beat)
    They said the accident couldve been 
    worse.  Im not so sure about that.

             MARLEY
    What happened?

             KYLE
    Kimberly... it was the night she... 

             MARLEY
    Oh.  Dont say any more.  Its okay.

             KYLE
    I think I need to talk about it.

Marley waits.  Finally:

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    It was raining.  Really coming down.  
    I was driving.  We were fighting.


                                     17.
LATER

Kyles finished his story.  They sit in silence, until...

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    Didnt mean to lay all that on you.

             MARLEY
    Its good.  Knowing these things 
    about you.  Knowing you.

A nice quiet between them.  Then:

             KYLE
    Lets get out of here.

LATER

They walk.  The moods lighter.

             KYLE
    I was the editor of my college paper.  
    Wanted to be a journalist. 

             MARLEY
    You gave it up?  Why?

             KYLE
    I dont know anymore.  Its the only 
    thing I was ever good at.

             MARLEY
    You should do it.  Be a writer.  Then 
    well both be storytellers. 

             KYLE
    Youre a good listener, Marley.  Im 
    glad I met you.

             MARLEY
    Me, too.  I like having a friend.

             KYLE
    You have friends.

             MARLEY
    None who talk with me the way you do.

INT. GROCERY STORE

Kyles at the MEAT COUNTER.  To the BUTCHER:


                                     18.
             KYLE
    Rib-eye.  Two please, fresh cut.  
    Special night tonight.

             BUTCHER
    You got it.

             LYDIA
	(O.S.)
    Kyle? 


Kyle looks, doesnt see her.  Huh. Turns back to the counter.

THUMP.  The butcher drops the ribsteak onto the SLICER.

The butchers shadow is against the wall, following his 
movements.  As he puts his hands on the machine, the shadow 
does too.  But: theyre not totally in sync.  Kyle sees it.

The butcher leans over the machine.  The shadow leans also: 
but LONG HAIR flows over the silhouettes shoulder.

The electric blade spins up.  Theres no WHIR sound.  Instead: 
the SCHLURP of sucking fluid, the SWHOOF of expelled air.

The shadows arm reaches for the slicer...

...and Kyle feels FINGERS through his hair.  He whirls.  
Lydia.  Her hand in mid-air.

             LYDIA
	(CONTD)
    Im sorry.  I thought you heard me.

Kyle glances back at the butcher.  BZZRD - the man makes a 
cut.  The machine sounds normal.  His shadows normal.

             KYLE
    Man, I am losing it.

             LYDIA
    Still fuzzy?

             KYLE
    Im so sick of this, mom.

             LYDIA
    My poor boy--

THUD.  The butcher drops the packed meat onto the counter.

             LYDIA
	(CONTD)
           (to Kyle)
    Who are these for?


                                     19.
INT. DINING ROOM - THAT EVENING

Kyle, Marley, and Lydia sit at the table.  Eating, laughing.

             MARLEY
    And Smelly Kelly rode away on her 
    bicycle made of feathers, never to be 
    heard from again.

Lydia applauds, catches Kyle watching Marley.  Likes it.

KITCHEN

Kyle helps Lydia load the dishwasher.  They speak low.

             LYDIA
    Can we keep her?

             KYLE
    Mom, I told you, its not--

             LYDIA
    Yes it is.  And its good. 

KNOCK.  KNOCK.  The back door.

Sam lets himself in.  Holds a SIX-PACK.

             SAM
    Hey.  Thought we could hang.  
           (beat)
    Am I interrupting something?

             LYDIA
    Were just having dinner with Marley.

             SAM
    Whos Marley?

EXT. PUBLIC PARK FIELD - AFTERNOON

Kyle, Sam, other MEN play rough touch football.  They form up 
for another play.

             SAM
    Its just like changing channels for 
    you, isnt it?  

             KYLE
    Leave it alone, Sam. 

Kyle calls the play.  The men scuffle around the field.  

Sam walks through the play, his back to Kyle.  


Kyle fires the ball, hits Sam in the head.  Sam turns, shoves.  
             SAM 
    How many times she break up with you?  

He twists his fists in Kyles collar.

                                     20.

             SAM
	(CONTD)
    Seven.  Seven times since we were in 
    the ninth grade-- 

             KYLE
    And she was about to do it again.  
    But she died.  What am I supposed to 
    do?  Pine forever?  Stop breathing?

Sam backs off.

             SAM
    Kimberly was too good for you. 

He stalks off the field.

EXT. POND - AFTERNOON

Kyle lies on the grass, lost in thought.  Marley studies him.

             MARLEY
    What are you thinking so hard about?

             KYLE
    Shes really gone.

His hair looks so shiny in the sun.  She reaches out... plucks 
a DANDELION instead.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    And now Sam.  Shit.

             MARLEY
    Its hard to be the one who messes 
    up.

           (off his look)
    I did it again, said too much.

             KYLE
    No, its... I swear its like youre 
    speaking my thoughts or something.

             MARLEY
    Sorry.



                                     21.
             KYLE
    Dont be sorry.  You understand me.  
    In a weird sort of way.

Marley flinches.  Turns away, she pulls a piece of her long 
hair into her mouth.  Chews nervously.

             MARLEY
    I dont like that word.  Weird.

             KYLE
    I wasnt saying youre weird.  Wait, 
    are you weird?

Hes teasing.  She sniffs her flower.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    You are, arent you?

He loops a finger into the hair, tugs it from her lips.

             MARLEY
    Im scared.

             KYLE
    Of me?

             MARLEY
    You look at me and you see me.  I 
    dont know what that means.

             KYLE
    Not following.

             MARLEY
    No one really sees me.

The sun beams around her.  Shes beautiful.

             KYLE
    How could anyone not see you?

INT. DEPARTMENT STORE

Lydia and Kyle roam the Mens section.  She picks a BLAZER.

             LYDIA
    Try this one on.  You want to look 
    casual but professional.

Kyle shrugs on the jacket.

             KYLE
    Sams right.  I am moving too fast.


                                     22.
             LYDIA
    What does Sam know?

             KYLE
    He was in love with Kim.

Lydia looks at him.  She knew that. She adjusts the collar.

             LYDIA
    I watched you with Kimberly since you 
    were ten years old.  Once you set 
    your heart on Kim, no one else would 
    do.  One thing I know about you, 
    youre a hopeless romantic. 

             KYLE
    Mom--

             LYDIA
    Youve got a lot of days ahead of 
    you.  They could all be like this 
    one.  Or, you could take a chance.  
    Set your heart on someone else.

Kyles silent.

             LYDIA
	(CONTD)
    Heres another thing I know.  Youve 
    never been a coward.  You fight for 
    what you want.  Question now is: what 
    do you want?

             KYLE
           (beat)
    You really can railroad a guy.

             LYDIA
    I'm your mother.  That's what I do.

INT. LIVING ROOM

Kyle and Marley are on the sofa.

             MARLEY
    Told you!  Im always right.

             KYLE
    I just showed him some editorials I 
    wrote in college, and bam.  Hired.

             MARLEY
    Youre a wonderful writer.


                                     23.
             KYLE
    You havent read anything Ive 
    written.

             MARLEY
    I dont need to.

She impulsively touches his chin, but pulls back right away.  
Her fingers go to her own mouth.  Her lips quiver.

He freezes.  Has anything so innocent ever been so sexy?

             MARLEY
	(CONTD)
    My stomachs all fluttery.

Kyles captivated, but... he takes her hands.

             KYLE
    Marley...


             MARLEY
    Dont you feel that?

He does, but...

             KYLE
    Im sorry.  Its too soon.

She slumps, stands to leave.

             MARLEY
    Okay.  Ill go.

             KYLE
    You dont have to leave.

At the door she turns back.

             MARLEY
    Ill wait for you, Kyle.

BEDROOM - LATER

Kyle yanks back the covers, crawls under.  

He tosses, opens his eyes.  Stares at the PHOTO OF KIMBERLY.  

Slides out of bed, walks over to the closet door.  Opens it.  
Looks at something on the floor.

Kimberlys belongings.


                                     24.
KITCHEN - NEXT MORNING

KNOCK.  KNOCK.  Lydia.

             LYDIA
    Are you sure, honey?

Kyle moves aside to let her in.  He turns, picks up the box.  

             KYLE
    Im sure. 


Lydia hugs her son, takes the box.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    And this.


The engagement ring.  Lydia takes it.

             LYDIA
    My brave man.  I love you.

EXT. CEMETERY

Kyle finds Sam putting flowers on Kims grave.

Sam turns.  Busted.  He runs his hand along the gravestone.

             SAM
    Marley.  She makes you happy?

A long beat.

             KYLE
    Im not going to give up the rest of 
    my life.  Kim wouldnt want me to.

             SAM
    I know.  Christ.  Lets get a beer.

EXT. PARK - A FEW DAYS LATER

Kyle holds a LARGE YELLOW KITE.  Passes it to Marley.

She runs.  Tries to get the kite to grab air.  She lets go.  
It drags behind her.

She turns with a pout.

             MARLEY
    We need some...

             KYLE
    ...wind or something.


                                     25.
A GUST sweeps by, tugs at the kite.  Yes!

Kyle hands her the REEL.  She lets the STRING run through her 
fingers.  The kite soars.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    Thats it.


He moves behind her, guides her hands.  

The kite yanks toward the sky.  Her fingers loosen. 

It starts to slip away...

Kyle wraps his hand around hers.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    Youre supposed to hold onto it.

             MARLEY
    But it's trying so hard to get away.  
    Shouldnt we let it go?

             KYLE
    No, thats the whole point.

             MARLEY
    But it looks so sad.

He gives the kite a confused look.  Ummm... Okay.

Marley sulks.  Reels in the kite.

             MARLEY
	(CONTD)
           (whispers to kite)
    Sorry.

PARK - LATER THAT DAY

Marley and Kyle walk.  He reaches out.  Their fingers touch... 
and he takes her hand.  She stops.

             KYLE
    Okay?

             MARLEY
    Yes.  Very.



They cross a SMALL STREET that cuts by the pond.

CHILDREN play in the park around them. 

             MARLEY
	(CONTD)
    Im really glad you and Sam made up.


                                     26.
             KYLE
    Marley.  Men dont make up.  We 
    just kind of say, Dude, you know how 
    it is and thats all right, man.  

             MARLEY
    Thats not making up?

             KYLE
    Nope.


He pulls her to a stop.  Gathers his courage, leans in. 

She raises her face, catches her breath...

Their lips touch.  The gentlest of kisses.  He pulls away.

             MARLEY
    That was--


Suddenly: her eyes widen.  She jerks away.

She rushes into the street, grabs a GIRL (5) off the blacktop.

Kyle trots toward her.  What the hell?

Marley marches fiercely toward the other kids.  She sets the 
little girl down, grabs another GIRL (12) by the shoulders.

             MARLEY
	(CONTD)
    Is this your sister?

The girl nods, frightened.

             KYLE
    Marley? 


             MARLEY
           (to the girl)
    Youre supposed to watch out for her.  
    Do you know what can happen if she 
    runs into the street like that?  You 
    have to always protect her.  Thats 
    your job.
           (coming unhinged)
    What if she... what if...

             KYLE
    Marley.


             MARLEY
           (to the girl)
    She could have been killed.  Your 
    mother would hate you for that.


                                     27.
The MOTHER storms in.

             MOTHER
    Take your hands off my daughter.  

             MARLEY
    You let her run into the street.

The kids are scared.  Crying.  The moms furious.  Kyles 
confused, concerned.

             KYLE
    Marley.  Stop.

She pulls away from him and runs.

             MOTHER
    Shes crazy.

EXT. CEMETERY - MOMENTS LATER

Marley slumps next to her sisters grave.  Kyle goes to her.

             MARLEY
    You can leave now, I know you want 
    to.

             KYLE
    Im not going anywhere. 

             MARLEY
    I didnt mean for it to happen, I 
    swear.  I miss her so much.

             KYLE
    Tell me.


             MARLEY
    No sad stories.

             KYLE
    Just this once?

Marley runs her fingers around a RUBY PENDANT she wears.

             MARLEY
    I always wore yellow.  No matter 
    what.  Yellow made me feel good.  
    Like sunshine.
           (beat)
    I was a weird kid.  Not like Laura.  
    Daddy said I was sensitive, but Mom 
    said... 


             MAR LEY	(CONT'D)
    I always knew she loved Laura more, 
    but that was okay, cause I loved her 
    more, too.

                                     28.

INT. GIRLS ROOM - FLASHBACK

Marley (12) and LAURA (12) speak, hushed.

             LAURA
    Its just for today.

Lauras decked out in BRIGHT YELLOW.  

             MARLEY
    But my yellow.

             LAURA
    Keep your ribbon.  This way youll 
    still have yellow, but everyone will 
    think youre me, and Im you.  

Marleys not convinced.  She pulls a lock of hair into her 
mouth.  Chews.

             LAURA
	(CONTD)
    Ill take care of Ben Pope and nobody 
    will ever mess with you again.  Ever.

Laura sweetly plucks the strands from her sisters lips.

EXT. SCHOOL BUS STOP - JUST OUTSIDE THEIR HOUSE

The girls wait for the bus in each others clothes.  Parked 
cars line the quiet street.

Lauras excited.  Marley, not so much.

             MARLEY
    Nobodys going to believe Im you.

             LAURA
    Yes, they will.  Oh, shoot.

She unlatches her necklace - the RUBY PENDANT.

             LAURA
	(CONTD)
    We forgot these.  Give me yours.

Marley removes her own YELLOW SAPPHIRE PENDANT, hands it over.  
Works at getting Lauras necklace around her own neck.

Laura grumbles.  Marley sees that her necklace is caught in 
her sisters hair.  Laura tugs the necklace...  


                                     29.
...it flies from her hand, lands in the street.  

Both girls laugh.

Marley clasps the ruby around her own neck.  She looks up:  

Lauras leaning between two parked cars to get the necklace.

Thats when Marley sees the CAR.  Laura steps into the 
street...

             MARLEY
    Laura!


Tires SCREECH.  A THUD.

The DRIVER jumps out.  

             DRIVER
    I didnt see her.  Oh, my God!

Marleys MOTHER rushes from the house.  Runs to Laura.  Tries 
to tend to her daughter... its no use.  Shes gone.

She pulls the girls broken body into her arms, howls.

Marley stands over Laura and her mother.

             MARLEY
    Im sorry.  Im sorry.

The woman grabs onto Marley, clutches her like a lifeline.

             MARLEYS MOM
    Oh, God.

             MARLEY
           (crying)
    Sorry.

             MARLEYS MOM
    Oh, Laura.  Sweetheart.  Thank God it 
    wasnt you.

The child in her arms stiffens.

The mom gets a good look at her face.  Oh, no.

The light goes right out of Marleys eyes.  Her spirit 
fades... then blinks out. 

             MARLEYS MOM
	(CONTD)
    Oh, no.  No, baby.  Marley.    


                                     30.
Nothing.

             MARLEYS MOM
	(CONTD)
    Marley?


EXT. CEMETERY - END FLASHBACK

             MARLEY
    I went to a hospital.  It got dark.  
    I dont remember much after it got 
    dark.  Just the hospital.  And the 
    plants, they let me water the plants.
           (beat)
    I shouldve put the necklace on her.  
    Im so stupid.  Stupid and broken.

             KYLE
    Its not your fault.  Look at me.

Her eyes meet his.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    You are not stupid.  Or broken.  
    Youre... perfect to me.

She looks at him, unwilling to believe...

             MARLEY
    Youre really staying?

             KYLE
    Im staying.  

Marley wipes her eyes.  He takes her hand, kisses her fingers.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    No more sad stories.  I promise.

INT. KITCHEN

On the table, remnants of a nice dinner.  

LIVING ROOM

Candles flicker.  Soft music plays. 

Kyle tends a FIRE.  Nervously adjusts the logs just so.  Looks 
around the room.

Theres an overwhelming romantic vibe.

             KYLE
    Im just realizing this is so staged.  
    Seduction super-cheese. 


                                     31.
Marley takes it in.  Kyle moves to sit beside her.  

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    I wanted it to be perfect for you.  
    This seemed, well...

             MARLEY
    I love what youve done.

Marley shyly touches his face.  His scar.

             MARLEY
	(CONTD)
    Im not the only mind-reader.

BEDROOM

Theyre on the bed, half-dressed.  Heavy petting.

Marley wrenches her mouth from Kyles.  Takes deep breaths.

             KYLE
    You okay?

             MARLEY
    Oh, yes.  I just...

             KYLE
    What?


Suddenly shes self-conscious.  Self-conscious and wanton.  A 
heady mix.  Her fingers clench and unclench in his hair.

             MARLEY
    I didnt know it would feel so good. 

Kyle studies her sweetly... kisses her again.

LATER

Kyle and Marley are curled together, asleep.  Blissful.  

Until Kyle twitches.  Moans.  Twitches again.

The SOUND of a car crash.

CUT TO: CAR

RAIN smacks against metal.  Kyle opens his eyes.

The rain drenches him through a gaping HOLE in the windshield. 
Flashing RED LIGHTS bounce off the DISCO BALL.

The reflected light makes it look like its raining blood.


                                     32.
He tries to move... hes pinned.

Kimberlys HAND is in his lap.  Red water pools in her palm.

             KYLE
    Kim?  Kimberly?  

Ringing on the cars center console: a CELL PHONE.  It rings 
and vibrates its way across the console...

...until KYLES able to read the display: KIM CALLING

INT. KYLES BEDROOM

Kyles eyes pop open.  Damn. He shakes off the dream. 

He rolls over to Marley-- and looks into the face of Kimberly.  

             KIMBERLY
    Dont do this.  Dont let go.

Kyle snaps fully awake.  Marley wakes, reaches for him. 

             KYLE
    Kim, no--


             MARLEY
    Its me.  Marley.  Its all right.  
    It was only a dream.

             KYLE
    I saw Kim.  It was so real.  Shes 
    haunting me.

             MARLEY
    Shes not haunting you.

             KYLE
    I hear her in my head, talking to me.  
    Telling me to listen to her.

Marley puts her hand on Kyles cheek...

             MARLEY
    Look at me.  Kyle.

...she moves his head so that their eyes meet.

             MARLEY
	(CONTD)
    Dont listen to her.  Listen to me.

Kyle looks at her.  A beat.  He pulls her to him.


                                     33.
INT. A NEW HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - A YEAR LATER

Kyle walks Lydia to the front door.

             LYDIA
    Sure you have nothing to tell me?

             KYLE
    Um... love you?

             LYDIA
    Why thank you, dear.  Anything else?

His grin nearly busts his cheeks.

             KYLE
    She said yes!

             LYDIA
    Ha!


She smothers him in a hug.

Suddenly, he grabs his head as agony stabs through it.

             LYDIA
	(CONTD)
    Kyle?  What is it?

The pain passes.  He relaxes.

             KYLE
    Its fine.  Im fine. 

             LYDIA
    How often does this happen?

             KYLE
    Just twinges now and then.  But 
    nothing like that.  Im okay now.

             LYDIA
    No.  The accident was two years ago.  
    Get it checked out.  Please. 

             KYLE
    Okay.  Fine.  I will.

Kyle opens the front door.

             LYDIA
    Beautiful night.  Look at those 
    stars.


                                     34.
Kyle looks up.  One STAR shines brighter than the rest.  It 
twitches.  Swells.

Suddenly the star SURGES at him, its hot light consumes 
everything as it hurtles towards him.

FWOMP!  Silence.  Kyles... somewhere.  No ceiling, no floor.  
Just white.  In every direction.

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(O.S.)
    Hey, there.  You with me?

INT. DOCTORS OFFICE - DAY

The whiteness drains away, the light fades.

             KYLE
    Sorry.  That was... so bright.

DR. BENEFIELD, the E.R. surgeon, releases his eyelid.  Pockets 
her pen-light. 

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Pupils are dilating fine.  You 
    havent hit your head?  Nothing?

             KYLE
    Um.  Not since the accident.

Benefield glances at an X-RAY IMAGE on a touch-screen tablet.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Scans are clean.   

             KYLE
    So Im okay?

             DR. BENEFIELD
    I cant explain the headaches and 
    that bothers me some, but theres 
    nothing physically wrong with you.  
    So, Ill tell you what I tell 
    everybody.  Try not to get too 
    stressed, get enough sleep - blah, 
    blah, blah.  Youre going to live a 
    good, long time. 

She writes out a scrip...  

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(CONTD)
    Take these if the headaches get too 
    bad.  Dont take too many at once, or 
    that whole living a good, long time 
    goes right out the window.


                                     35.
             KYLE
    Yes, maam.  Got it.

INT. KITCHEN - A FEW YEARS LATER

Marley, older and more beautiful, arranges PAPER-DOLL MAGNETS 
on the refrigerator.  Her wedding band sparkles.  

She hears the front door.  

             MARLEY
    Youre late.

             KYLE
    I have a surprise for you.

She looks at him, coy.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    Ha.  Youll get that surprise later.

He sweeps her up, settles her on the island counter.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    Guess who got his own column?

             MARLEY
           (playful)
    Who?  

             KYLE
    Uh-huh.  Thats it.

He slings her over his shoulder, heads out the kitchen.

BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

Marley pants against Kyles chest.

             MARLEY
    I like this surprise game.  I want to 
    give you one.

             KYLE
    Its your happily-ever-after.  You 
    can do whatever you want.

She reaches over the side of the bed.  Pulls up a GIFT.

Not what he expected, but okay.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    For me?



Marley nervously pulls some of her long hair into her mouth.  
He stops her with a smile. 

                                     36.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    Im sure Ill love it.

             MARLEY
    I hope so.  Because its done now.

Unwraps the present.  Freezes.

He tugs from the box a soft yellow BLANKET, a babys sleeper 
GOWN, and tiny SOCKS.

Silence.  Marley cant stand it anymore.

             MARLEY
	(CONTD)
    Do you like it?

             KYLE
    I love it.


BEDROOM - NINE MONTHS LATER

Marley sleeps on her side, Kyle behind her.  His hand rests on 
his wifes ripe abdomen, protecting.  

NURSERY - ONE WEEK LATER

Marley sits in a rocking chair, nursing her newborn DAUGHTER.

             MARLEY
    Just like a baby doll.

Kyles at the doorway.

             MARLEY
	(CONTD)
           (whispers to the baby)
    Elizabeth.  Daddys here.
           (to Kyle)
    We made her.

Kyle looks at his family.  Spellbound.  Takes Marleys hand.

             KYLE
    How did I ever find you?

LIVING ROOM - SEVEN YEARS LATER

The rooms lit only by the twinkle of a Christmas tree.

Two gorgeous girls, ELIZABETH (7) and SARAH (4), chase one 
another around the room, sticking GIFT BOWS to each other.


                                     37.
Marley and Kyle, worn out, snuggle in a corner of the couch.

Kyle sees something.  Near the tree, on the wall behind the 
girls.  Two SHADOWS.  

Theyre adult silhouettes, moving in silent conversation. 

             KYLE
    Girls.  Stop.  Be still.

The girls freeze.  Look to their father.

             MARLEY
    Oh let them be, theyll wear 
    themselves out soon enough.

But Kyle looks past them, to the shadows.  Still moving.

He reaches over, turns on the lamp.

Light fills the room, but the shadows remain.

             KYLE
    Marley, do you--

The silhouettes freeze, their heads snap toward him.

And then theyre gone.

             MARLEY
    What? 


             KYLE
           (beat)
    It was nothing.  Let's get to bed.

GIRLS ROOM - THAT NIGHT

Mom and Dad tuck in their angels.

             KYLE
    Night, sweethearts.

             MARLEY
    How much do I love you?

             ELIZABETH
    More than anything.

Marley cant help but say it:

             MARLEY
    And I love you both the same.


                                     38.
             SARAH
    Love you, too, Mommy.

She strokes their heads.  Her self-control suddenly snaps.  

             MARLEY
           (urgently)
    And remember, always watch out for 
    each other...

Kyle tugs Marley from the room.

HALLWAY

             KYLE
    Baby, youve got to stop telling them 
    those things.  

             MARLEY
    That I love them?

             KYLE
    You know thats not what I mean.

             MARLEY
    Im so afraid of messing up.

             KYLE
    You wont.  You wont.

EXT. FRONT YARD - THREE YEARS LATER

Elizabeth (10), Sarah (7), and Marley are dressed as FAIRIES, 
wings and all.  They run around the yard waving their WANDS.

Kyle laughs from the porch.

             SARAH
    Come on, Daddy.  Its fun.

             MARLEY
    They grow up so fast.

Marley flutters to the steps.  Plants a CROWN on his head.  

             KYLE
    There goes my manhood.

             MARLEY
    Play with us.  You have to.  Youre 
    my Prince Charming.

Sarah chases a BUTTERFLY: a red Monarch butterfly.  Shes 
almost got it... reaches out... just a foot from the street.


                                     39.
Marley stiffens.

             KYLE
    Sarah.  Not so close.

The Monarch flies away.  Sarah comes back into the yard.

Kyle watches the butterfly as it disappears into the sky.

EXT. STREET 

Kyle, briefcase in hand, gawks at a SIX FOOT WHITE PICKET 
FENCE that surrounds his entire property.  What the?

He walks around the fortress-like structure, finally locates a 
security DOOR. 

INT. LIVING ROOM

Kyle looks for Marley.

             KYLE
    Marley?  Whats with the fence?

He heads up the stairs.  Peeks into the girls room.  His 
daughters lie together on a bed, crying.

GIRLS ROOM

Kyle soothes the girls.

             KYLE
    What happened?  

             SARAH
    I didnt mean to.  Our ball bounced 
    and then it was in the street.

The street.  Oh no.

             KYLE
    Wheres Mommy?

The girls cry harder.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    Where is she?

             ELIZABETH
    We cant find her.

HOUSE - VARIOUS

Kyle frantically searches each room.  Nothings out of place.  


                                     40.
The only thing missing: Marley.

He races to the front door.

EXT. HOUSE

Its dark out.  

Kyle steps into the yard.  Cold wind rips the trees, storm 
clouds churn overhead.

He crosses the yard, toward the street.  As he nears the 
pavement...

CRACK!  Lightning burns the clouds - down the street, a 
TRANSFORMERs hit.

BOOM!  The transformer explodes in fireworks of sparks.  Then:

Pop... pop...

Whats that? Kyle fights to see through the hard wind.  

At the end of the block the STREET LIGHTS are popping off, one 
by one, the outage heading toward KYLE...

...pop... POP... POP...

Inky blackness rolls behind the popping lights, like a dark 
tidal wave surging toward him.

The light above him POPS out and darkness slams down on Kyle.

He tries to see through the night.  Holds out a hand.  His 
palms visible, but his fingers disappear into shadow.

             KYLE
    Marley!  Marley!

A small SCREAM, behind him.  Its Sarah and Elizabeth, in the 
doorway, terrified.

Kyle runs back to the house, picks them up.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    Storms coming.  Lets get tucked in.

             ELIZABETH
    I want Mommy.

             KYLE
           (beat)
    Me too, honey.


                                     41.
BEDROOM - LATER

Kyle lies on the bed, a child tucked in each arm.  He stares 
blankly at the ceiling.

The children stare blankly, too.

The sun comes up, goes down, and comes up again.  

All while they lie motionless.

KITCHEN

The kids eat Cheerios.  Kyle stares at his bowl, untouched.

GIRLS ROOM

Kyle brushes Sarahs hair.  Elizabeth sits at his feet.  Reads 
a childrens book.

Kyle glances at the pages as she turns them.

She gets to a page thats been completely BLACKED OUT with a 
marker.  She flips past it.

             KYLE
    Wait.  That page.  Turn back.

She does.  Its not blacked out at all.  Just an illustration 
of a duck pond.  Like the one Kyle and Marley visit.  How?

Elizabeth closes the book.  The cover: Liza Saves the World, 
by Marley Lafferty.

LIVING ROOM

Kyle watches as dust floats in the air.  His eyes track one 
mote, then another.  

The SCRAPE of a key.  The front door swings open.  Marley.

Kyle rushes for her.  Stops short.  Somethings off.

             KYLE
    Where have you been?

She shrugs.  He approaches slowly.  Gently embraces her.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    Youre freezing.  Where did you go?  

             MARLEY
    I dont know.  


                                     42.
Kyle pulls her to the couch.  

             KYLE
    I came home and you werent here.  
    What happened?

             MARLEY
    It was... dark.  I dont know.

             KYLE
    Honey help me out.  You disappeared. 

Marley sits.  Unblinking.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    Marley.

Nothing.  He snaps.


             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    Youve been gone for two days.  Where 
    the fuck were you?

That gets her attention.

             MARLEY
    Dont say that word to me.

             KYLE
    Then answer me.

             MARLEY
           (getting hysterical)
    I dont know.  I dont know.

             KYLE
    Im sorry.

             MARLEY
    I dont like when you yell.

             KYLE
    Im not yelling now.  Help me 
    understand.  That fence...

             MARLEY
    Something happened.  I needed a 
    fence. 

             KYLE
    The girls told me.

             MARLEY
    And you still love me?


                                     43.
Such a simple question.  

             KYLE
    God, honey.  Yes.

She flies into his arms.  

BEDROOM

Kyle watches Marley sleep.  

She opens her eyes.  Stares into his.

             MARLEY
    You're leaving me.

             KYLE
    What?  Marley, no.  Im not leaving.

But its clear she doesnt believe him.

LATER

Kyle wakes.  Alone.  Oh, no.  

He tries to stay calm.  Slips from the bed. 

GIRLS ROOM

Kyles in the doorway.  Marley lies on one of the beds, curled 
up with both girls wrapped around her.

Her broken whispers drift into the hall.

             MARLEY
    I love you.  I love you.  I love you.

HOME OFFICE - DAYS LATER

The girls play a BOARD GAME on the floor.

Kyle types on his laptop.  The screen flickers.  Shit.

He checks the power plug in the back.  Its fine.

But behind the laptop, peeking out underneath: some PAPERS.

He pulls them out.  Theyre ILLUSTRATIONS - all scribbled 
through with a black marker.

             KYLE
    Elizabeth.  You do this?


                                     44.
             ELIZABETH
    No.


             SARAH
    Mommy did that.  Its her new book.

Kyle stares at the pages.

             KYLE
           (calls out)
    Marley?

STAIRS

He heads up the stairs.  Stops.  

Theres a BRIGHT YELLOW PILL on the step.  What the hell?

Two more steps.  A PINK TABLET.  Then a GREEN, two RED.

HALL

Outside the bedroom door theres an empty PILL BOTTLE.  He 
picks it up.  No label.  Empty.

BEDROOM

Dozens more empty bottles are piled on the bed.  All empty.

He looks around.  The bathroom door.  Closed.

No.  Please, God.

He rushes to it.  Locked.  He pounds on the door.

             KYLE
    Marley!


A mumble from inside.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    Open the door.

Marley cracks the door and slips through, one fist clenched.  

             MARLEY
    What?  I didnt want to be 
    interrupted.

He grabs her by the shoulders.  Notices her closed hand.  
Pries it open.  More pills.

He tries to take them but her hand shuts tight.


                                     45.
             KYLE
    How many did you take?

             MARLEY
    Why are you mad?

He tries to force open her hand.

             MARLEY
	(CONTD)
    Dont.  I need those.

             KYLE
    Where did you get all these?

             MARLEY
    Theyre pills.

             KYLE
    I know theyre pills, Marley.  

             MARLEY
    Theyre mine.

             KYLE
    How many did you take?

             MARLEY
    Stop it.

             KYLE
    How many?

             MARLEY
    All of them.

She jerks back into the bathroom.  Slams and locks the door.

             KYLE
    Marley!  Damn it.

He beats against the door.  Stands back, kicks at the knob.  

CRACK!

BATHROOM

Inside, Marleys kneeling, completing her task.  She turns, 
scowls at the ruined door.

             MARLEY
    Look at what you did.

But Kyles looking at the floor.


                                     46.
On the marble: an immaculate MOSAIC OF A STARGAZER LILY.  

Made completely of pills.

INT. HOSPITAL

Kyle seems lost in the emergency room crowd.  Hes looking for 
someone.  Moves to the nurses station.

             KYLE
    Im looking for Dr. Benefield.

             NURSE
    Her office is in the medical plaza.

The nurse looks over Kyles shoulder.

             NURSE
	(CONTD)
    Lucky you.


Benefield pulls a SCRUB CAP off her head. 

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Kyle.  Headaches again?

             KYLE
    Its my wife.

HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

Benefield strides down the hall.  Kyle struggles to keep up.

             DR. BENEFIELD 
    How many did she take?

             KYLE
    None.  Technically.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    You should talk to a psychiatrist.  
    You dont want a neurosurgeon telling 
    you how to think.  Believe me.

             KYLE
    Youre the only doctor I know.

Kyle peeks into the passing rooms, filled with injured people.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Ill be happy to recommend someone.  
    In fact, Ive got a good friend...

Her voice fades.  It suddenly sounds as though Kyles hearing 
Benefield through a waterfall.


                                     47.
Other hospital sounds filter through the roar.  Theres a 
steady BEEPING.  Also, the muffled CONVERSATIONS of nurses.

             NURSE
	(O.S.)
    We wont know anything until the 
    doctor returns.  Shell be able to...

A woman cries.  Hushed tones of sympathy.

             FEMALE DOCTOR
	(O.S.)
    It may be a few weeks.  It may be 
    longer.  Its just too early to tell.

Kyle passes another room.  Catches sight of a WOMAN leaning 
over a wreck of a MAN.  One leg hangs in traction.  The 
patients head is heavily bandaged.

Kyles vision goes blurry, dim.  He tries to shake it off.

His legs turn lead-heavy, fighting each step.

             KYLE
           (croaks)
    Dr. Benefield.

His knees hit the floor.  Benefield turns, runs to him.  Kyle 
can barely see her.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    What is it?


             KYLE
    Cant... I cant... see.

INT. MRI MACHINE

Kyle stares at the slick white interior of the MRI.  The 
machine scans his brain, CLICKS echo in surround sound.

             KYLE
    I told you its fine now.

Benefields tinny voice filters in from a speaker:

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(O.S.)
    Be still.  Go to your happy place.

INT. HOSPITAL OFFICE

On an LCD screen, Benefield shows Kyle his MRI results.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Nothing abnormal.  Or if there is, I 
    cant find it.


                                     48.
             KYLE
    Then theres nothing wrong.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    The scan says no, but... we cant 
    pretend to know exactly what goes on 
    in the human brain.  Theres still so 
    much were finding out.
           (re: the scan)
    Something is hiding from me, and I 
    dont like it.

INT. GIRLS ROOM - LATER THAT DAY

Kyles in the doorway, stunned.

All the furnitures crammed into one corner.  A large paint-
spattered TARP covers the carpet. 

Brightly-colored small, medium, and large hand and footprints 
climb one wall.  The opposite walls smeared with artful 
juvenile body splats.

Is that a purple butt mark?  

He presses his palm against one of the tiny handprints.

He squinches his eyes shut.  Rubs his temples.

             KYLE
    Ow, damn.


BATHROOM

Kyle steps into the bathroom.  His familys in the tub.

They look like a set of Russian Nesting Dolls.  Three matching 
human angels, each one smaller than the next. 

Marley and the girls are up to their necks in bubbles.   

Streaks of paint run across their necks and shoulders.  They 
giggle.  Innocent.  Beautiful.

He hears a slight pounding in his ears.

             MARLEY
    Hey, you.  Come here.

             ELIZABETH
    Daddy.  We decorated our room.

Kyle chuckles.  Painfully.  It hurts.


                                     49.
             KYLE
    I saw that.  

Pain stabs through his head.  His eyes close.

             MARLEY
    Kyle?


Blood roars in his ears.  

             MARLEY
	(CONTD)
    Honey?

His knees buckle.


             MARLEY
	(CONTD)
    Kyle!


She scrambles from the tub.  The girls whimper.

Marley rushes to Kyle.  He looks into her face.

CUT TO: FUTURE

Marleys in her 40s.  She lays that winning smile on him.

             MARLEY
    Kyle, hes only a boy.  

Elizabeth, a lovely teen, glowers at him.

             ELIZABETH
    This is so not fair.

Marley whispers in his ear.

             MARLEY
    Its her first date, behave yourself.

CUT TO: PRESENT

A wet, naked Marley cradles Kyles head.

             MARLEY
    Please dont do this.

FUTURE

Kyle dips Marley in a sweeping flourish.  Both in their late 
40s.  He captures her lips in a passionate kiss.  

Sarah, a half-grown rebel, turns up her nose.


             SARAH    Oh, God.  Spare me.  

A laughing Kyle lunges for his daughter, who squeals and runs.

                                     50.

PRESENT

The children cry.

             MARLEY
    No.  No, dont go.  No more sad 
    stories.  You promised.

FUTURE

Kyle stands at the altar.  Elizabeth, the bride, on his arm.

             PREACHER
    Who gives this woman to be wed?

             KYLE
    Her mother and I do.

PRESENT

Kyles body seizes, his eyes roll back.

             KYLE
    Marley...


             MARLEY
    Im right here.

FUTURE

Marley and Kyle, in their fifties, stand at the hospital 
bedside of Sarah, in her 20s.

She holds a NEWBORN CHILD in her arms.

             KYLE
    Will you look at that.

PRESENT

Kyle goes limp.  

             MARLEY
    You said you wouldnt leave me.

She cries, full of anguish.  The sound slowly mutates into a 
low-level HUM.  Her voice fades.


                                     51.
             MARLEY
	(V.O.)
    I love you. 

A mechanical hum.  Then into a rhythmic BEEP... BEEP... BEEP.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Kyles eyes open.  

His POV: intense light, two NURSES leaving the room.  

He tries raising his hand, fumbles with the IV in his arm.

             NURSE
	(O.S.)
    Left my pager.  Meet you down there.

Through watery eyes, Kyle sees the nurse re-enter.  His hand 
trembles mid-air.

             NURSE
	(CONTD)
    Page Dr. Benefield! 

Kyle tries to speak.  But instead, slips back into darkness.

HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER

His eyes open again.  Benefield leans over him. 

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Welcome back, Mister.  You gave us 
    quite a scare.  Can you hear me?

Kyle tries to nod.  His head bobs like a marionette.  He tries 
to speak, throat like sandpaper.

             KYLE
    My--


             DR. BENEFIELD
    Dont talk.  

             KYLE
           (rasps)
    My wife.

His... oh, her.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Dont try to move.  Ill get her.

She leaves.

Voices outside the room:


                                     52.
             WOMAN
	(O.S.)
           (tearfully)
    Can I talk to him?

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(O.S.)
    He wont be able to carry on much of 
    a conversation, but he can hear you.

Benefield comes back in.

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(CONTD)
    Someones very happy youre awake.

A WOMAN comes into the room.

It cant be.

KIMBERLY.  ALIVE.  Still 24 years old.

Her right arms in a sling, a fresh scars on her forehead.

She leans over to stroke his hair.

             KIMBERLY
    Hey.  Oh, my God.  Hey.

Kyle stares, eyes wide.  Disbelieving.  

Hand trembling... he reaches out.  No.  She cant be here.

His fingertips touch her cheek.  She smiles.

He recoils.

             KYLE
           (fights to speak)
    N... no...

She holds his hand to her cheek, tears slide onto his fingers.

             KIMBERLY
    Its okay.  Youre awake now. 

Kyle takes a gulping breath.  Lungs heave.  Eyes slide shut.

             KIMBERLY
	(V.O.)
    Kyle!


INT. KYLES AND MARLEYS BEDROOM

Kyle lies on his bed.  Marley strokes his hair.  

             KYLE
    What happened?


                                     53.
             MARLEY
    You fell in the bathroom.

She clings to him.  

             MARLEY
	(CONTD)
    I thought you were really gone.

INT. KYLES HOSPITAL ROOM - EVENING

Kyles eyes open.  The hospital.

His sees a vase: two Stargazer Lilies.  

Lydia sits in the bedside chair, talking softly, as if to 
herself.  Her hand absently strokes his arm.

She doesnt notice hes awake.

             LYDIA
    Looks like it might rain from now on.  
    Its drowning my roses.  Someone 
    brought you lilies.  Pretty ones.

             KYLE
    Mom.


Lydia gasps.  Plants mommy-kisses all over his face.

             LYDIA
    I thought Id never hear that again.

             KYLE
    Whats wrong?  

             LYDIA
    Youre in the hospital, honey.   

             KYLE
    I fell.  Hit my head, I think.

             LYDIA
           (beat)
    Do you remember anything?

Kyle looks confused.

             LYDIA
	(CONTD)
    You were in a car accident, with Kim. 

             KYLE
    Mom, that was years ago.

Now Lydias confused.  Years ago?


             LYDIA    Youve been... asleep.  In a coma.

                                     54.

             KYLE
    What?  
           (beat)
    How long?

             LYDIA
    Five weeks.


             KYLE
    Wheres Marley?

             LYDIA
    Who?


Kyle blinks.  Wait.  

Accident.  Coma.  Five weeks.  Thats impossible.  

Wait...

FLASHBACK - CAR

Kyle drives.  Looks over at Kimberly.  

             KIMBERLY
    I love you, Kyle.  I do, but--

FLASHBACK - TRAUMA UNIT

Fluorescent lights overhead.

Kyle watches nurses work on Kimberly.

Benefields face leans over him...

             DR. BENEFIELD
    What do we have?

FLASHBACK - BEDROOM

Marley holds him close.

             MARLEY
    I thought you were really gone.

END FLASHBACKS - PRESENT

             KYLE
    Ive gotta get out of here.

Kyle starts to sit up, but he cant move his right leg.


                                     55.
Hes got a full CAST, hip to ankle.

             LYDIA
    Its over now.  Things will be back 
    to normal in no time.  Youll see.

He starts ripping the IVs from his hands.  Tries to stand.

             LYDIA
	(CONTD)
    Nurse!  I need a nurse in here.

Kyles good leg crumples beneath him.  Lydia breaks his fall.

             LYDIA
	(CONTD)
    Someone, please!

Two NURSES rush into the room.  

One injects Kyle with a SYRINGE.  They get him back into bed.

Kyles eyes slump, getting groggy...

             KYLE
    I dont... Kimberlys alive?

             LYDIA
    Of course she is, darling.  Shes 
    been here every day.  

Kyle fights the sedative, but it pulls him under.

KYLES HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER

Kyles upright in the bed.  Benefield reads his chart.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    I had no idea you were going to be so 
    much trouble.  
           (beat)
    Blurry vision?  Headache?  Dizziness?

She pulls the covers over Kyles plastered leg.

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(CONTD)
    You have any idea how lucky you are 
    you didnt re-injure this?

He ignores her.

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(CONTD)
    Chart says theyre removing the cast 
    tomorrow.  Good news, huh?

Silence.


                                     56.
Finally:

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(CONTD)
    Listen here, Im pretty sure I didnt 
    tinker with your vocal chords, and I 
    know you dont have brain damage.  So 
    you want to explain the freak-out?

             KYLE
    This is not where Im supposed to be.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Where else would you be?

He hesitates.  Should he?

THUNDERING FOOTSTEPS in the outside hall...

Sam bursts into the room.  He immediately breaks into a 
touchdown-style VICTORY DANCE.

             SAM
    Bro, youre awake.  Thats what Im 
    talking about. 

Sam sees Benefield.

             SAM
	(CONTD)
    Ill come back.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Oh, I dont think so.  You stay right 
    here, Bro.
           (to Kyle)
    Any symptoms and you have one of the 
    nurses call me, got it?  

She heads out.

             SAM
    Dude, this is so--

             KYLE
    Thought maybe youd be glad to be rid 
    of me.  

             SAM
           (beat)
    What kind of drugs they giving you?

             KYLE
    Is something going on?  With Kim.  
    And you?


                                     57.
             SAM
    What the hell, Kyle?  Id never do 
    that to you.  Never.

Kyle reads his friend.  Sams telling the truth.

             KYLE
    Shit.


Sam relaxes.  Sits in the chair.

             SAM
    The hell did that come from?

LATER

Sams more than a little stunned.  

             SAM
    A hallucination, maybe.  Dream?  It 
    wasnt real.

             KYLE
    It felt real.  Still feels real.  

             SAM
    Come on--


             KYLE
    What if I told you that nothing you 
    know is real: Kim, me, your parents--

             SAM
    Okay, thats jacked up.
           (beat)
    Wait.  What about Kim?  Do you...?

Sam waits for the answer.

             KYLE
    That was twenty years ago. 

             SAM
    That was last month.  You best--

             KIMBERLY
	(O.S.)
    Hey, fellas.  This the party room?

Kimberly.  A duffle in hand.  Sam stands.

             SAM
    Yep.  Party room.  Whoop!

Kimberly chuckles... then starts to cry. 


             KIMBERLY    God, Kyle, I was so scared.

Kyle stares, still cant believe hes seeing her again.

                                     58.

             KYLE
    Kim...


             KIMBERLY
    I know.  I know.

She rushes to the bed, hugs him.

Behind her, Sam motions for Kyle to hold her.  Kyle doesnt.  
Kim lifts her head, wipes her tears.

             KIMBERLY
	(CONTD)
    Look at me, blubbering.

She looks between the two of them.

             KIMBERLY
	(CONTD)
    Were you two fussing?

             KYLE
    We were just--

             SAM
    Kyle had a nightmare.  

Kim rubs Kyles chest.

             KIMBERLY
    Its okay now.  Im right here.

An echo:

             MARLEY
	(V.O.)
    Im right here.

Kyle grabs Kimberlys hand, lifts it off his chest.

Sam intercepts, puts his hand over both of theirs.

             SAM
           (to Kyle)
    But thats all it was.  Just a dream. 

HOSPITAL ROOM - NEXT MORNING

Lydia shaves Kyles face.  

             KYLE
    I can do this myself.


                                     59.
             LYDIA
    Almost done.

She wipes off traces of shaving cream.  Hands him a MIRROR.

             LYDIA
	(CONTD)
    There.  Good as new.

Kyle stares at his 24-year-old face.  So young.

             KYLE
    I look like a kid.
           (beat)
    God, I am a kid.

HOSPITAL ROOM - THAT NIGHT

Kyle wakes to see Kimberly prepping a makeshift BED across two 
chairs.  She pulls a blanket from her duffle.

Its covered in RED MONARCH BUTTERFLIES.

FLASHBACK - POND 

A red butterfly drops onto the waters surface.  Drifts away.

FLASHBACK - FRONT YARD

Sarah chases a red butterfly toward the street.

END FLASHBACKS

             KYLE
    Let me see that.

             KIMBERLY
    Sorry, I wake you up?

             KYLE
    The blanket.

Confused, she hands it over.  He studies the butterflies.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    Did you sleep here while I was...

             KIMBERLY
    Yeah.  A few times.

             KYLE
    Did you say anything to me?


                                     60.
             KIMBERLY
    I asked you to wake up.  Id tell you 
    not to--

             KYLE
    Let go.  You said that, didnt you?  
    Dont let go.

             KIMBERLY
    Thats right.

Kyle tries to process this. 

Kimberly misunderstands his silence.

             KIMBERLY
	(CONTD)
    Im sorry.  About the wreck.  Your 
    leg.  The way this all happened.
           (beat)
    What I said, in the car...

             KYLE
    I almost got you killed, Kim.

             KIMBERLY
    I distracted you.

             KYLE
    Dont.


Kyle gives her the blanket.  Closes his eyes.

             KIMBERLY
    Tired?


Awkward silence.

             KIMBERLY
	(CONTD)
    You asking me to leave?

Kyle doesnt answer.

             KIMBERLY
	(CONTD)
    Okay, then.  Ill see you tomorrow.  

She leaves.  He presses the call button.  A moment, then:

             NURSE
    Are you all right?

             KYLE
    My legs killing me.  Can I get more 
    morphine?


                                     61.
A FEW MINUTES LATER

Benefield strolls in.  Checks his I.V. line.

             DR. BENEFIELD 
    You want more dope?  Forget it.

             KYLE
    Do you live here?

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Sure seems that way.  Here, best I 
    can do.

Hands him a tiny PILL CUP.  Kyle takes it.  Ponders...

             KYLE
    Do you believe in love?

She looks at him.  He looks right back at her.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Im a scientist.  I require proof, 
    with my own eyes, before I believe in 
    anything.  That said, Ive seen the 
    way your mother loves you.  Your 
    girlfriend and your friend Sam.  They 
    love you.  Is that what you mean?

             KYLE
    No.  But I have my answer.  Thanks.

BEEP.  Benefield presses STOP on the bedside INFUSION PUMP.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    Whats that? 

             DR. BENEFIELD 
    Your morphine.  Talk or suffer.  
    Whos Marley?  Ex-girlfriend?

He studies her.  Shes sincere. 

             KYLE
    Do people in comas... dream?

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Tell me why youre asking, Ill tell 
    you what I know.

             KYLE
    Youre tough.  Okay.  I have... 
    another life.  A wife.  Marley.  


                                     62.
             KYL E
	(CONT'D)
    Two daughters.  I have to get back 
    there.  They need me.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    I dont understand.  When was this?

             KYLE
    Yesterday.  

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Yesterday you were here.  And the day 
    before that, and the day before that.

             KYLE
    But you were there, too.  You were my 
    doctor.

             DR. BENEFIELD
           (beat)
    Maybe you heard me talking.  In 
    comas, some people are still aware--

             KYLE
    But I saw you there.  We had 
    conversations.  

             DR. BENEFIELD
    You opened your eyes a lot.  Looked 
    right at me.  Maybe these dreams you 
    had, you incorporated me, and other 
    people, into them.  People you saw.

             KYLE
    What about Marley?  My kids. 

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Let me ask you something.  That 
    family with Marley, the kids, was it 
    the perfect version of your life?

Kyle doesnt answer.  He doesnt need to.

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(CONTD)
    Kyle, your familys here.  In this 
    room every day, waiting and praying 
    for you to heal.  Perfect or not, 
    they love you.  And they need you.  
    More than you need your dreams.

Benefield releases the closure on the IV, walks to the door.

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(CONTD)
    Hey.  Youre going to be all right.


                                     63.
LATER

Kyle drifts off...

CUT TO: KYLE AND MARLEYS HOUSE

Kyle looks around his living room.

Theres his furniture.  The BOOKCASE with Marleys books. 

He picks The Incredible Misadventures of Ally the Brat. Runs 
his fingers across the cover.

Suddenly, he realizes where he is.  He races into the kitchen.

Yes!  Its all still here.

Up the stairs.  His legs churn.  No cast.  No injury.

             KYLE
    Marley!  Girls!

He bursts through the bedroom door...

INT. KYLES HOSPITAL ROOM

Kyle wakes.  Looks around the hospital room.

He runs his hands over his chest, as if hes lost something.

             KYLE
    No, damn it.

INT. KYLES HOSPITAL ROOM - NEXT DAY

Kimberly stands over Kyles bed, duffle clutched in her fist.   
Theyre fighting.

             KYLE
    I cant do it again, Kim.

             KIMBERLY
    If youd tell me whats going on with 
    you maybe I could help.

             KYLE
    You cant.

             KIMBERLY
    You dont know that.

Kyle watches her, comes to a realization.  And very 
inappropriately, he laughs.


                                     64.
             KIMBERLY
	(CONTD)
    Whats funny about this?  

             KYLE
    Dont you see?  Were so young.  This 
    fight, this scene, its ridiculous.  
    Cant we just be honest for once?

             KIMBERLY
    Honest about what?

             KYLE
    Why were you breaking up with me?  
    Breaking up with me again, I mean.  
    Come on, Kim.  Lay it on me.

Kimberly stares.  Then she turns on her heel... and is gone.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    Ah, shit.


HOSPITAL THERAPY ROOM

Kyle forces each step.  He white-knuckles the support bars.

He starts to fall.  The physical therapist, HENRY, grabs him.

             HENRY
    Youre almost there.  A few more.

Benefield walks in.

             KYLE
    Just in time for the show, Doc.

             HENRY
    Hes doing fine.

Kyles knees give out.  He hits the floor.

             KYLE
    Damn it.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Thats enough for today.

MINUTES LATER

Benefield wheels Kyle down the hall.

             KYLE
    Whens the last time you pushed a 
    wheelchair?  Dont you have, like, 
    people to do this?


                                     65.
             DR. BENEFIELD
    Ha ha.  I wanted to talk to you.

KYLES HOSPITAL ROOM

Benefield helps Kyle out of the wheelchair.  An iPad lies on 
the bed - Benefield picks it up as Kyle climbs into bed.

The iPad opens to a PHOTO of Kyle, Kimberly, and Sam.  Kims 
in a cheerleading uniform, Kyle and Sam in football gear.

She swipes the touchscreen.  Another PIC of Kyle with friends.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Looking through old memories?

             KYLE
    Looking for Marley.

Oh. Benefield puts the iPad on the nightstand.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    I thought maybe Id seen her 
    somewhere.  Hard to believe I just 
    made her up.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Thats what I wanted to talk to you 
    about.  Ive been doing some reading.  
    About coma cases and dreams.

Kyle looks up, hopeful.

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(CONTD)
    Seems its pretty common.  People 
    wake up with memories that never 
    happened.  Because they dreamed them.

Kyle deflates.

             KYLE
    Its true, then.  Theyre gone. 

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Theyre not gone, Kyle.  They were 
    never here.  

LATER THAT EVENING

Kyle looks through more photos.  Studies them.  Finds nothing.  
Tosses the iPad onto the chair.

             KYLE
    Just a dream.  A fucking dream.


                                     66.
He looks up: Kimberlys at the door.

Kyle tries, but cant contain it: he starts to sob.

             KIMBERLY
    Kyle.


She goes to him.  He reaches out, grabs her hand. 

She sits on the bed, wraps her arms around him.

MORNING

Kyle stirs.  Burrows closer to the warm body in his bed.

Fingers brush across his forehead.  His eyes slowly open.

             KIMBERLY
	(O.S.)
    Youre awake.

Kimberly keeps stroking his hair.  He squeezes his eyes shut.

             KYLE
    Yeah.  Im awake.

Suddenly, Kimberly freezes.  Shes staring at the door.

Sams there.

             SAM
    Right.  Okay.  Good.

But its not good.  Sam leaves. 

             KYLE
    You want to go after him?

             KIMBERLY
           (beat)
    No.

MID AFTERNOON

Kyle ignores the lunch in front of him.

             LYDIA
    Spit it out.  Whats wrong?  

             KYLE
    Do you think Im the type to settle?

             LYDIA
    Kim said she stayed here last night.


                                     67.
Kyle nods.

             LYDIA
	(CONTD)
    If settling means youll be happier, 
    why not? 

           (beat)
    Not the answer you wanted?

             KYLE
    I dont know anymore.

LATER THAT NIGHT

Kyle sleeps.  Eyelids twitch.

CUT TO: KYLE AND MARLEYS BEDROOM

Kyles in the bed.  He opens his eyes.

Marleys by the window.  Shes been crying.  

He gets up, reaches for her.  She stops him.

             MARLEY
    If you love her, why are you here?

He takes her in his arms.  She pushes him away, hard.

             MARLEY
	(CONTD)
    Go back to her, then.  Just go.

KYLES HOSPITAL ROOM

Kyle wakes in a sweat.

HOSPITAL THERAPY ROOM - NEXT DAY

Sam watches Kyle work through his steps.  

             SAM
    Man, I wish I could do that for you.

Kyle comes to a shaky stop.   

             KYLE
    I know you would.  Do it for me.

Henry helps Kyle to a chair.  Leaves them alone.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    Ive been a shitty friend to you.

             SAM
    No--



                                     68.
             KYLE
    You were right.  Shes broken up with 
    me seven times since the ninth grade.  
    Now I think I understand why.

             SAM
    Wait.  What are you saying?

KYLES HOSPITAL ROOM - THAT NIGHT

Kyle leans against the window frame, looking out. 

             KYLE
    Dream tonight.

He hobbles to the bed.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    Dream of Marley.  Dream.

EXT. POND

Kyle reels, then realizes where he is.  Marleys beside him.

She starts to speak - he stops her.

             KYLE
    I love you.  I didnt know how much 
    until I thought Id lost you.

             MARLEY
    Ive always been right here.

And like an whispered echo, he hears it again:

             VOICE
	(V.O.)
    ...been right here.

Kyle looks around for the source.  He and Marley are alone.  
But, by the lake: a SHADOW sits.  A silhouette.  What?

             KYLE
    Marley.  Youre not real.

             MARLEY
    Im as real as she is.  Feel this?

She traces his lips.

             MARLEY
	(CONTD)
    What about this?

Marley kisses him.  His eyes close.  He pulls back.


                                     69.
             KYLE
    Everyone, theyre telling me--

             MARLEY
    Dont listen to them, Kyle.

CUT TO: HOSPITAL ROOM

             MARLEY
	(V.O.)
    Listen to me.

Kyle jerks awake.  Looks around.  No one.

His head falls against the pillow.  Defeated.  

He rubs his hands over his face.  Sucks in a deep breath...

Wait. Theres something.  A scent.  

He breathes in again.  Nothing. 

Straightens his blanket and catches the smell again.

The blanket.  He pulls it to his nose.  That smell.  It could 
only be one thing.  Somehow.  Some way.

She was here.

             KYLE
    Marley.


EXT. HOSPITAL COURTYARD - NEXT DAY

Sam pushes Kyle down a cement path.  

             SAM
    Now youre just making shit up.

             KYLE
    Shes real.  I dont care if no one 
    believes me.

             SAM
    Well, thats something you can count 
    on.  No ones going to believe you.

INT. KYLES HOSPITAL ROOM

Benefield reads Kyles chart.  Kyle talks rapid-fire.

             KYLE
    And my blanket, it smelled like her.

Benefield reaches for the MORPHINE PUMP.


             DR. BENEFIELD    Im going to lower this dosage.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER THAT DAY

Kyle cringes as Kimberly fumes.

                                     70.

             KIMBERLY
    Another girl.  From your coma.  How 
    stupid do I look?  You push me away 
    and when you finally decide to tell 
    me why... its because of a dream!?  

             KYLE
    I wanted you to know that it has 
    nothing to do with you.  

             KIMBERLY
    It has everything to do with me.  Im 
    not your dream girl. Got it.

             KYLE
    I know it sounds crazy--

             KIMBERLY
    Sounds crazy?  That broken leg is the 
    least of your problems.

             KYLE
    Kim, stop.  Why are you so angry?  
    You dont even love me.

That stops her cold.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    Thats okay, I dont love you either.

             KIMBERLY
    Goodbye, Kyle.  Have a nice imaginary 
    life.  With your coma girl. 

She storms out.  Sam peeks in from outside the door.

             SAM
    Ouch.

             KYLE
    How much did you hear?

             SAM
    Sorry.

             KYLE
    Think we could smuggle in some beer?


                                     71.
             SAM
    And have Doc break your other leg?  
           (beat)
    You think shell be okay?  Kim?

             KYLE
    Yeah.  But maybe you should call her.

Sam doesnt want to betray his friend...  

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    Weve talked about this.  Call.  Her.

INT. THERAPY ROOM - NEXT DAY

Kyle struggles through therapy.  Benefield and Henry watch.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Unclog your damned ears for a minute, 
    all Im saying is--

             KYLE
    I heard what you said about science, 
    seeing things with your own eyes.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Its not only that, Kyle.  Youre 
    choosing to believe something so... 

Kyle stumbles.  Henry moves to him, braces his legs.

             HENRY
    Five more, youre done.

Kyles leg trembles.  He takes the step.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    I just dont want you to expect--

             KYLE
    Not listening. 

His leg starts to buckle.  He tries to hold on.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    Cant.  I cant do anymore.

Benefield steps in front of him.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Come on.  Youre tougher than this.

But he crumples.  Benefield helps him to the floor.  Kyle 
turns from her, his face empty.  Beaten.


                                     72.
             DR. BENEFIELD
	(CONTD)
    Henry, bring us some water, please.
           (to Kyle)
    Hey.  Hey, look here.

Kyle clenches his jaw, keeps his head turned away.

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(CONTD)
    Kyle.  Whats going on?  

             KYLE
    My wife.  My kids.  I miss them. 

Benefield takes a beat.  Makes a decision.  Shit.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Fine.  Youve convinced me.

             KYLE
    Yeah right.


             DR. BENEFIELD 
    I believe you.  Against everything I 
    know to be true, I believe you.  

             KYLE
    Stop.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Ill prove it.  Ill do whatever I 
    can to help you find her.  But only 
    if you help yourself.  Five more.

Kyle takes a beat.  Then he hefts himself up.  Resolved.

Benefield backs away.

Henrys at the door with the water.  She gestures him over.  
Kyle works through his steps, dogged.

             HENRY
           (whispers to Benefield)
    You dont really believe him?

             DR. BENEFIELD
    No.  But I need him to believe it.

Kyle looks to them, a grin on his sweaty face.

INT. KYLES HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER

Kyle has the iPad on his lap, Internet White Pages on the 
screen.  Benefield stands beside the bed.


                                     73.
He jots one more name to a LIST hes making.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Never been on a wild goose chase.  

             KYLE
    Deals a deal.

He gives her the list.  She tucks it into her pocket, gestures 
to a wheelchair.

THERAPY ROOM

Step after step, Kyle makes his way across the room.  Still on 
the support bars.  Real close to giving up.  

Benefield watches from the doorway. 

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Where did we leave off?  The duck 
    pond, wasnt it?

             KYLE
           (exhausted)
    Her very favorite place.  Said she 
    always felt happy there.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Tell me more.

             KYLE
    The birds.  She loved those birds.

His spine straightens, he moves more determinedly.  

Benefield sees it.

INT. KYLES HOSPITAL ROOM - A FEW DAYS LATER

Benefield gives Kyle back his LIST - dozens of names crossed 
out.  Each name is PHELPS, from Amelia to Luther.

Written in the margin: wrong number, disconnected, wrong 
number, no kids.

             KYLE
    You called all of them?

             DR. BENEFIELD 
    It was a thrilling Saturday night.  
    What about you?

Kyle shows her his list, M through Z.  No luck.


                                     74.
KYLES HOSPITAL ROOM - NEXT DAY

iPad in front of him, Kyle searches the Net.  Nothing. 

He sighs, puts down the iPad. 

KYLES HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Kyle teeters beside his bed.  Alone.  Releases the bed rails.  

Stands for a moment.  His right leg crumples.

             KYLE
    Ow.  Shit.


LATER

A nurse checks Kyles morphine drip.  His shoulders drop.

Its no damn use.

INT. KYLES HOSPITAL ROOM - NEXT MORNING

Benefield shines a light into one of Kyles eyes.

             DR. BENEFIELD 
    Dont pull another stunt like that.

             KYLE
    Am I ever going to walk again?  Level 
    with me.

Hes discouraged.  She changes the subject.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    I keep thinking about Marley and that 
    flower made of pills.

             KYLE
    Yeah?  It was the weirdest thing.  I 
    was glad you were at the hospital 
    that day.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    I dont know why.  Im no 
    psychiatrist, and you certainly--

             KYLE
    --dont want a neurosurgeon telling 
    you how to think.  

Benefields surprised.  Took the words right out of her mouth.  


                                     75.
             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    Thats what you said then, too.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - A FEW DAYS LATER

Kyles propped on crutches, Benefield next to him.

             DR. BENEFIELD 
    You sure youre ready for this?

             KYLE
    She needs me.

             DR. BENEFIELD
           (beat)
    One time around the nurses desk.  
    Thats all.

Lydia rounds the corner, stops in her tracks.

             LYDIA
    Youre walking.

             DR. BENEFIELD 
    Three weeks before schedule.

             LYDIA
    Thats great, sweetheart.  

A hug.

             LYDIA
	(CONTD)
    Excuse us for a minute, honey.  I 
    need to speak with Dr. Benefield.

             KYLE
    About what?


             LYDIA
    About getting the house ready for you 
    to come home.

Benefield brings over a nurse.

             DR. BENEFIELD 
           (to nurse)
    One time around.

The nurse leads Kyle away.

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(CONTD)
    Hes been working very hard.


                                     76.
             LYDIA
    How dare you encourage these 
    fantasies of his?  He has a life 
    waiting for him outside this place, 
    or didnt you remember that?

             DR. BENEFIELD
           (whoa)
    Im doing what it takes to keep him 
    motivated.

             LYDIA
    Why dont you take him on a trip to 
    Oz while youre at it? 

             DR. BENEFIELD
    You want him better, dont you?  Hes 
    walking weeks before he should.

             LYDIA
    Of course I want him better.  But I 
    dont want him thinking he gets to 
    leave here and play house with some 
    imaginary wife.

Kyle shuffles up to them.

             KYLE
    You two look serious.

             LYDIA
    Just chatting.

Kyle doesnt believe that for a second.

             DR. BENEFIELD
           (to Kyle)
    Ill see you tomorrow.

She leaves.  Lydia helps her son to his room.

KYLES HOSPITAL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

             LYDIA
    Kims on her way over.

             KYLE
    Mom.  You have to stop meddling.

             LYDIA
    I know you two can work through this. 

Kyle makes his way to the bed, sits.


                                     77.
             KYLE
    You need to trust me to take care of 
    myself.  Kim, Sam, and I, were 
    adults.  We can handle a little 
    conflict.

She looks at him for a beat.

             LYDIA
    When did you get to be so grown-up?

Kimberly steps in.

             KYLE
    Hey.

             KIMBERLY
    Hey. 

             LYDIA
           (beat)
    Okay, then.

She leaves, Kim sits in the chair.  After an awkward silence:

             KIMBERLY
    Ive been thinking about what you 
    said, really thinking about it.

             KYLE
    So have I.


             KIMBERLY
    I love you, I do, but...

She trails off.

             KYLE
    You dont know how long Ive waited 
    to hear this.  But what?

No answer.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    But... Sam.

             KIMBERLY
    What?


Kyle just gives her a knowing look.

             KIMBERLY
	(CONTD)
           (beat)
    Nothings happened.


                                     78.
             KYLE
    Maybe something should.

             KIMBERLY
    Kyle, if this about that night--

             KYLE
    Ive had a lot of time to think about 
    that night.  A lot of time, Kim.  I 
    was angry.  Selfish.  I should have 
    listened to you.  You were right. 
           (beat)
    Kim, youre my best friend.  I love 
    you, too... but.

             KIMBERLY
           (starts to cry)
    Thats what we are, isnt it?  We are
    best friends.
           (beat)
    Im sorry.

             KYLE
    Theres nothing to be sorry for.

A nice silence.  Then:

             KIMBERLY
    Youre so different, after... I cant 
    explain it.  But its nice.

             KYLE
    So.  You gonna call him?

             KIMBERLY
    I am not talking about Sam with you.  
    Not yet.  Besides, Im ready to hear 
    about this angel of yours.

LATER

Kimberly takes it all in.

             KIMBERLY
    Wow.  Thats-- are you sure?

             KYLE
    Yeah.  Im sure.

             KIMBERLY
    Im just scared that youve--


                                     79.
             KYLE
    Gone mental?
           (beat)
    I know Im right.  Shes out there.  
    Im going to find her.

             KIMBERLY
    Well, I know better than to try and 
    talk you out of something you want.

Kimberly hugs him goodbye.

             KIMBERLY
	(CONTD)
    Good night, Kyle.  Sweet dreams.

She leaves.  

Kyle squints, rubs his temples.  He buzzes the nurses station.

             KYLE
    Can I get some Tylenol, please?

LATER THAT NIGHT

Kyle sleeps.  Fitful.

FLASH

Whimpers.  Pitiful, heartbreaking sounds.  

Kyle follows the noises.  

Out his hospital room.  Down the hall.  

Through a door... into his daughters room.

GIRLS ROOM

Marley and her girls cower in a corner, cling to each other.

             MARLEY
    Theyll find me in a minute. 

Her hair hangs in limp strands.  Eyes sunken, hollow.

He hesitates, then gathers his family close.

             MARLEY
	(CONTD)
    I cant stay.  I want to but I dont 
    know how.
           (beat)
    Please, dont leave me here.


                                     80.
The girls have stopped crying.  Theyve stopped... moving.  He 
looks at them.  Theyre dolls.  Ragged baby dolls.

What?  He looks around.  Behind him:

The hospital.  Benefield.  A nurse with a syringe.

Marley grips his arm.  He turns to her.  Theyre back in the 
girls room.

             MARLEY
	(CONTD)
    Dont leave me.

             KYLE
    Where are you?

             MARLEY
    Kyle.

             KYLE
    Marley, where are you?

CUT TO: KYLES HOSPITAL ROOM

Kyle wakes.  My God.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

Kyle hobbles down the empty hall, on a mission.  Passes 
through some double doors.  A CHARGE NURSE rounds the corner.

             KYLE
    I need Dr. Benefield.  Can you find 
    her for me?

             CHARGE NURSE
    This is Critical Care.  Youre not 
    supposed to be in here.

At the far end of the hall, doors swing open.  Benefield with 
another DOCTOR.  He puts a hand on her shoulder.

             DOCTOR
    You tried, Tory.  You couldnt have 
    done anything more than you did.

Benefield shrugs off his hand.  He leaves her alone.  

She stares at her SCRUB CAP, speckled with blood.

Kyle makes his way to her.

             KYLE
    I need your help.


Shes not happy to see him.
                                     81.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    Its Marley.  Shes in trouble.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    I dont want to hear another word 
    about Marley.  Its time for you to 
    let this go.

             KYLE
    I knew it.  You lied.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    I just lost a patient.  I wish I 
    could dream that away, but I cant.

She walks away, he struggles to follow.

             KYLE
    Wait!

             DR. BENEFIELD
    We can continue this discussion if 
    you can keep up with me.

He limps in earnest.  It gets harder and harder, but he goes 
all out - and collapses about ten steps in.

Benefield catches the arm of a passing INTERN.

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(CONTD)
    Get him on a stretcher and back to 
    room four-seventeen.

She walks away.

HOSPITAL - WOMENS LOCKER ROOM - MINUTES LATER

Benefields now in street clothes.  She slams a LOCKER.  Picks 
up her bag, heads out.

KYLES HOSPITAL ROOM

The intern helps Kyle into bed.  He collapses onto his pillow.

A NURSE enters, re-attaches Kyles I.V. line.

             NURSE
    Always an adventure with you, Mr. 
    Lafferty.  Here, Ill bump your 
    morphine a bit.  Help you sleep.

She adjusts the drip rate, leaves.


                                     82.
Kyle stairs at the ceiling.  Waitaminute.  He turns to the 
MORPHINE INFUSION PUMP.

He thinks, reaches over and presses the STOP button.  BEEP.

HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

Benefield walks down the hall, empty at this hour.

She pushes through some double-doors, takes a left.  Another 
left.  Stops at an elevator: OUT OF ORDER

             DR. BENEFIELD 
    Perfect.


She starts to head back.  Catches a glimpse of SOMEONE 
skirting around a corner.  She stops.  Takes a second look.

Nothing.

She starts walking again.

Waitasec. A WHISPER of sound.  She stops again, tries to 
hear.  There.  Faint.  Sing-songy.

KYLES HOSPITAL ROOM - SAME TIME

Kyle sleeps.  A SHADOW leans in.  FINGERS trace his lips.

HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

Benefield glances down at her watch.  2:36 AM.  

She hears the PLUNKS of someone walking on stairs.  

She opens a door.  The feet are heading down.  Toward her.

KYLES HOSPITAL ROOM

A dainty HAND lays a gentle palm against Kyles cheek.

STAIRWELL

The footsteps are close.  Benefield looks up...

Its a JANITOR.  He goes past her, carrying a CLEAR TRASH BAG 
filled with STARGAZER LILIES.

Benefield cant take her eyes off them.  

He goes through the stairwell door.  BAM - the door slams.

Silence.  Then, a far-off voice calls:


                                     83.
             FAR-OFF VOICE
	(O.S.)
    Marley.


Benefield strains to hear it.

             FAR-OFF VOICE
	(O.S.)
	(CONTD)
    Come on, now.

Did she just hear... ? She waits, listens.  Nothing.

             DR. BENEFIELD 
    Okay, dont be stupid.

She opens the stairwell door.  But it drifts to her again:

             FAR-OFF VOICE
	(O.S.)
    Marley.  


That IS what she heard. She bounds up the stairs.

KYLES HOSPITAL ROOM

The hand hovers just over Kyles chest, settles at his heart.

STAIRWELL

Benefield stops.  Listens.

             VOICE
	(O.S.)
    Marley!  


Definitely louder.  She grabs the door, it doesnt budge.  A 
sign: FIFTH FLOOR - PSYCHIATRIC WARD

She touches her badge to a KEY-CARD READER.  BEEP.  Shes in.

KYLES HOSPITAL ROOM

Kyles in REM sleep.  Eyelids flutter.

CUT TO: KYLE AND MARLEYS BEDROOM 

He stretches.  Rolls over.  Opens his eyes.  

Marley, mid 40s, comes in from the bathroom in a YELLOW ROBE.

             MARLEY
    Its quiet here with the girls gone.  

She slides onto the bed.  Curls up against him.  

             KYLE
    Please tell me this is real.


                                     84.
             MARLEY
    Its real, all right.  Our little 
    birds have flown the coop. 

             KYLE
    Are we really here?

             MARLEY
    What?  Did you drink wine again?

             KYLE
    Marley.

             MARLEY
    Yes?

             KYLE
    Keep talking.

INT. HOSPITAL - NURSES STATION

Benefield reaches the station, hands her badge to the PSYCH 
WARD NURSE.

             DR. BENEFIELD 
    Youre going to think Im nuts, but-- 

That gets her a stern look.

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(CONTD)
    Sorry.  

           (beat)
    I overheard someone yelling.  

             PSYCH WARD NURSE 1 
    People in this ward do tend to yell, 
    Doctor.

Another nurse comes over with a WATERING CAN.

             PSYCH WARD NURSE 1
	(CONTD)
           (to the nurse)
    Any sign of her?

             PSYCH WARD NURSE 2
           (re: watering can)
    I found this in the west stairwell.

INT. KYLE AND MARLEYS BEDROOM

             MARLEY
    Sarah called.  Shes met some boy.  
    Wants to bring him to dinner.


                                     85.
             KYLE
    Hey, whens the last time I told you 
    that I love you?

             MARLEY
    The last time you saw me.

INT. NURSES STATION

Benefield nods to the watering can.

             DR. BENEFIELD 
    Is that who youre looking for?

             PSYCH WARD NURSE 2
    She's probably just snuck down to the 
    childrens unit to watch them sleep.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    You let her roam?

             PSYCH WARD NURSE 1
    Shes not dangerous.  Shes been here 
    practically her whole life.  Marleys 
    a sweet girl.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Marley... Phelps?

             PSYCH WARD NURSE 1
    Thats right.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Marley Phelps is in this ward?

INT. KYLE AND MARLEYS BEDROOM

Kyle strokes the hair from Marleys face.  Studies her.

             MARLEY
    What are you doing?

             KYLE
    Memorizing your face.  Im afraid 
    that Im going to wake up and you 
    wont be here.

             MARLEY
    No.  Talk about happy things.

INT. PSYCH WARD - MARLEYS ROOM

Benefield steps through the door.


The walls are covered with HAND-DRAWN PICTURES.  Exquisite.
The artist is talented.  Faces captured in startling detail.

Every one of them is of Kyle and Marley.  Sometimes children 
are included - two girls.  Scenes from their life together. 

                                     86.

             PSYCH WARD NURSE 2
    We didnt even know she could draw.  
    She just started working on those 
    about two months ago.  

             DR. BENEFIELD
           (beat)
    Eight weeks.

             PSYCH WARD NURSE 2
    Then three weeks ago she crashed.  We 
    dont know what happened.

But for Benefield, the drawings tell the tale.  One of them is 
of Marley in the rocking chair with baby Elizabeth.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Remarkable.


Benefield goes to the small WRITING TABLE.  

On it, a JOURNAL lies open.  Neat handwriting fills each line.  
She looks up from the desk.

And thats when she sees it, out the window:

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(CONTD)
    The new neurosurgery wing.

             PSYCH WARD NURSE 2
    Once they broke ground we couldn't 
    tear her away from this window.  Now 
    she sits all day, watching people 
    come in and out of the rooms.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    And at night...

Benefields eyes scan the building across from them.  There:

Marleys window looks directly down into Kyles room.

Its dark, but a young woman is visible, sitting in Kyles 
bedside chair, head resting on his chest.

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(CONTD)
    I think I found your girl.


EXT. DUCK POND
Kyle and Marley walk hand-in-hand beside the water.

                                     87.

             MARLEY
    You mean were just going to rattle 
    around that big house all alone?

             KYLE
    Well occupy ourselves somehow.

             MARLEY
    Im happy to be alone with you.

             KYLE
    Me, too.  

             MARLEY
           (beat)
    Lets get a dog.

Right then, a huge GREAT DANE bounds up to them.  WOOF!

INT. KYLES HOSPITAL ROOM

The MORPHINE INFUSION PUMP blinks OFF.

And Kyle opens his eyes.  

HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

Benefield, the Psych Ward Nurse, and two orderlies hurry 
toward Kyles room.

KYLES HOSPITAL ROOM

Marley hasnt noticed that Kyles awake.

He stays still and listens to her speak.  

No longer a part of the story.

             MARLEY
           (whispers)
    A Great Dane.  Ive always wanted a 
    big dog.  And hes sweet, too.

Shes smaller than she was in the dream, more frail.  Lank 
hair.  Pale, almost translucent skin.

HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

Benefield and the staff round a corner.


                                     88.
             PSYCH WARD NURSE 2 
    I hope he doesnt try to interact 
    with her.

             DR. BENEFIELD 
    Why?


             PSYCH WARD NURSE 2 
    She cant take direct contact.  Its 
    one of her triggers.

Benefield breaks into a run.

KYLES HOSPITAL ROOM

             MARLEY
           (whispers)
    Lets name him Howard, okay?
           (excited)
    Oh.  We should play in the rain.  
    Make it rain, Kyle.
           (beat)
    Hello... Earth to Kyle...

CUT TO: DUCK POND

The Great Dane gallops up to Marley with a STICK in his mouth.

But Marleys looking at Kyle, standing still next to her, like 
a frozen-in-time mannequin.

             MARLEY
    Why are you just standing there?

Then suddenly: he vanishes.

INT. KYLES HOSPITAL ROOM

A tear rolls down Kyles cheek.  Marleys still whispering:

             MARLEY
    Where did you go?  Youre supposed to 
    make it rain and say...

             KYLE
    I love you.


She stiffens.  Shes frozen, like an animal trapped by its 
predator, just waiting for the attack.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    Marley?  Baby?  Its me.

She pulls her head from his chest and creeps away from him.


                                     89.
             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    Its me.  Kyle.

She trembles, her eyes are blank, staring off into a world he 
can no longer see.

Kyle sits up, and Marley darts out of the room...

HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

...right into the arms of the orderlies.  She struggles.  They 
immediately let her go.  

She scuttles to the end of the hallway, cowers in a corner.

Kyle stumbles to the doorway.

             KYLE
    Marley!


Then Benefields there, in front of him.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Dont.


             KYLE
    Whats wrong with her?

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Wait.  Just wait.

The orderlies and the Psych Ward Nurse inch toward Marley.  

She whimpers.  They turn their eyes away, dont look directly 
at her.  Marley grunts, tugs at her hair.  

The nurse approaches.  Slow, eyes down. 

             PSYCH WARD NURSE 2
    My goodness, Marley.  Youre a long 
    way from home.  Did you find some 
    thirsty plants over here?

Marley peeks at her.  Thinks about that.  Nods.

             PSYCH WARD NURSE 2
	(CONTD)
    Did you give them all their water?

Another nod.

             PSYCH WARD NURSE 2
	(CONTD)
    What a good girl.  
           (beat)
    Im sleepy.  How about you?


                                     90.
Benefield watches, fascinated.  Kyle struggles to understand.

Eyes still turned away, the nurse holds out her hand.  Marley 
inches toward it.

Shes about to take the hand but pulls back a little.  

Then, she touches a finger to the nurses palm.  Does it 
again, as if testing to see if the fingers will capture her.  

The nurse holds her hand perfectly still.  Marley cautiously 
places her fingers against the palm.

The nurses fingers close, slowly, around Marleys hand.

             PSYCH WARD NURSE 2
	(CONTD)
    Bedtime.  Okay?

Nurse and Marley walk away, hand in hand.  Kyle can't tear his 
eyes away.  He remembers.

FLASHBACK - TRAUMA UNIT

The FLASH of overhead fluorescents.

At a care station, a DOCTOR with a crying CHILD...

More lights overhead.  FLASH.  FLASH.

An ELDERLY WOMAN getting oxygen...

FLASH.  FLASH.

A NURSE - the same Psych Ward Nurse - bandages a YOUNG WOMANs 
forehead.  The nurse moves aside and we see the patients 
face.  Its Marley.

Her eyes lift, lock onto Kyle's...

END FLASHBACK

             KYLE
           (to Benefield)
    Its her.

EXT. HOSPITAL COURTYARD - NEXT DAY

Kyle and Sam sit on a bench, some crutches next to Kyle.  He 
stares up at MARLEYS WINDOW.

             SAM
    I should have believed you.  Kimberly 
    says Marleys... sick.


                                     91.
             KYLE
    Doc says its a broad spectrum de-
    personalization disorder.  Soli-- 
    solipsism syndrome.

             SAM
    Oh yeah.  That.  Sure.

             KYLE
    For Marley, the world is in her head.  
    She believes everything she sees is 
    only in her imagination.  She lives 
    in her own story.

             SAM
    So, she was telling you a story.

             KYLE
           (turns to Sam)
    When I woke up last night and she was 
    there - she was waiting for me.

             SAM
    Waiting?


             KYLE
    Waiting for me to add to it.  Thats 
    what Ive been doing all along.  It 
    wasnt a story.  It was our story.

             SAM
    Dude.  Thats not possible.  You were 
    in a coma.

Kyles eyes go back to Marleys window.

             KYLE
    I know I can reach her.  Im the only 
    one who can.  

INT. PSYCH WARD - DAY

Benefield and Kyle, on crutches, head through the halls. 

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Youre absolutely not supposed to be 
    here, but I wanted you to see this.  
    Shes still in the rec room, so we 
    have maybe fifteen minutes.

             KYLE
    I need to see her.  I scared her the 
    last time - she didnt know I was 
    going to wake up.


                                     92.
             DR. BENEFIELD
    She isnt the Marley you loved, Kyle.

             KYLE
    But if I could just--

             DR. BENEFIELD
    I said no.  You promised you wouldnt 
    do this if I brought you here.
           (beat)
    Im going to show you her room.  In 
    and out.  Otherwise, we leave now.

             KYLE
    Okay.  I want to see it. 

INT. MARLEYS ROOM

Kyle takes it all in.  He walks the perimeter of the room, 
fingers tracing Marleys face in each drawing.

             KYLE
    Its all here.  Every moment we spent 
    together.

             DR. BENEFIELD 
    She told you all these things.  Its 
    no surprise you recognize them.

Kyle takes a look around.  Maybe the docs right.

He turns to leave...

...when one drawing catches his eye.

Its of a DISCO BALL, hanging from a rearview mirror.

He unpins the paper from the wall.

             KYLE
    This.  This was the last thing I saw 
    before the crash.  I told her this.

Another drawing: a large oak, initials carved in the bark.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    My third grade crush.  I carved her 
    initials.  I told Marley about her.

And another - a shaggy pup, tongue wagging.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    Rufus.  My first dog.


                                     93.
He hands Benefield the disco ball drawing.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    Only one way she could have known to 
    draw these things.  We were together.

VOICES approach from outside the room.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Time to go.


PSYCH WARD

Kyle follows Benefield.

One of the orderlies from the previous night turns a corner, 
heads toward them.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Shit.


Benefield pushes Kyle back around the corner.

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(CONTD)
    Dont let him see you.

She steps back into the hall.

             ORDERLY
	(O.S.)
    Hey, Doc.  Come to see our Marley?

As Kyle waits, he sees a SIGN: an arrow points in the 
direction of the RECREATION ROOM.

Benefield and the orderly walk past.

Kyle waits another beat, then slips down the corridor.

OUTSIDE REC ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

He looks through the window and there she is.  

Marley.  Alone in a corner.  Holding TWO BABY DOLLS.

REC ROOM

Kyle makes his way to Marley.  Hes surprisingly fast, urgency 
pushing his bad leg forward.

The other PATIENTS ignore him, WARD NURSES chat in a corner.

Kyle kneels in front of Marley.  Takes her hand.


                                     94.
             KYLE
    Marley?  


He pulls from her mouth the hair shes been chewing on.

PSYCH WARD

Benefield returns.  No Kyle.  Sees the rec room SIGN.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Damn it.  Damn it!

REC ROOM

Marleys eyes swim into focus... and focus on Kyle.  

And for one moment they are together.  Eyes locked in love.

Marleys hand lifts.  But then her eyes cloud over and shes 
pulled back into herself.  She cowers.

Kyle reaches for her.

             KYLE
    Marley, dont be afraid.  Its me.

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(O.S.)
    Kyle, no!


He pulls Marley to him.  A tortured HOWL rips from her throat.  

Kyle reacts by hugging her tight.  But Marleys howl only 
grows louder.  Pure torment.  She THRASHES in his arms.

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(CONTD)
    Kyle, let her go.  Kyle!

Kyle relaxes his hold, Marley breaks free.  She runs to a 
wall... and BASHES her head against it.  Again.  Again.

Again.  BLOOD smears the plaster.  

             KYLE
    Marley!


Pandemonium.  Nurses race over.

Kyle tries to get to Marley, but rowdy PATIENTS block his way.  
They shout, throw books and chairs.

The nurses get through the crowd, try to restrain Marley.  She 
screams and claws, her head bleeding badly.


                                     95.
Finally her voice starts to give out.  Her eyes roll back.  
And she goes limp.

Two beefy ORDERLIES drag Kyle away.  

INT. OFFICE OF THE HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATOR - AN HOUR LATER

Benefield paces.

DR. PIERCE (60s), enters.  Slams the door behind him.

             DR. PIERCE
    You have placed me and this hospital, 
    in an impossible position.  Thanks to 
    you, we now have seven patients who 
    had to be forcibly restrained, four 
    with broken bones, three who needed 
    sutures.  What were you thinking, 
    Tory?  This isnt like you.  Tell me 
    what Im supposed to do here.

A KNOCK on the door.

             NURSE
    Doctor, you wanted me to let you know-

             DR. PIERCE
    Thank you, Anna.  Tory, lets go.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Where?

             DR. PIERCE
    To try and clean up some of this mess 
    youve made.

KYLES HOSPITAL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Pierce stops in the doorway, motions Benefield to enter.

Kyles in bed.  In RESTRAINTS.

             KYLE
    Doc, get me out of these.

Benefields barely in the room when she turns on Pierce.

             DR. BENEFIELD
           (fierce whisper)
    Restraints?  Is that necessary?

             DR. PIERCE
    They wouldnt be needed if you had 
    properly controlled your patient.


                                     96.
             DR. BENEFIELD
    This is not--

             DR. PIERCE
    Im in charge now.  The message to 
    that young man is this: you and I, 
    were on the same page.  You stand 
    with me, or youre fired.

He steps past her, into the room.

             DR. PIERCE
	(CONTD)
    Mr. Lafferty.  I am Dr. Weldon 
    Pierce, chief administrator of this 
    hospital.  Dr. Benefield is no longer 
    the physician in charge of your care.

             KYLE
    What?

             DR. PIERCE
    You and your doctor have been 
    involved in an incident that has left 
    another patient of this hospital in 
    critical condition.

             KYLE
    Marley.

           (to Benefield)
    How bad is it?

Benefield cant look at him.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    How bad?


She shakes her head, stares at the floor.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    Marleys... dying?
           (beat)
    How long?

             DR. PIERCE
    Few hours.  Maybe less.

Kyle FIGHTS against the restraints.

             KYLE
    Take me to her.  Ive got to see her.

             DR. PIERCE
    There will be no more of that.  Dr. 
    Benefield, youre done for the day.  


                                     97.
             DR. PIERCE
	(CONT'D)
    Go home.  Mr. Lafferty, you consider 
    getting yourself an attorney.

HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

             DR. BENEFIELD 
    What the hell was that?

             DR. PIERCE
    That was exactly what you would have 
    done eight weeks ago.  Walk away from 
    that boy and never look back.

He leaves her.  Shes still within earshot of Kyle.

             KYLE
	(O.S.)
    Please.  I promised her.  No more sad 
    stories.  I promised.

Benefield wavers.  Then steels herself and walks away.

WOMENS LOCKER ROOM - MINUTES LATER

Benefield sits on a bench.  Stares at the WALL CLOCK.

TICK.  TICK.  TICK.  TICK.

She pulls her eyes away, opens her locker.  Her hospital ID 
BADGE hangs inside, mocking her.  She reaches for her jacket.

Another look at the clock.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Do you believe in love...

Fuck it.  She grabs her badge.

KYLES HOSPITAL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Kyles still in restraints.  Tears track his cheeks.

The door opens.  He doesnt bother to look up.

             KYLE
    What do you want?

             DR. BENEFIELD 
    We dont have much time.

HALLWAY OUTSIDE PYSCH WARD - MOMENTS LATER

Two ORDERLIES block Kyles entrance into the ward.


Through the double-doors, Benefield ARGUES with a third ORDERLY and the Psych Ward Nurse.

It gets heated.  Benefield comes back through the doors.

                                     98.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Pierce put them on alert.

             KYLE
    Im not leaving.  Not til I see her.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Shes non-responsive.  She wont even 
    know youre here, Kyle.  

             KYLE
    Why isnt she in the ICU?

Benefield says nothing.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    You mean theyre not even going to 
    try to save her?  Theyre just going 
    to let her die?

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Thats all they can do.  
           (beat)
    Its her familys wishes that she be 
    as comfortable as possible.

             KYLE
    Family?


Just then a WOMAN comes out of Marleys room.  Older, still 
quite beautiful.  She has Marleys hair, her eyes.    

This can only be: ELIZABETH PHELPS.  Marleys mother.

The nurse says something to her, points toward Kyle.

Elizabeths eyes meet Kyles.  She pushes through the doors...

...and SLAPS Kyle hard.

             ELIZABETH
    You.  It was you.

Another SLAP.  Kyle takes it.  Elizabeth pulls at his shirt.

             ELIZABETH
	(CONTD)
    Why?  You son of a bitch.  Why did 
    you have to touch her?


                                     99.
             KYLE
    Marleys the world to me.

             ELIZABETH
    Dont you say her name.  

             KYLE
    Please, just wait.  Let me explain--

             ELIZABETH
    How you killed my daughter?  How you 
    took from me the only thing left that 
    I care about?

             KYLE
    Marleys the only thing I care about.  
    Shes my wife.

Elizabeth backs away, turns to the orderlies.

             ELIZABETH
    This man is crazy.  Keep him far away 
    from this room.  
           (to Kyle)
    You stay away from my daughter. 

She stalks away.

             KYLE
    I know what happened to Laura.

This stops her cold.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    I know everything.  Marley told me.

             ELIZABETH
    Youre lying.  Marley never speaks.

She opens the hallway door, but...

             KYLE
    When Marley was nine, her hermit crab 
    fell into the heating vent.  She 
    cried for weeks.

Elizabeth freezes.  How?

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    When Lauras baby teeth fell out 
    before Marleys, Marley pulled out 
    her own front teeth.  Thats the 
    first time you took her to a 
    psychiatrist.  


                                     100.
Oh, my God. She turns to him.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    I know that you sang Twinkle Twinkle 
    Little Star to them every night.  You 
    sang all the verses.  Marleys the 
    only person Ive ever known who can 
    sing every word of that song.  
    Because you taught it to her.

             ELIZABETH
    Marley doesnt talk.  To anyone.

             KYLE
    She talks to me.

He looks to Benefield.  She nods.  Go on.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    Elsewhere, in another time or place 
    or... existence, Marley is my wife.  
    I need to be with her.  I cant let 
    her do this alone.  Please.

MARLEYS ROOM

Kyle moves to the bed.  Marleys on her back, head bandaged.

He forces his bad leg to bend, sits beside her.

Elizabeth, Benefield, the Psych Ward Nurse and the Orderly are 
all there.   

             KYLE
           (to Benefield)
    Will I hurt her?

             DR. BENEFIELD 
    No.  You wont hurt her.

Kyle slides his arms beneath Marley and carefully pulls her up 
against his chest.

His eyes track the room, the drawings.  Their life together.

He closes his eyes.  Leans down to Marley.

             KYLE
    Marley?  Im here.

A beat.  Nothing.  Tries again.


                                     101.
             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    I dont know how to do this.  Come on 
    baby, help me.

Another long beat.  Then, suddenly, the world tilts...

CUT TO: KYLE AND MARLEYS HOUSE

Kyle opens his eyes.  Yes!

The house is empty, no furniture, nothing.  Except some PAGES 
scattered around the living room.

             KYLE
    Marley!


Kyle runs into the kitchen... up the stairs... the bathroom... 
the bedrooms...

Nothing.  No one.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    Marley!


CUT TO: MARLEYS ROOM

Kyles back in the hospital.  Frustrated.

             KYLE
    I cant find her.  I dont know how.

He looks to Benefield.  Shes sympathetic but has no answers. 

His eyes go back to the drawings.

And thats when he sees it, stuck down in a corner of the 
wall, nearly hidden by the others.

Scribbled blackness, covering an illustration.

Oh no. He turns back to Marley.  His eyes close, focuses...

CUT TO: KYLE AND MARLEYS HOUSE

Hes back in the empty house.

Those papers on the living room floor.  Kyle grabs one, turns 
it over.  Its scribbled black.  Flips another: all black.

FLASHBACK - GIRLS ROOM

Elizabeth reads from a book, flips past a black page.


                                     102.
             KYLE
    Wait.  That page.  Turn back.

She does.  Its an illustration of the duck pond.

END FLASHBACK

Kyle looks at the blacked-out paper in his hand.

             KYLE
    Thats where you are.

He rushes to the door.  Opens it.

Inky BLACKNESS grips the house.  No light, no sound.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    Marley?


EXT. HOUSE

Kyle steps onto the dark lawn.  A chill WIND picks up.

             KYLE
    Light.  Give me light.

Nothing.  He takes a step, blindly feels his way.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    Give me light, damn it!

Kyles got his arms out, searching.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    How did you do this, Marley?

It hits him.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
           (to himself)
    The story.  Tell the story.
           (out loud)
    He... sees a light?

In the distance: a LIGHT.  Yes! But its too far, too faint.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    The light becomes brighter.  

The glow shimmers, expands... 

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    It leads him... to her.


                                     103.
From the light, a warm burst rushes along the ground, toward 
him, making a luminous PATH that stops at his feet.

He takes a step onto the glowing trail.  Then runs.

EXT. POND - LATER

The paths taken Kyle to the park.  He jogs around the pond.  
Stops.  Catches his breath.  Darkness is pushing in.

             KYLE
    Marley.  Where are you?

He closes his eyes.  Concentrates.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    He sees her.  Shes sitting alone, by 
    the edge of the water.
           (beat)
    Please, God...

Kyle opens his eyes.

And there she is.  Standing in front of him. 

             MARLEY
    I was tired of sitting.

He laughs, grabs her, twirls.

             MARLEY
	(CONTD)
    I knew youd find me.

She runs loving hands across his face.  He squeezes her tight.

             KYLE
    Lets get you out of here.

She doesnt move.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    Come on.

             MARLEY
    I cant.

             KYLE
    Its easy.  Follow me.  

She shakes her head.  No.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    Your... your mothers there.


                                     104.
             MARLEY
    Mom?

             KYLE
    She wants to see you.  So badly.

             MARLEY
    Please tell her something.  Tell her 
    it wasnt her fault.  Please. 

             KYLE
    Tell her yourself.

             MARLEY
    Kyle.  I have to stay.

             KYLE
    That's not true.  Come with me.

             MARLEY
    It was the life I always dreamed of.  
    Thank you.

             KYLE
    No.  No, Marley.  Stop.

He wants to fight it.  But he knows she's right.

He looks around the pond, at the blackness closing in.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    Why here?  Why this darkness? 

             MARLEY
    After Laura died, this is where I 
    went.  Its where Ive been ever 
    since.  Except, when I was with you.

And thats when Kyle understands.  Resolve hardens his face.

             KYLE
    No.  Not like this.  Im not letting 
    you stay here.

             MARLEY
    Its where I belong--

He pulls her to him.  Kisses her.  Its THE kiss.  Full of 
sureness, fire.

She gives herself to him.

Then his lips drift to her ear:


                                     105.
             KYLE
    Listen to me.
           (beat)
    This is the kind of party you 
    deserve.  So many people love you.  
    Happy Birthday, Marley.

CUT TO: THE DUCK POND

A BIG BAND plays DIXIELAND JAZZ while party-goers whoop it up. 

Kyle and Marley, late 70s now, hold each-other in a slow 
dance - defying the upbeat music.

Marley looks around at the park, now filled with lights and 
joy.  But then she sees Kyles creased face.  Her aged hand.

             MARLEY
    Were so wrinkly.

             KYLE
    Its our story.  And this - this is 
    our happy ending.
           (beat)
    You see that over there?

Marley looks over.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    Your damn ducks, begging for food.

A little girl, the spitting image of Sarah at 5, runs up.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    Look whos here to tug on your skirt.

             MARLEY
    Casey-Belle.  You want to dance?

Kyle hoists the girl into Marleys arms.  The three of them 
dance as the sun sinks closer to the horizon.

Their daughters, Elizabeth and Sarah, both now middle-aged, 
gather their families closer to Kyle and Marley.  

A woman in her 20s, looking like Marley did at that age, 
takes Casey from Marley and Kyles arms.  

She leans in to touch her cheek to Marleys.  

             YOUNG WOMAN
    Happy Birthday, Granny.


                                     106.
Parents, children, grandchildren and great grandchildren all 
pile onto the dance floor.

             KYLE
    Do you know how very much I love you?

             MARLEY
    More and more every day.  

He presses old but tender lips to her creased eyelids.

She opens her eyes.  Over his shoulder, Marley sees something.

Something... wonderful.

Kyle follows her eyes, turns.  He tries to see through the 
crowd.  Dancers step to the right, whirl to the left.

             KYLE
    What is it?

             MARLEY
    I see her.

             KYLE
    Who?

             MARLEY
    I see Laura.

             KYLE
    Laura?


He searches the crowd...

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    I don't see her.
           (realizes)
    That means--

Kyle breaks.  Tears slide down his face.

Her eyes go back to him.  Sad.  Happy.

             MARLEY
    Shes waiting for me.

One more sweet kiss.  And Kyle feels the world slipping away.

             MARLEY
	(CONTD)
    My prince.


             KYLE
    Marley.  Please dont go.


                                     107.
A SOUND calls to him.  Its a faint BEEP.

             MARLEY
	(V.O.)
    I love you.


INT. MARLEYS ROOM - HOSPITAL

The BEEP of Marleys heart monitor.  Slowing.

Kyle kisses Marleys closed eyes.  Her breathings shallow.

             ELIZABETH
    I was never able to hold her like 
    that.  She hasnt let me touch her 
    since Laura died.

             KYLE
    Come here.


             ELIZABETH
    She hates me.  

             KYLE
    No.  Never.


Elizabeth wants to believe it.  But cant.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    Marley loves you.  She always has.
           (beat)
    She named our first daughter for you.  

Her eyes go to her Marley.  Yearning.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    Come here.


Elizabeth takes Kyles place on the bed.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    She wanted me to tell you something.

Kyle puts Marley into the arms of her mother.

             KYLE
	(CONTD)
    She said, it wasnt your fault.

The words take Elizabeths breath away.

             ELIZABETH
    My sweet, sweet girl.  Forgive me.

She cradles her daughter close, rocks her.


                                     108.
Kyle watches them.  Then sees a vase of STARGAZER LILIES.

             ELIZABETH
	(CONTD)
    I brought them to her every week.  
    She was fascinated by the color.

             KYLE
    She saw them.  Theyre her favorites.

He looks at Marley, lying still in Elizabeths arms.  He 
shifts weight off his bad leg, stands awkwardly.

             ELIZABETH
    Its okay.  Sit with us.

He sits, cradles Marleys fingers.  Elizabeth lays her hand 
over their joined hands.

             ELIZABETH
	(CONTD)
    Thank you.

             DR. BENEFIELD
    Kyle?



She holds out a SMALL BOOK.

             DR. BENEFIELD
	(CONTD)
    This was on the desk.  

Its Marleys journal.  On the cover: a drawing of a YELLOW 
KITE, pulled by the wind.

Kyle opens it.  Reads.  Then, just a glimmer of a smile.  

             KYLE
    Did you know Marley wrote childrens 
    books?

             ELIZABETH
    I... I dont know much about her.
           (beat)
    Will you tell me about my daughter?

             KYLE
    Ill tell you everything.

EXT. PARK - SOME MONTHS LATER

A bright yellow kite lies on the grass.  A strong breeze 
catches it, the toy skitters across the ground...

...lifts into the air and is pulled taut.  

Kyle tightens his grip, the kite hovers above the trees.  


                                     109.
It TUGS forcefully.  

He rolls out more string, lets it fly higher.  

Satisfied for only a moment, the kite TUGS again. 

Kyle laughs.  Then, a sigh.  Bittersweet.

His grip loosens, the kite pulls.  

Fingers open, the string slips through his hand.  

He... lets go.

The kites nylon ripples, as if dancing.  It sways from side 
to side.  Teasing him.  Playing with him.

Then the wind catches it.  The kite flies away, just a tiny 
yellow dot in a big blue sky.

Kyle watches its journey.

             KYLE
    Go, baby.  Go.

And just like that - its gone.
