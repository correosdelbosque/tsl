Dawn breaks the horizon.

INT. UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING

A huge, tome-filled bookshelf looms in the b.g. of a
large, contemporary Mediterranean-style living room.

The large panoramic view shows a beautiful vantage of
Central Park below.

ON TRACK

An ALARM CLOCK BEEPS.

INT. DARK MASTER BEDROOM - DIGITAL CLOCK

It reads six A.M.

A man’s hand reaches over to stop it.

INT. PLUSH HOME GYMNASIUM

The MAN sprints on the treadmill.
The time on it reads
      The distance to the left -- 7.2 miles.
47:40.

The PHONE RINGS in the b.g. but the Man can’t hear it.

INT. SPACIOUS STEAM/SHOWER

He sits on the bench, takes a steam, and shaves.

INT. BEDROOM - DRESSER

A money roll of hundreds.
A Rolex
A cell phone.
Presidente on top of a list of betting codes (i.e. K-41,
M-63, etc.), dollar amounts, and random sports cities.

The Man systematically puts everything in its proper
place and exits the bedroom.

INT. GIANT KITCHEN - LOUD BLENDER

The Man turns it off, pours his protein shake into a
glass, and takes a giant sip.
A pot and pan holder
hovers above the marble island countertop.

HIS POV

The sports caption on the New York Times reads "THIS
                                A PREVIEW"
WEEKEND -- BREEDER’S CUP AT HOLLYWOOD PARK:
with a picture of a horse winning a race below.
The
article reads "Sweet Di Eyes Triple Crown."

                                      2.

BACK TO SCENE

A red light flashes on the MESSAGE RECORDER to his left.
He reaches over, pushes a button, and it BEEPS.

                 MALE (V.O.)
       Hey, Jack.
It’s Frank.
Sorry to
       be calling you so late.
It’s...
       Christ, three-forty, six-forty
       your time.

The despondent male voice quickly comes to tears.

                 MALE (V.O.)
       I’m sorry, Jackie.
About
                But I really need to
everything.
       talk to you.
Call me... please.

The man hangs up and the RECORDER BEEPS.

TIGHT ON JACK CARTER

Hair slicked back, crisp blue suit, Windsor knot, and a
long leather "stand the fuck back" coat. You can’t tell
if the hard look in his eyes is sudden or permanent.

Jack stares at the cordless but doesn’t pick it up.
Tears of frustration almost formulate, he washes the rest
of the shake down the drain, and he exits.

The

                 JACK
       You got an extra subway token on
       you?

Dexter turns and casually hands one to him.

                 DEXTER
       Sorry you have to deal with this
       fucking bullshit, Jack.

                 JACK

       He called the 800 number, used his
       code, K-25, put five grand on the
       49ers, lost, and claimed that it
       wasn’t his voice on the recorder.

                 JACK
       Meaning someone stole his code.

Dexter nods as the subway takes off again.

                 DEXTER

Dexter opens his jacket and shows Jack his gun.

Shut your mouth

That’s what I want.

You
       analyze numbers ’til you’re blue
       in the face, but when it comes
       down to betting, a.k.a. thinking
       with your money, your common sense
       is as scarce as your ethics.

                 DAVIS
       And what you do is ethical?

                 JACK
       If you’d ever hit one you’d think
       I was ethical.

                 JACK
       There are two reasons why you
       should never bet on team sports.
       The players aren’t interested in
       the spread and they’re not using
       their money.
It’s that simple.

                 DAVIS
       Yes, I grasp the concept.

                 JACK
       So why are you putting ten grand
       on Miami when they’re playing in
       Green Bay and it’s twenty below
       zero?

            (as Davis says
             nothing)
       I’m sorry that it got this
       pathetic, but you owe ninety-six
       thousand --

                 DAVIS
       I owe eighty-seven!

                 JACK
       You owe eighty-seven plus a ten
       percent book fee.
I’m letting
       that 49ers incident slide. But
       it’s time to act intelligent.
       You’ve dealt with Dex, he’s
       allowed you to be fiscally
       irresponsible, it’s over.

Davis laughs and gives a condescending shake of the head.

Jack punches him hard in the face for this.
Blood rushes
painfully from Davis’s nose.
It’s so crazy in the diner,
however, nobody notices a thing.

       It’s okay.

He walks to the Van Gogh painting, pulls it off,

Still donning the hat, he points the gun at Jeremy.

Jeremy does the combination and opens it.

TIGHT ON SAFE

Jack looks in and pulls out five manila envelopes,
leaving the money behind.

Jack flips through them and looks up.

                 JACK
       You got everyone in your back
       pocket, don’t you?

Jeremy shoots a glance to his desk and thinks about it.

       You can’t go around recruiting
       little girls, Jeremy.

                 JEREMY
       I’m sorry it happened, Jack.
But
                          And once
I didn’t recruit anyone.
       I discovered her age, I
       immediately put a halt on it.
I
       didn’t get to where I am by being
       stupid.

                 JACK
       Emotionally, physically,
       sexually... she’ll never be the
       same.

Please.

You killed my

       Hold on a second.
I didn’t kill
       anyone.

                 JACK
       What does it matter if you
       actually pulled the trigger or
       not?
You had the most to lose.
       You might not have gotten your
       hands dirty, but you picked up the
       bill.

Jeremy’s feeling of total helplessness is obvious.

                 JEREMY
       It’s clear you’re going to be
       pigheaded and not listen to
       anything I have to say!

                 JACK
       Don’t need to.
As a poker player,
       you of all people know that
       everything is in the eyes.

Jack locks the office door and gestures to the corner.

                 JACK
       Get over there and face the wall.

                 JEREMY
       What can I do to convince you,
       Jack?

                 JACK
       You can do what I say.

                 JEREMY

       Fine.

       You want me to put on a ’dunce’
       cap?

       No.

Jeremy drops to his knees and whines.

                 JACK
       Now I want you to picture
       something, Jeremy.
Visualize,
       since that’s what you’re best at.

Jack stares at the back of Jeremy’s balding head.

                 JACK
       Imagine watching your little
       girl... your everything... on a
       computer screen.
On it, you see
       her... drugged out of her mind...
       forced to engage in sex acts too
       hideous to mention.
Now imagine
       it being done by people you know.
       Your supposed friends... who come
                            And
into your bar all the time.
       you know they can kill you.
But
       you don’t care.
So at the first
       opportunity, justice in your
       guts --

                 JEREMY
       -- drive to the cops rather than

Jack presses the gun muzzle to the back of Jeremy’s head.
