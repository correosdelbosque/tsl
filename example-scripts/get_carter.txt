INT. UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING

A huge, tome-filled bookshelf looms in the b.g. of a
large, contemporary Mediterranean-style living room.

The large panoramic view shows a beautiful vantage of
Central Park below.

ON TRACK

An ALARM CLOCK BEEPS.

INT. DARK MASTER BEDROOM - DIGITAL CLOCK

It reads six A.M.

A mans hand reaches over to stop it.

INT. PLUSH HOME GYMNASIUM

The MAN sprints on the treadmill.
The time on it reads
      The distance to the left -- 7.2 miles.
47:40.

The PHONE RINGS in the b.g. but the Man cant hear it.

INT. SPACIOUS STEAM/SHOWER

He sits on the bench, takes a steam, and shaves.

INT. BEDROOM - DRESSER

A money roll of hundreds.
A Rolex
A cell phone.
Presidente on top of a list of betting codes (i.e. K-41,
M-63, etc.), dollar amounts, and random sports cities.

The Man systematically puts everything in its proper
place and exits the bedroom.

INT. GIANT KITCHEN - LOUD BLENDER

The Man turns it off, pours his protein shake into a
glass, and takes a giant sip.
A pot and pan holder
hovers above the marble island countertop.


HIS POV

BACK TO SCENE

A red light flashes on the MESSAGE RECORDER to his left.
He reaches over, pushes a button, and it BEEPS.

                 MALE (V.O.)
       Hey, Jack.
Its Frank.
Sorry to
       be calling you so late.
Its...
       Christ, three-forty, six-forty
       your time.

The despondent male voice quickly comes to tears.

                 MALE (V.O.)
       Im sorry, Jackie.
About
                But I really need to
everything.
       talk to you.
Call me... please.

The man hangs up and the RECORDER BEEPS.

TIGHT ON JACK CARTER

Hair slicked back, crisp blue suit, Windsor knot, and a
long leather "stand the fuck back" coat. You cant tell
if the hard look in his eyes is sudden or permanent.

Jack stares at the cordless but doesnt pick it up.
Tears of frustration almost formulate, he washes the rest
of the shake down the drain, and he exits.

Dexter turns and casually hands one to him.

       He called the 800 number, used his
       code, K-25, put five grand on the
       49ers, lost, and claimed that it
       wasnt his voice on the recorder.

                 JACK
       Meaning someone stole his code.

Dexter nods as the subway takes off again.

Dexter opens his jacket and shows Jack his gun.

You

       down to betting, a.k.a. thinking
       with your money, your common sense
       is as scarce as your ethics.

                 DAVIS
       And what you do is ethical?

                 JACK
       There are two reasons why you
       should never bet on team sports.
       The players arent interested in
       the spread and theyre not using
       their money.
Its that simple.

                 DAVIS
       Yes, I grasp the concept.

                 JACK
       So why are you putting ten grand
       on Miami when theyre playing in
       Green Bay and its twenty below
       zero?

            (as Davis says
             nothing)
       Im sorry that it got this
       pathetic, but you owe ninety-six
       thousand --

                 DAVIS
       I owe eighty-seven!

                 JACK
       You owe eighty-seven plus a ten
       percent book fee.
Im letting
       that 49ers incident slide. But
       its time to act intelligent.
       Youve dealt with Dex, hes
       allowed you to be fiscally
       irresponsible, its over.

Davis laughs and gives a condescending shake of the head.

Jack punches him hard in the face for this.
Blood rushes
painfully from Daviss nose.
Its so crazy in the diner,
however, nobody notices a thing.

       Its okay.

Theyd

       new papers, new plates                       , take it
       out of state.
Maybe Arizona or

Jeremys feeling of total helplessness is obvious.

                 JEREMY
       Its clear youre going to be
       pigheaded and not listen to
       anything I have to say!

                 JACK
       Dont need to.
As a poker player,
       you of all people know that
       everything is in the eyes.

Jack locks the office door and gestures to the corner.

                 JACK
       Get over there and face the wall.

                 JEREMY
       What can I do to convince you,
       Jack?

                 JACK
       You can do what I say.

                 JEREMY

       Fine.

            (moving to the corner)
       You want me to put on a dunce
       cap?

       No.

                 JACK
Just get down on your knees.

Youre not this

                 JACK
       Get down on your knees!

Jeremy drops to his knees and whines.

                 JACK
       Now I want you to picture
       something, Jeremy.
Visualize,
       since thats what youre best at.

Jack stares at the back of Jeremys balding head.

                 JACK
       Imagine watching your little
       girl... your everything... on a
       computer screen.
On it, you see
       her... drugged out of her mind...
       forced to engage in sex acts too
       hideous to mention.
Now imagine
       it being done by people you know.
       Your supposed friends... who come
                            And
into your bar all the time.
       you know they can kill you.
But
       you dont care.
So at the first
       opportunity, justice in your
       guts --

                 JEREMY
       -- drive to the cops rather than
       listen to reason!

                 JACK
       Because there is no reason!
       Theres nothing to discuss!
            (softening)
       Except when you stop at that red
       light, you feel this...

Jack presses the gun muzzle to the back of Jeremys head.
Jeremy starts to cry.

the door but it quickly disappears.

                 JACK
       And theres no mistaking what it
       is... whats going to happen.
You
       know in the pit of your stomach...
       you are going to die.

       And that you have failed to defend
       the person who needed you most.
       Can you imagine having that
       feeling?

                 JEREMY
       Jack, please, I beg you!

                 JACK
       Too late, Jeremy.

                 JEREMY
       Ill give you everything I have!

                 JACK
       It would never be enough.
