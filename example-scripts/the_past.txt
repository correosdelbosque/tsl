 1. INT. CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT  DAY 
 
Behind the glass wall, which separates the baggage claim area from the busy airport terminal, MARIE is awaiting the arrival of a passenger. She is holding a simple bouquet of flowers. She scans the crowd of the newly arrived passengers. Maries gaze reveals a sense of worry. Her eyes fix on a man who has his back towards her. She looks more carefully, uncertain that he is the man she is waiting for. The man is waiting along with the other passengers for his suitcase. Marie changes position so that perhaps shell be able to see his face. She briefly sees his profile. Hes AHMAD, forty-four years old. She spontaneously raises her hand to catch his attention but changes her mind. She takes off her wristbrace and stuffs it into her purse. She prefers to watch him for a few moments from afar. Marie is intensely watching Ahmad; he has not yet seen her. One by one, the passengers take their suitcases and leave. Only Ahmad is still waiting next to the empty carousel for his suitcase. Ahmad wanders through the baggage claim area looking for a representative to report his missing suitcase. He speaks to a member of the airport staff. Marie tries to get his attention from afar by waving her hand. She signals to a passenger who is holding a suitcase and walking by Ahmad to get him to look at her. The passenger speaks to Ahmad. He now turns his head and sees Marie through the glass wall. Happy, he walks towards her. They both come face-to-face on either side of the glass wall. They cannot hear each other. From the expression on their faces, it is clear that they have not seen each other in a long time. She understands that his luggage has not arrived with the flight.  
 
2. EXT. OUTSIDE CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT  PARKING LOT  DAY 

Its pouring rain. Marie and Ahmad run side by side through the parking lot. They are laughing complicitily. They jump into the car, both soaking wet.  
 
 
3. EXT. CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT  PARKING LOT  INT. SAMIRS CAR  DAY 
 
Marie opens the door and sits behind the wheel. The water is dripping down her face. Ahmad also gets in, struggling to catch his breath.  

                MARIE 
         You still smoke? 
                

                AHMAD 
         No, Im getting old. 
          
Marie reaches over to take a box of tissues. She dries her face, then offers one to Ahmad, who does the same. Marie tosses her bag in the back. Ahmad does the same with his backpack and the bouquet. He notices the back of the car is loaded with all sorts of things. Several clothes covered in plastic dry-cleaning bags are hanging from the ceiling of the car.  
 

 

                AHMAD 
                 ( j o k i n g l y )  
         You bought a car? 

                MARIE 
                 ( l a u g h i n g )  
         No, I borrowed it. 

 
Marie starts the car. Ahmad is surprised by the music that comes on. She turns the radio off and attempts to dry her hair with the cars heater which is still warming up. Then, she struggles to put the car in gear. Her wrist hurts, so, she tries with her left hand. 
                

 

                AHMAD 
         Whats wrong? 
                

                MARIE 
         My wrist hurts. 

 
Ahmad shifts the gear for her. 
                

                AHMAD 
                 ( j o k i n g l y )  
         Youre getting old too. 
                 
                MARIE 
                 ( l s m i i n g )  
         Look out your side and see if I have 
         enough room. 

 
Ahmad looks out the passenger-side window and Marie starts to back up. 
 

                AHMAD 
         You have room 

 
The car hits something. 
 

                AHMAD 
         Stop! What are you doing?

TITLE: THE PAST                      

EXT. HIGHWAY  INT. SAMIRS CAR  DAY 
 
The rain has eased up. Ahmad and Marie drive through a tunnel and continue on a highway leading to the city. 
 



                AHMAD 
         Do the girls know Im here? 



                MARIE 
         No. 

                AHMAD 
         Didnt you tell them?! 

                MARIE 
         I thought you might let us down at the 
         last minute, like the last time. 

 
 
Ahmad falls silent. Marie looks at him and smiles. As if shes trying to soften her harsh comment. 

                 
                MARIE 
         Put it in fourth. 

 
Ahmad shifts the gear for Marie. 
 
                AHMAD 
         Im here now, let them know. Id like 
         to see them. 

                MARIE 
         Were going to see them now. 



                AHMAD 
         Where? 

                MARIE 
         Were picking up Lucie and going home. 

                AHMAD 
         Didnt you book a hotel for me? 

                MARIE  
         No. 

                AHMAD 
         You were supposed to. 

                MARIE 
         I wasnt sure youd come. 

                AHMAD 
         What do you mean you werent sure? 

                MARIE 
         I wasnt sure. 

                AHMAD 
         Listen, something came up last time. 
         Just two days before I... 

                MARIE 
         Dont worry about it. Dont start 
         making excuses, we dont have all day! 

                AHMAD 
         Just because I cancelled my trip once? 

                MARIE 
         Not just for that. 

 
They both fall quiet and go on driving for a while in silence. 
 

                MARIE 
         The girls would like to have you. 
                 
                AHMAD 
         I dont want to disturb. 
                 
                MARIE 
         You wont disturb us. Youll have to 
         come for your suitcase anyway, when 
         its delivered. 
          
Ahmad doesnt reply. 
 

                MARIE 
         At least, come and change your clothes 
         so you dont catch a cold. 

 
Ahmad still doesnt reply and wipes the steamed-up windshield. 
 
INT. SAMIRS CAR  EXT. THE STREET OF LUCIES SCHOOL  DAY 
 
Students exit a school. Ahmad sits alone in the car, watching the students file out through the window. A police officer knocks on the window. Ahmad gets out of the car and goes towards her to dissuade her from writing the ticket. She tells him to move the car. Ahmad sits in the drivers seat. 
          
INT. SAMIRS CAR  EXT. THE STREETS AROUND LUCIES SCHOOL  DAY 
 
Ahmad is behind the wheel and cant find a place to stop. He is forced to go down a one-way a street and turn onto another street to circle back to the school. The sun shines into his eyes. As he lowers the sun visor, a few pieces of paper fall out. He tries to pick them up as he is driving. Among the documents, he sees an identification photo of a man in his early thirties. He stares at the picture and drives for a moment while holding it in his hand. He tucks the papers back in their place. He turns onto the street where the school is located. The crowds of students have thinned out. He sees Marie standing by the side of the road looking worriedly for her car ans Ahmad. She sees him and gets in.  
 

                AHMAD 
         She was going to give you a ticket I 
         went around the block. 

 
Marie does not respond. She seems upset.  
 

                AHMAD 
         So? 

                MARIE 
         Shes left. 

                AHMAD 
         Did she know you were coming to pick 
         her up? 

 
She asks him to get going and takes out a cigarette and lights it. She rolls down the window to let the smoke out. Ahmad realizes shes upset.  

 

                AHMAD 
         Maybe she went home because you were 
         late? 

 

                MARIE 
         Its not her first time. 



                AHMAD 
         Why? 

                MARIE 
         I dont know. Last night she came home 
         at 11. 

                AHMAD 
         They all go through this at her age, 
         its normal. 

                MARIE 
         Its not normal. 

                AHMAD 
         Why whats wrong with her? 

                MARIE 
         Shes been givng me hell for two 
         months over nothing. Maybe you could 
         talk to her, try and see whats wrong 
         with her? 

                AHMAD 
         If she still remembers me after all 
         this time. 

                MARIE 
         She loves you. 

                AHMAD 
         After all this time? 

                MARIE 
         Where are you going? Turn right! 

Ahmad, who has forgotten the way, follows Maries directions. 
 

                AHMAD 
         I was daydreaming. 
                  
                MARIE 
         Youve forgotten everything. 

                AHMAD 
         I was distracted. 

EXT. STREET OUTSIDE MARIES HOUSE  DAY 
 
A long, wide street cuts through a residental neighborhood of similar stand alone houses near a railline. Ahmad pulls over in front of the house. Marie gets out of the car to go inside. 
 

                AHMAD  
         Marie-Anne 

 
Marie pauses and turns to Ahmad. Ahmad takes the papers and documents from above the sun visor and holds them out to Marie. 



                AHMAD 
         You shouldnt leave this here. Its 
         risky. 

 
Marie takes the documents and puts them in her purse. She senses that Ahmad has already seen the picture. Ahmad also gets out. 

EXT. MARIES HOUSE  THE FRONT YARD  DAY 

The front yard of Maries two-story house is separated from the street by a metal fence and a gate. Ahmad looks at the yard from between the gaps in the fence. A ten-year-old girl, LEA and a six-year-old boy, FOUAD are busy playing in the yard. Lea and Fouad are struggling to put into place the chain of an old bicycle, probably belonging to Lea. Marie who has entered the yard, starts picking up the hanging laundry. 
 

 

                MARIE 
         Is Lucie home? 



                LEA 
         No. 
 
She goes in the house. Ahmad discreetly enters the yard. 
 

                LEA 
         You broke it. 

                FOUAD 
         Pull harder... 

                LEA 
         I cant. Ill hurt my hand. 
                 
                AHMAD 
              ( t o   F o u a d   a n d   L e a )  
         No, not like that. First put one side 
         on, then the other. 

The two children have only now noticed Ahmads presence. Surprised, they stop pulling on the chain. Ahmad takes the chain from them. 
 

                AHMAD 
         Ill show you. This goes there...Its 
         dried out. 
           

                 ( t o   L E A )  
         We need some oil. You know where to 
         find some? It used to be in the 
         cupboard in the shed. 

 



                LEA 
         Ahmad! 
 
Ahmad is happy that Lea has recognized him so quickly. He holds her tightly in his arms. Surprised and curious, Fouad looks at them.  
 

                AHMAD 
         My dear Lea... Youre doing good? 
         Youve grown so much, sweetie. 


 Ahmad holds out his hand to Fouad. 
 

                AHMAD 
                 
         Hello, Sir. 

 
Fouad does not shake his hand. 
 

                AHMAD 
              ( j o k i n g l y   t o   L e a )  
         Your friend is ignoring me.  Whats 
         his name? 

 
                FOUAD 
         His name is Fouad. 

                AHMAD 
         Hello, Fouad. 

 
Fouad shakes his hand. 
 
INT. MARIES HOUSE  DAY 
 
Maries house is two-stories. On the first level is the kitchen with a window facing the backyard, Maries room, the study with the computer and the childrens room. On the second floor, which is reached via a narrow stairway, there is only one bedroom with a window, which faces the front yard and street. Although the house is old, it is clear that it has been recently renovated. The paint on the walls has not yet fully dried and a ladder and painting supplies can be seen throughout the house. Marie climbs the stairs to the small upstairs room she has prepared for Ahmad. In the bedroom is a small wooden bunk bed, presumably belonging to her daughters. She lays the clothing she has brought for Ahmad on the bed. While she is making the lower bed, shes watches through the window Ahmad who is busy fixing the bike with Fouad. She opens the window facing the yard. 

                MARIE 
         Come inside, Ahmad. And you, Fouad, 
         come get your things in the bedroom. 

 
INT. MARIES HOUSE  DOWNSTAIRS  DAY 
 
Marie goes to the bedroom to dry her hair. Ahmad and Fouad come inside. Lea comes out of the kitchen.  
 

                LEA 
         It wasnt in the shed. 
                 
                AHMAD 
         Then you changed its place while I was 
         away.  

                FOUAD 
         Theres some in my fathers car. 

 

 
Ahmad heard what Fouad said but does not react. He notices the freshly painted walls. As he wanders through the house, it is clear that he has memories of this place. Lea and Fouad are standing watching him. 

                AHMAD 
                 ( t o   L e a )  
         Wheres the shelf that was here? The 
         old wooden shelf... 

                LEA 
         We moved it. 

                AHMAD 
         There were books of mine on it. 
          

                MARIE 
         All your stuffs put away in the shed. 

 
Marie, facing the mirror in her bedroom is trying, despite her aching wrist, to blowdry her hair. Ahmad peeks into the bedroom, leaning against the doorframe. 
 

                MARIE 
         Watch the paint. 

 
Ahmad straightens up.  
 

                AHMAD 
         Wasnt the other color better? 
                 
                MARIE 
         Its not done yet. My wrist made me 
         stop. 

 
Ahmad enters the room. 
 

                AHMAD 
                 ( j o k i n g l y )  
         You shouldve waited for me to come. I 
         I couldve done it while Im here. It 
         wouldve kept me busy.  

 
He takes the blowdryer from Marie to help her. Standing close to her, he dries her hair while she brushes it with her other hand.  
 

                AHMAD 
         Ill do it. 
                 
                MARIE 
         Didnt you want to go to a hotel?  
         Ouch! Youre burning me. 

 
Ahmad holds the blowdryer further back and falls silent. Marie 
continues brushing her hair. 
 

                MARIE 
         Its fine, thanks. 

 
Ahmad turns off the blowdryer. Marie gets up. She picks up the phone and walks out of the room while dialing. 

 

                MARIE 
         I left some clothes upstairs. Go 
         change before you catch a cold. 

 
Ahmad remains in the room. As the phone rings, Marie walks towards Leas room. She sees Fouad, standing in the hallway, keeping an eye on the bedroom. 

                 
                MARIE 
                 ( t o   F o u a d )  
         What are you doing here? Go on. Get 
         your things and go upstairs. Youll 
         sleep there and Lucie here. 

                FOUAD 
         I dont like it upstairs. 

 
Ahmad comes out of the bedroom and walks towards the stairs. 
 

                MARIE 
         Its just while Ahmads here, then 
         youll come back downstairs. Hurry up, 
         please. (o n   t h e   p h o n e )  
         Lucie, call me back, please. I have a 
         surprise for you. 

 
Marie hangs up. Fouad is upset as he grabs his things and pulls his sheets off the bed. 
 

INT. MARIES HOUSE - UPSTAIRS BEDROOM  DAY 
 
Ahmad is looking out the window. Everything brings back old memories. Fouad pushes the door open with his body and walks in holding all of his bedding. Exasperated, Fouad dumps his things on the bottom bunk and climbs up to make the bed on the top. Ahmad is staring at Fouad as he struggles to make his bed. Ahmad helps him, scrutinizing his expression. 
 

                AHMAD 
         Is that your fathers car outside? 


                FOUAD 
         Yes.  

                AHMAD 
         Do you live here? 



                FOUAD 
         Yes. 

                AHMAD 
         With your father? 



                FOUAD 
         Yes. 

                AHMAD 
         Since when? 



                FOUAD 
         Since school started. 

Ahmad is taken aback by Fouads answer. He sits on the edge of the lower bed. Fouad is still struggling with the sheet. 
 

                AHMAD 
         Dont bother making your bed. You can 
         sleep downstairs in your own bed. 

 
Fouad takes the sheet and climbs down the ladder of the bed. He again gathers his things to leave the room. 
 
INT. MARIES HOUSE  DOWNSTAIRS  DAY  
 
Fouad comes down the stairs. Marie is getting ready and sees Fouad and comes towards him. 
 

 

                MARIE 
         Why are you coming down? 

                FOUAD 
         He told me to. 

 
Surprised, Marie walks upstairs. 

INT. MARIES HOUSE  UPSTAIRS BEDROOM  DAY  
 
Marie opens the door. Ahmad is sitting on the edge of the bed. Marie realizes how upset he is. She enters the room and closes the door. 

                MARIE 
         There arent enough beds for the three 
         of them downstairs. 
                 
                AHMAD 
         You live with someone? 
                 
                MARIE 
         Yes. 

                AHMAD 
         You didnt tell me. 
                 
                MARIE 
                ( s u r p r i s e d )  
         What do you mean? I wrote it in my 
         email. 

                AHMAD 
         What email? 

                MARIE 
         I dont know which one. One of them. 

                AHMAD 
         I didnt get any. 

                MARIE 
         So, why did you want to stay at a 
         hotel? 

                AHMAD 
         I didnt want to disturb you. 

                MARIE 
         In any case, I wrote you. 

                AHMAD 
         I didnt get anything. 

                MARIE 
         You didnt wonder why I asked you to 
         come for the divorce? 

 
Ahmad is quiet. Marie leans against the wall. Their eyes meet. After a long silence, Ahmad finally speaks. 
 

                AHMAD 
         Does he know Im here? 



                MARIE 
         Yes. 

                AHMAD 
         Im leaving then. 

                MARIE 
         He wont come by while youre here. Or 
         hell let me know, for sure. 

                AHMAD 
         When did you send that email? 
                 
                MARIE 
         I dont know. 

                AHMAD 
         It must still be in your inbox. 
                 
                MARIE 
         I guess so. Do you want me to show it 
         to you? 

                AHMAD 
         I asked you to book a hotel for me. 
                 
                MARIE 
         I did last time and you didnt come. I 
         had to cancel. 

                AHMAD 
         How much did it cost you? 

 
Marie is hurt. She moves towards the door. 
 

                AHMAD 
         What time do I have to be in court 
         tomorrow? 


 
                MARIE 
         You said youd stay to talk to Lucie  

                AHMAD 
         When will she be home? 

 

 
Marie shrugs. 
 

                AHMAD 
         I can meet up with her tomorrow. 

 
Marie opens the door. 
 

                MARIE 
         I was hoping youd keep your promise 
         for once. 

 
Marie leaves the bedroom. Ahmad is upset and remains seated on the edge of the bed. Marie hears his answer as she goes down the stairway. 
 

                AHMAD 
         I didnt promise anything. 
          

                MARIE 
         My mistake. Sorry. 
                 

 
INT. MARIES HOUSE  HALLWAY  DAY  
 
Marie comes down the stairs. A can of paint has spilt on to the floor. The footstool, which Lea had brought from the shed, is next to the spilt paint. Marie is furious, she sees paint covered footprints leading towards the garden where the children are playing. Marie storms into theyard.  
 
EXT. MARIES HOUSE  YARD  DAY 
 
Marie comes to the yard. She sees Fouads shoes, which are covered in paint. He is putting dishwashing liquid on the dry bicycle chain. She lunges towards him. 
 

                MARIE 
                  ( a n g r y )  
         Fouad! Cant you watch where you walk? 

 
Fouad is looking at the bicycle chain and does not look up. 
          

                MARIE  
         Why do I spend hours cleaning? For you 
         to make a mess? Look at me! 

 

                LEA 
               ( p o i n t i n g   t o   t h e  
              d i s h w a s h i n g   l i q u i d )  
         We went for this. 
                 
                MARIE 
                 ( t o   F o u a d )  
         I dont give a damn! 


 Fouad lifts his head and looks Marie in the eyes. They are both staring at each other. Suddenly Fouad moves towards the front gate to leave in a huff. Exasperated, Marie tries to stop him. Fouad stubbornly throws himself on the ground and Marie struggles to get him back inside.  
 

                 
                MARIE 
         Get back here! Come here! 
          

                FOUAD 
         I wanna go home! 

 
Lea goes towards Fouad to help her mom and convince Fouad to come back 
inside. 

           
INT. MARIES HOUSE  UPSTAIRS ROOM  EXT. YARD  DAY 
 
Ahmad is standing near the window, watching the scene below. In the yard, Marie is still struggling with Fouad. She finally wrestles him into her arms and drags him inside.  
 
INT. MARIES HOUSE  HALLWAY AND THE CHILDRENS ROOM  DAY 
 
Marie is struggling to contain Fouad who is flailing his arms and legs in resistance. She manages to bring him inside and sets him down on the bed. Lea is scared, she follows them. 
 

                MARIE 
         Im sorry! 
          

                FOUAD 
         I dont care! 
          

                MARIE 
                 ( p l e a d i n g )  
         Please, Fouad, calm down. 
          

                FOUAD 
         Youre not my mom. 
          

 

 
Fouad refuses to calm down. With no other choice, Marie leaves Fouad in the room, she locks the door behind her. Upset, Lea stands in the corner of the hallway. Fouad beats against the door with his fists. 

INT. MARIES HOUSE  HALLWAY, BATHROOM AND TOILET  DAY 
 
Marie has rolled up her sleeves. Despite the fact that she is running 
late she decides to quickly clean the paint spill before leaving. Ahmad 
comes down the stairs.  
 

                AHMAD 
         You should go, youre late Ill clean 
         this. 

                 
                MARIE 
         Ill do it. 
                 
                AHMAD 
         Not with your wrist, go. 

                 
                MARIE 
         I thought you were leaving. 
                 
                AHMAD 
         Ill wait for Lucie. Well see after. 

 
Marie gets up and rolls down her sleeves. She goes to the bathroom and washes her hands and face. The occasional sound of Fouad beating his fists against the door can still be heard.  
                 
                MARIE 
                 ( w o r r i e d )  
         Youll keep an eye on them? 
                 
                AHMAD 
         Go, dont worry. 

 
Ahmad goes towards the childrens room. He unlocks the door and enters. Lea is still standing in a corner of the hallway, looking sad. 
 
INT. MARIES HOUSE  CHILDRENS ROOM  DAY 
 
As Ahmad enters, Fouad tries to escape. Ahmad grabs him and drags him back in. Worried, Lea has come to the doorway. 
 
                AHMAD 
         Where are you going? Wait! 
                 
                FOUAD 
         Let me go. 

                AHMAD 
         Ill let you go. But first tell me 
         where you want to go. 
                 
                FOUAD 
         Im leaving!

                AHMAD 
         Where to? 
                 
                FOUAD 
         My house. 

                AHMAD 
         Wheres your house? 
                 
                LEA 
         Paris. He cant go, its too far. 

                FOUAD 
         Shut up! No one asked you. 
                 
                AHMAD 
         None of that in this house! Got it? 

 
Again Fouad tries to flee. 


                AHMAD 
         Lea, leave and close the door. We need 
         to talk. 

 
Lea closes the door and leaves. Ahmad forces Fouad to sit on the bed and gently sits down next to him. 
                 
                AHMAD 
         Whats wrong Fouad? What is it? 

 
               FOUAD 
         I want to go. 

                AHMAD 
         You want to call home? 
                 
                FOUAD 
         Theres no one in my home. 

                AHMAD 
         Whats the matter with here? Is it 
         because she told you off? But you were 
         misbehaving. You spilt the paint, you 
         caused trouble. Didnt you spill the 
         paint? 

                 
                FOUAD 
         Its not the paint. 

                AHMAD 
         What is it, then? Is it because Im 
         here? Do you want me to leave?  

 
Fouad does not respond. He has calmed down a bit. 
 
INT. DRYCLEANERS  DAY 
 
Long rows of clothing covered in plastic hang from rods running 
parallel along the ceiling. Large laundering machines are on and 
running. NAIMA, the young employee is covering freshly ironed clothing with plastic bags. On the glass door of the drycleaners, a piece of paper is taped which reads: Experienced drycleaners help wanted. Inquire within.  Marie quickly comes inside.  


                MARIE 
         Hello. 

                NAIMA 
         Hello, Maam. 

Marie sees SAMIRs feet among the rows of clothing. While holding some dry-cleaned clothes on his arm, Samir comes to the front counter. He is the man whose picture Ahmad had seen in the car. He acts coldly towards Marie. Marie takes the car documents out of her purse and puts them on the counter. Samir puts the clothing on the counter and on a piece of paper, writes down the list of items and the cost for their cleaning. 

                MARIE 
         The plane was late. 

 

                SAMIR 
         Hes here? 

                MARIE 
         Yes. 
 
Marie places the car documents in front of Samir. 
 

               MARIE 
         Here. 

                SAMIR 
         Where did you park it? 
                 
                MARIE 
         Right there. 
               ( p o i n t i n g   t o   t h e  
                 d o c u m e n t s )  
         You shouldnt leave this in the car. 
         Its risky. 

 

 
Samir takes the receipt for the clothing along with the clothes and the car documents from the counter to leave the drycleaners. 

EXT. STREET  SIDEWALK  DAY 
 
While holding the clothing on his arm, Samir is walking with Marie on the sidewalk towards his car. 
  

 

 

                MARIE 
         Did you go to the hospital? 


                SAMIR 
         Yes. 

                MARIE 
         How was she? 

                SAMIR 
         Same as usual. Fouads not with you? 
          

                MARIE 
         Was he supposed to come? 

                SAMIR 
         He called me to go pick him up. 

                MARIE 
                ( s u r p r i s e d )  
         Why? 

                 
                SAMIR 
         He asked me to pick him up. He didnt 
         want to stay there. 

                MARIE 
         I got upset with him. With both of 
         them. 

                SAMIR 
         Ill come and take him home with me 
         tonight. 

                MARIE 
         No reason to make a fuss. 

                SAMIR 
         Hed never called me to go fetch him 
         like that. 

                MARIE 
         Id never yelled like that.  

                SAMIR 
         Anyway, I promised Id go fetch him. 

                MARIE 
         Ok. I shouldnt have. Well make it up 
         tonight. 

 
They have now reached the car. Marie unlocks the car and opens the back door. Samir hangs the clothing on the rod above the backseat. He closes the door and takes the keys from Marie to get in behind the wheeland starts the car. Marie notices he is upset. Before the car drives off, she taps on the glass. Samir rolls down the window. 

                MARIE 
         If you want to come over, let me know 
         first. 

Marie takes off down the sidewalk. Samir is deep in thought. He puts the car in gear. While driving, he watches Marie. Samirs car slowly passes her. 
 
INT. PHARMACY  DAY 
 
Marie enters a pharmacy, goes behind the counter and greets her 
coworker, a middle-aged woman. She then goes to the back room, puts on her white uniform and stands behind the counter. 

INT. MARIES HOUSE  KITCHEN  EXT.  YARD  NIGHT 
 
In the backyard, Ahmad is roasting corn. Lea is helping him and takes a bite of one of the freshly grilled cobs. Ahmad fans the other corncobs on the grill. 
 

                AHMAD 
                ( i n   P e r s i a n )  
         Corn, hot corn! 

 
Lea mimics the sounds of his words. They laugh. Ahmad hands her another corncob. 
 

                AHMAD 
         Here, take this for him. 

 
Lea takes the corncob into the kitchen. In the kitchen, Fouad is 
sitting at the table, cutting the corn stalk with a knife. Lea holds the grilled corn out to him. He ignores her.  

 
                LEA 
         Take it. 
          
		      FOUAD 
         I dont want it. 

 
Lea notices Fouads finger is bleeding. 

                LEA 
         You cut your hand. 
                 
                FOUAD 
         No I didnt. 
                 
                LEA 
         Yes, you did. Youre bleeding! 

 
Lea walks towards the door to the backyard. 
 

                LEA 
         Ahmad! He cut his finger! 

 
INT. MARIES HOUSE  BATHROOM AND HALLWAY  NIGHT 

 

 

In the bathroom, Ahmad picks Fouad up, holds his finger under the tap and washes it. Lea now comes into the bathroom with the first-aid kit. Lea opens the kit. Ahmad pours some disinfectant over Fouads finger. Fouad, who is clearly in pain, tries to be brave. They hear the front door opening. Intrigued, Ahmad leans toward the bathroom door to see who has entered the house. For a brief moment he sees LUCIE, Maries sixteen-year-old daughter, as she quickly climbs the stairs to the bedroom. He is relieved.  
 
INT. MARIES HOUSE  HALLWAY AND THE STAIRS  NIGHT  
 
Ahmad goes upstairs. He knocks on the door and hides waiting to 
surprise Lucie. He knocks again. Lucie opens the door and comes out. Ahmad covers her eyes from behind. Lucie is startled.  
                 
                LUCIE 
         Ahmad! 

 
Ahmad removes his hands and they hug each other. From downstairs, Fouad is standing in front of the bathroom and watching them. 
                 
                AHMAD 
         How did you know it was me? 

 
               LUCIE 
         I knew you were coming today. 

 
Ahmad is surprised at Lucies response.  
 
INT. MARIES HOUSE  KITCHEN  NIGHT 
 
Ahmad, Lucie, Lea and Fouad are sitting around the kitchen table and having dinner. A complete Iranian feast, which Ahmad has prepared. Fouad has cleaned his plate and turns to Ahmad. 
                 


                FOUAD          Can I have some more? 

 
Ahmad takes Fouads plate and serves him seconds. 
                 
                AHMAD 
         Did you like it? 
                 
                FOUAD 
         Very much! 

 
Ahmad also serves a second helping for Lea. He wants to reserve Lucies 
plate but she doesnt let him.  
                 
                LUCIE 
         No, its enough. 
                 
                AHMAD 
         Come one, have some. You wont get 
         real Ghormesabzi again soon. Unless 
         you two marry two nice Iranian guys... 
         and you, Fouad, an Iranian girl! 

 
Lea laughs. So does Fouad. 

                 
                LUCIE 
         How long will you stay? 

                 
                AHMAD 
         Where? 
                 
                LUCIE 
         Here. 

                 
                AHMAD  
         It depends on how long our talk will 
         last after dinner. 

                FOUAD 
                 ( a b r u p t l y )  
         What are Iranian girls like? 

                AHMAD 
         Iranian girls They look like me but 
         theyre girls! ( j o k i n g l y )  
         How does that sound?... Like this 

 
Ahmad jokingly takes on the mannerisms of a woman. Fouad and Lea laugh. 
                 
                LUCIE 
         What are we to talk about?  
                 
                AHMAD 
         Have your dinner and Ill tell you. 



EXT. MARIES HOUSE  BACKYARD  NIGHT 

Lucie is seated on the steps of the house leading down to the backyard. Ahmad pours some water on the ashes of the barbecue and places it in a corner. He picks up the cornhusks strewn on the ground and throws them away. While doing all this, he is speaking to Lucie. 
 

 

 

 

                AHMAD 
         You always come home so late? 
                 
                LUCIE 
         Just to sleep. 



                AHMAD 
         Why? 
                 
                LUCIE 
         I have nowhere else to spend the 
         night. 

                AHMAD 
         Why dont you want to sleep here? 
                 
                LUCIE 
         Same as you. Youd rather go to your 
         friends tomorrow. 

                AHMAD 
         This isnt my home. 
                 
                LUCIE 
         But your friends place is? 

 
Ahmad approaches Lucie and sits down next to her. 

 

 

                AHMAD 
         Im not comfortable here. 
                 
                LUCIE 
         Neither am I. 

                AHMAD 
         Its not the same. For me, its hard 
         to face the guy whos about to marry 
         my ex its only normal. 
                 
                LUCIE 
         Now, shesjust your ex? 



                AHMAD 
         Well, yes. 

                 

                LUCIE 
         Whatever. 

                AHMAD 
         What? 

                LUCIE 
        You lived here with her for years and 
         now shes just your ex?! 
                 
                AHMAD 
         Everythings changed since then. We 
         got separated Youre old enough to 
         understand that. 

 
Lucie gets up to leave. 

 

                LUCIE 
         Im old enough not to be preached at. 

                AHMAD 
         Im not here to preach. Your mom asked 
         me to talk to you and see whats got 
         into you. I dont know why she thinks 
         youd tell me more than you tell her. 
                 
                LUCIE 
         She knows perfectly whats got into 
         me. I dont want to see that jerk 
         whenever I come home.  

 
A long silence between them ensues. Lucie goes into the kitchen. 
                 
                AHMAD 
         Lucie, wait! 
                 

 
INT. MARIES HOUSE  KITCHEN  NIGHT 
 
Lucie wants to leave the kitchen. Ahmad comes into the kitchen from the backdoor. He wants her to stay. 

                AHMAD 
         Come and sit here. 

 
Lucie sits unwillingly. 

                 
                AHMAD 
         Isnt he a good guy? 

                LUCIE 
         I dont know him. 

 

 

                AHMAD 
         Why do you call him a jerk, then? What 
         has he done? 

                LUCIE 
         He hasnt done anything. He has 
         nothing to do here. 
                 
                AHMAD 
         Anyway, you have to accept the fact 
         that its your moms right to live 
         with whoever she wants. 

                LUCIE 
         Whoever she wants? Even a guy with a 
         kid and a wife in a coma? 
                 
                AHMAD 
                 ( c u r i o u s )  
         Fouads mom? 

 
Lucie nods. A moment of silence. 
 

                AHMAD 
         And if she married someone else, would 
         you mind? 

 

                 
                LUCIE 
         Itd be the same. 

                AHMAD 
         So your problem isnt him. 
                 
                LUCIE 
         No. 

                 
                AHMAD 
         Then, what is it? 

 
Lucie falls silent for a moment. Fighting back tears, she answers Ahmad. 

                 
                LUCIE 
         Im sixteen years old and since I was 
         born, my moms changed guys three 
         times. And its always the same story. 
         They come, stay for a few years, and 
         then they leave. 

 
Ahmad understands what Lucie means and has nothing to say in response. He too is upset. He gets up with the excuse of clearing the dishes. He has his back to Lucie. Perhaps to stop Lucie from seeing his reaction. And again there is silence. 

 

                 
                LUCIE 
         Would you talk to her? 

                AHMAD 
         About what? 
                 
                LUCIE 
         Talk her out of this marriage. 

 
Ahmad laughs at what Lucie has said; a bitter laugh. The sound of the front door opening is heard. 
 
INT. MARIES HOUSE  GROUND FLOOR  NIGHT 
 
Marie enters the house. From between the door to the childrens room she sees Fouad and Lea who are not yet sleeping and talking to each other. She is pressed to know if Lucie has come home. She throws her purse and coat on her bed and enters the kitchen. 
 


INT. MARIES HOUSE  KITCHEN  NIGHT  
Marie is elated to see Lucie. Lucie immediately gets up to leave the kitchen.  
 

                MARIE 
         Good evening. 
                 
                AHMAD 
         Good evening. 

 
Lucie mumbles to her mother. 
 

                LUCIE 
         Good night. 
                 
                AHMAD 
                ( i n   P e r s i a n )  
         Good night. 
                 
                LUCIE 
             ( i m i t a t i n g   A h m a d   a n d  
                i n   P e r s i a n )  
         Good night. 
                 
                MARIE 
         Lucie, can you sleep downstairs 
         tonight? Fouad will go up with Ahmad. 

                AHMAD 
         I kept you some food. Havent you had 
         dinner? 

                 
                MARIE 
         No. 

 
Lucie leaves. Marie sees the food that Ahmad has kept for her. She wasnt expecting Persian food. 
                 
                MARIE 
         Oh la la ! Thank you Where did you 
         get the herbs? 

 

                AHMAD 
         We went shopping with the kids. 

Marie sits at the table and starts to eat. Ahmad gets busy placing the dishes in the dishwasher. 

                 
                AHMAD 
         Do you want me to heat it up if its 
         cold? 

                 
                MARIE 
         No Youre still a great cook! 
                 
                AHMAD 
         The one thing Im stil great at. What 
         time must we be there tomorrow? 
                 

 



                MARIE 
         9  

                AHMAD 
         (Giving her a spoon) 
         You dont eat Ghormesabzi with a fork. 
                 
                MARIE 
         Did you talk to her?  
                 
                AHMAD 
         Yes 



                 
                MARIE 
         And? 

                AHMAD 
         You can guess. She doesnt like you 
         remarrying. 

                 
                AHMAD 
         Shes worried that youll live with 
         him for a while and that hell take 
         off. 

                 
                MARIE 
         Tell her to be sure that this one 
         wont leave. 

                AHMAD 
         I dont think Im the right person to 
         convince her to be happy youre 
         getting married. 

                MARIE 
                ( a   b i t   a n g r y )  
         I m not asking her to be happy. I 
         just want to know what shes after. 

                AHMAD 
         Stopping this marriage. 

 
Marie laughs nervously. 
 

                AHMAD 
         It made me laugh too. 

 
Marie now stops laughing while chewing the food she has in her mouth. Ahmad wants to leave. 

                 
                AHMAD 
         Try to convinve her before you make 
         your decision. 

                MARIE 
         My decisions made. 

 
Ahmad leaves the kitchen. While eating her food, Marie is deep in thought. 


 INT. MARIES HOUSE  UPSTAIRS BEDROOM  NIGHT 
 
The lights are out. Street light shines in through the window. Ahmad is lying down on the lower bunk and Fouad is on the top. Both are having trouble falling asleep. Fouad is looking at Ahmad from in between the spaces in the slats of his bed; Ahmads hand, Ahmads mouth. He is trying to find out if Ahmad is asleep, but he cant see his eyes. Fouad shifts restlessly. The bed squeaks. Ahmad hears him moving. 
                 
                AHMAD 
         Fouad? 

      
                FOUAD 
         Yes? 
                 
                AHMAD 
         If youre not comfy, we can switch 
         beds. 

                 
                FOUAD 
         Im ok. 

                 
                AHMAD 
         Then, why arent you asleep? 

 
Fouad does not answer. 

                 
                AHMAD 
         Close your eyes and go to sleep. 
                 
                FOUAD 
         I have to pee. 

 

                AHMAD 
         Go, then. Go... 

 
Fouad doesnt move, Ahmad realizes that he is afraid of going down by himself. He gets up to accompany him. 

INT. MARIES HOUSE  GROUND FLOOR  NIGHT 
 
Ahmad and Fouad walk downstairs towards the restroom. Ahmad turns on the light. Fouad goes inside and closes the door. Ahmad waits in the dark hallway for him to come out. Maries bedroom is next to the restroom. Ahmad notices the light pouring out from under Maries bedroom door. He hears a noise from inside the room. He strains to hear the muffled sounds of a conversation between two people. He is ill-at-ease. He doesnt want to stay there. He walks back upstairs. 
 
INT. MARIES HOUSE  UPSTAIRS ROOM  NIGHT 
 
Ahmad is distraught and cannot sleep. He is concerned that Fouad has not returned.  
 
INT. MARIES HOUSE  BEDROOM  NIGHT 
 
Samir is lying on the bed. Marie cradeling his head and putting eye drops into his eyes. As she is doing this, they are quietly speaking to each other. 

 



                MARIE 
                 ( q u i e t l y )    
         Did you talk to her doctor too? 
                 
                SAMIR 
         No, just the nurse. 

                MARIE 
         What did she say? 
                 
                SAMIR 
         About what? 
                 
                MARIE 
         The scratches on her stomach. 
                 
                SAMIR 
         They happened after my last two 
         visits. 

                 
                MARIE 
         Maybe it has nothing to do with your 
         visits. Maybe it was involuntary. 
                 
                SAMIR  
         Youd like it to be involuntary? 

Marie is shocked by what Samir has said. She closes the eye-drop bottle and sits on the edge of the bed. Samir closes his eyes to diminish the sting. From Maries silence, he realizes that he has upset her. 
 

                SAMIR 
         Im sorry.
                 
                MARIE 
         Do you hear yourself? You cant say 
         whatever you want and then just 
         apologize. 

 
Marie wants to continue the discussion but is interrupted by the sound of someone knocking on the door. Marie gets up and opens the door. Fouad is behind the door. It is clear that he is scared of the dark. 
                 
                MARIE 
         What are you doing here?  
                 
                FOUAD 
         Its dark. I cant go up. 
                 
                SAMIR 
         Why do you want to go up? 
                 
                MARIE 
         I asked him to go upstairs with Ahmad. 
         The girls are together. 
                 
                SAMIR 
         Maybe he is not comfortable sleeping 
         with a stranger. 

 
Samir gets up from the bed and comes towards Fouad. 
 

                SAMIR 
         Get your things. Were leaving. 
                 
                FOUAD 
         Im spleepy. I want to go to bed. 
                 
                SAMIR 
         You asked me to come get you! 

                FOUAD 
         I want to stay. 

                MARIE 
         You can sleep in my bed. 

 

 

 
Fouad lies down on Maries bed. Marie tucks him in. 

INT. MARIES HOUSE  KITCHEN AND HALLWAY  MORNING 

The next morning, Lucie, Lea and Fouad are sitting around the kitchen table finishing off their breakfast. The sink is full of water and clearly clogged. Ahmad is sitting on the floor and is busy opening the drainpipe under the sink. Marie who has taken a shower, enters the kitchen. 

 

 

                MARIE 
         Ahmad leave it were running late. 

                AHMAD 
         The sink is clogged. 

                MARIE 
         It can wait. We have to be there by 9. 
         Hurry up, kids. 

 
Marie leaves the kitchen. Ahmad opens the drainpipe. All the water from the sink pours into the bucket which Ahmad has placed underneath the sink. Ahmad clears the clogged pipe and dirties his hands in the process. Samir, who has just woken up, enters the kitchen.  
 


                SAMIR 
         Hi. 

 
Lea and Fouad answer him. Lucie ignores his presence. 
 

                SAMIR 
                 ( t o   A h m a d )  
         Morning Samir. 

 
Ahmad whose hands are dirty, gets up to greet him respectfully but does not offer his hand to shake. 
 

                AHMAD 
         My hands are dirty, sorry. 

 



                SAMIR 
         Its blocked again? 

                AHMAD 
         Its unblocked. Ill just screw it 
         back on. 

 
Samir joins the children seated at the kitchen table. As soon as he sits, Lucie grabs her last bite and without saying anything leaves the kitchen and walks in the hallway. She comes face-to-face with Marie who is getting dressed. 

 
         
                MARIE 
         Get ready, Lucie, well drop you off. 

                LUCIE 
         No need, Ill go by myself. 

 
Lucie goes to her room. Marie comes to the kitchen. Ahmad is still busy reattaching the drainpipe. Samir is eating his breakfast. Without sitting down at the table, Marie grabs a bite to eat. 
 

 

                MARIE 
         Ahmad, were late. 

                AHMAD 
         Its finished. 

 
Ahmad turns on the water to verify the pipe he has reattached does not leak. Marie notices Samir who is pretending to be busy with his breakfast. 
 

                MARIE 
                ( t o   t h e   k i d s )  
         Get moving, kids. 

 
Lea and Fouad finish their breakfasts and leave the kitchen to prepare for school. 
 



                AHMAD 
         Its leaking. 

                MARIE 
         Theres always been a leak. 

                SAMIR 
         I told you the joint has to be 
         changed. Ill take care of it. 
                 
                MARIE 
                 ( t o   A h m a d )  
         Did you eat anything? 

                SAMIR 
               ( t h i n k s   M a r i e   i s  
               t a l k i n g   t o   h i m )  
         Not yet. 


 
 

Ahmad turns off the tap. He takes the bucket from under the sink and leaves the kitchen. Marie and Samir are sitting at the table in the kitchen concentrating on their breakfasts. They are both quiet. 
 
INT. MARIES HOUSE  TOILET AND BATHROOM  MORNING 
 
Ahmad is ironing his shirt when Lucie gently opens the door and comes in to wash her hands. 
          
                LUCIE 
         Can I see you after? 

                AHMAD 
         Dont you have class? 

                LUCIE 
         I can skip. 

 
Marie cracks the bathroom door open. 
 

                MARIE 
         Ahmad! 
                 
                AHMAD 
                Coming         
	   ( t o   L u c i e )  
         What time do you get out of school? 
                 
               LUCIE 
         One. 

 
INT. MARIES HOUSE  THE ROOM FACING THE YARD  EXT. FRONT YARD  
MORNING 
 
Samir is wearing some work clothes and is standing on a step ladder painting a wall. As he paints, he looks out the window and sees Marie give the car keys to Ahmad. Samir has a strange feeling, as if seeing them together bothers him. Lucie comes into the room to get something. She has her backpack on her shoulder and is ready to go to school. She wasnt expecting to see Samir. Samir climbs down the ladder to help her and pulls the plastic cover away from her things. Without paying any attention to him, Lucie searches the computer desk for something and does not find it. This is a good excuse for Samir to start a 
conversation with her. 

 

                 
                SAMIR 
         Looking for something? 



                LUCIE 
         No. 

Lucie goes out. Samir is left alone. 
 
INT. SAMIRS CAR  EXT. STREET OUTSIDE LEAS SCHOOL  DAY  
 
Lea and Fouad are seated next to each other on the backseat. Ahmad is behind the wheel and Marie is sitting in the passengers seat. 
 

                MARIE 
         Go right. 

                AHMAD 
         Isnt that the school Lucie went to? 
                 
                MARIE 
         Yes. 

 
The car turns then stops in front of a schools main entrance. Lea gets out and Fouad follows her. 
 

                LEA 
              ( w h i l e   g e t t i n g   o u t )  
         Bye, Mommy. 

                MARIE

Marie cleans the corner of Fouads eye with her finger. Lea and Fouad 
go towards the school. The car drives off. 
 

                AHMAD 
         Where did you two meet? 

                MARIE 
         At the pharmacy, hed come in for his 
         wifes medication. 

                AHMAD 
         What was wrong with his wife? 

                MARIE 
         She was depressed. 

 
Ahmad smirks. Marie notices his reaction. 
 

                MARIE 
         What? 

                AHMAD 
         What? 

                MARIE 
               ( m i m i c s   A h m a d  s  
                  s m i r k )  
         Whats that supposed to mean? 

                AHMAD 
         We call it a smile. 

                MARIE 
         We call it mocking. Whats funny about 
         it? 


 
 

                AHMAD 
         Miss our fights, darling? 

                MARIE 
         Is her depression funny to you? 

 
Ahmad puts on the turning indicator and slowly pulls over. 
 

                AHMAD 
                 ( j o k i n g l y )  
         Look, if you start bugging me, Ill 
         get out right now and go back to 
         Tehran. I wont come to court and I 
         wont divorce you and then lets see 
         what you do. 

                MARIE 
         Its just your hair thats gone grey. 
         Nothing else has changed. 

                AHMAD 
         What should I do? Should I get out? 

                 MARIE 
         Stop joking, were late. 

 
Ahmad laughs and starts driving. 
 
INT. COURTHOUSE  HALLWAY  DAY  

Marie and Ahmad are sitting on a bench in a courthouse in the suburbs 
of Paris..  

 

 

                MARIE 
         Seriously, what did you think of him? 

                AHMAD 
         First tell me how serious all this is, 
         then Ill tell you what I think. 

                MARIE 
         Serious enough for me to be pregnant. 

 
Ahmad, who is clearly shocked at hearing this news, tries to hide his sadness and they both fall silent. The lawyer comes out of a room and calls Marie, who gets up. 
 

 

                AHMAD 
         Is that a joke? 



                MARIE 
         No. 
 
Marie enters the office accompanied by the lawyer. Ahmad lags behind Marie, he is deep in thought. 

 

 

 


INT. COURTHOUSE  ROOM  DAY   
Marie and Ahmad are sitting in front of the judges desk and their lawyer is seated between them. The judge reads their divorce agreement and asks for their consent, with that the administrative stage of their divorce is completed. During this procedure, Maries phone rings. She quietly speaks a few sentences without being heard. The judge looks at Marie with an expression that means she cannot speak on the phone. With no other choice, Marie hangs up the phone. 
                 
EXT. MARIES HOUSE  YARD  DAY 
 
Samir, who is still in his work clothes, is in the yard and is speaking on the phone. His hands are covered in paint. 
 

                SAMIR 
               ( o n   t h e   p h o n e )  
         Hello, Marie 

 
He hangs up, redials, then leaves a message. The airline company 
representative, who has delivered Ahmads suitcase, is holding some documents and waiting at the door. Ahmads damaged suitcase is on the ground, its locks have been broken. 
 

                SAMIR 
               ( o n   t h e   p h o n e )  
         Marie theyve brought the suitcase. 
         Its broken. I dont know if 
         somethings missing, if I should 
         accept it or not... Call me back. 
                 
Samir hangs up and goes towards the front door. 
 

                AIRLINE REPRESENTATIVE 
         Okay? 

                 
                SAMIR 
         What if somethings missing? 

                AIRLINE REPRESENTATIVE 
         Doesnt he have insurance? 
                 
                SAMIR 
         I dont know. 

                AIRLINE REPRESENTATIVE 
         What do we do, then? Will you take it 
         or should I bring it back to the 
         airport and he can come and follow up 
         on it? 

 
Samir goes towards the suitcase to pick it up. 
                 
                AIRLINE REPRESENTATIVE 
         Can you sign here? 

 
The airline representative notices Samirs eyes, which are wet and red. Samir signs. 

                 
                AIRLINE REPRESENTATIVE 
         Are you okay? 
                 
                SAMIR 
                ( s u r pr i s e d )  
         Why? 

                AIRLINE REPRESENTATIVE 
         Your eyes 

                 
                SAMIR 
         Oh! Im allergic to the paint. 

                AIRLINE REPRESENTATIVE 
               ( w h i l e   l e a v i n g )  
         Change jobs! 

 
The airline representative goes towards his car to get in. His words have put Samir deep in thought.  
                 
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE LUCIES SCHOOL  DAY

INT. SHAHRYARS RESTAURANT  DAY 
 
A typical neighborhood restaurant with an open kitchen located in the back where the chefs are busy cooking. The ambience of the restaurant is Italian. SHAHRYAR, the middle-aged and friendly owner, is taking a customers order. The restaurant is bustling, most of the tables are full of diners. Ahmad and Lucie enter the restaurant. They walk towards Shahryar who has not yet noticed them. 
                 
                AHMAD 
                ( i n   P e r s i a n )  
         Excuse me, wheres the bus stop to 
         Tajrish? 

 
Shahryar looks up. He is shocked to see Ahmad. 
 

                SHAHRYAR 
                ( i n   P e r s i a n )  
         What the hell are you doing here?! 

 
Shahryar gets up from behind the till and comes towards Ahmad. They both hug each other warmly and start joking and laughing.  
 

                AHMAD 
               ( i n   P e r s i a n   a n d  
              p o i n t i n g   t o   L u c i e )  
         Do you recognize her? 

                SHAHRYAR 
                ( i n   P e r s i a n )  
         Shes grown up. ( t o   L u c i e )  
         Do you remember when you were little, 
         hed put you on his bike and bring you

                AHMAD 
                ( i n   P e r s i a n )  
         That was Lea this is Lucie! Youve 
         always mixed them. 

                SHAHRYAR 
                ( i n   P e r s i a n )  
         How tall shes become. 
          

                 ( t o   L u c i e )  
         How are you? 

 

                LUCIE 
         Im good.
                 
                SHAHRYAR 
                ( i n   P e r s i a n )  
         You havent had lunch? 
                 
                AHMAD 
                ( i n   P e r s i a n )  
         Why else would we bother to come 
         here?! 

                SHAHRYAR 
                ( i n   P e r s i a n )  
         Sit, Ill be right with you. 

 
Ahmad and Lucie move towards a table to sit down, Shahryar walks 
towards the kitchen. Valeria, Shahryars Italian wife, is busy in the kitchen.. 
 

                SHAHRYAR 
                ( i n   I t a l i a n )  
         Valeria, your friends here. 

 
Valeria sees Ahmad. Ahmad walks towards her. She is happy to see Ahmad. 
 

                VALERIA 
                ( i n   P e r s i a n )  
         Ahmad Hello. How are you? 

                AHMAD 
                ( i n   P e r s i a n )  
         Hello, dear Valeria. 

                SHAHRYAR 
         You remember Lucie? 



                LUCIE 
         Hello. 
 

 

 

 

                VALERIA 
         Hello what a beautiful lady youve 
         become!... 

 
Valeria warmly embraces Lucie. 
 

                AHMAD 
         You two are still together? 

                SHAHRYAR 
                ( i n   P e r s i a n )  
         There is this tiny thing in common 
         between us to keep us from separating.  
                 
                AHMAD 
                ( i n   P e r s i a n )  
         What? 

                SHAHRYAR 
                ( i n   P e r s i a n )  
         The colors of our flags. 
                 
                AHMAD 
                ( t o   V a l e r i a )  
         What is he saying? 

                VALERIA 
         He talks too much let him. Hows your 
         mom? 

                LUCIE 
         Shes good. 

 

 

 
 
Valeria goes to the kitchen. Ahmad and Lucie sit at the table. Ahmad picks up the menu to look it over. 

                LUCIE 
         Did you go to court? 
                 
                AHMAD 
         Yes. 

                LUCIE 
         SO, its over now? 

 
                AHMAD 
         It was already over. You still like 
         ravioli?  

 
Ahmad sets the menu down. He notices Lucies sad eyes, staring off into the distance.  
 

                AHMAD 
         What is it? 

 
Lucie does not respond. 

                AHMAD 
         You know, this guy... I dont think 
         hes that bad... 

 
Lucie again does not respond. 
                 
                AHMAD 
         He must be going through a difficult 
         time. Put yourself in his shoes. 
         Between his wife and his concern for 
         his son... 

                LUCIE 
         How does she want to marry a married 
         man? 

                AHMAD 
         But you said his wifes in a coma. 

                LUCIE 
         But shes not dead; she might not die 

                AHMAD 
         Thats his problem. Thats no one 
         elses business 

                LUCIE 
         Do you know why his wifes in a coma? 

                AHMAD 
         No, how would I know? 

                LUCIE 
         My mom didnt tell you? 

                AHMAD 
         No. 

                LUCIE 
         She committed suicide. 

Ahmad is shocked by what Lucie is telling him. He remains silent 
saddened by what he has learned. 
 

                AHMAD 
         Because of her depression? 

 
Lucie, who has until now fought back her tears, suddenly loses control and start to cry. She tries to prevent the other diners from hearing her but many of them turn to see why she is crying. Ahmad tries to get her to calm down.  
 

                AHMAD 
                 ( q u i e t l y )  
         Lucie look at me 

 
Worried, Shahryar comes to their table. 
 

                SHAHRYAR 
         Whats the matter? 

 

                AHMAD 
         Lucie get up, well get some fresh 
         air. 

 
Ahmad takes Lucies hand and gets her up from the table.  
 

                SHAHRYAR 
        Take her to the back. 

 
Ahmad leads Lucie to the small back room of the restaurant where she can compose herself. Concerned by Lucies outburst, Valeria looks questioningly at Shahryar. Shahryar shrugs. 
 
INT. SHAHRYARS RESTAURANT  BACK ROOM  DAY 
 
A small room with a bed and Shahryars personal things. In a corner are boxes of soft drink, mineral water and food supplies. Ahmad sits Lucie down on the bed and unties her scarf and puts it aside. 
 

                LUCIE 
         Do you know why she doesnt tell 
         anyone that this guys wife has 
         committed suicide? 

                AHMAD 
         Calm down calm down for now, well 
         talk later. 
          

                LUCIE 
         Because she doesnt want anyone to 
         find out. 

                AHMAD 
         What? 
          

                LUCIE 
         That its because of their affair that 
         she tried to kill herself. 
          
 
Although hes shocked, but Ahmad pretends to not take Lucie seriously. 

                AHMAD 
         You shouldnt speak of these things 
         with such certainty especially at 
         your age. 

                 
                LUCIE 
         Then, dont say Ive grown up if you 
         dont think so. 

 
Lucie gets up to leave. Ahmad holds her and stops her. 
                 
                AHMAD 
         Sorry. 

 
Lucie sits down. More silence. 
          

                 
                LUCIE 
         I dont want them to be together. 

                AHMAD  
         You think its up to you and me? Im 
         nobody in this story. 
                 
                LUCIE 
         If they get married then Ill never 
         Ill never set foot in that house 
         again. 

                 
                AHMAD  
         Your mother is pregnant. 
          
Lucie looks at him in disbelief. 
                 
                LUCIE 
         Youre lying. 

 
Lucie, emotionally drained, stands up and leaves the room. Ahmad 
follows her. 
 

EXT. STREET OUTSIDE SHAHRYARS RESTAURANT  DAY  CONTINUED 
 
Lucie exits the restaurant and starts walking down the sidewalk. Ahmad walks next to her. 

                 
                AHMAD 
         Wait 

                LUCIE 
         You know why she went with that 
         asshole?... Cause he looks like you! 
         He reminds her of you! 

 
Ahmad has no answer to give Lucie. Lucie leaves. Ahmad stands there for a moment.  
 
INT. LIGHTING STORE  DAY                 
 
An old shop in Paris. A large number of old and new chandeliers and other lamps are hanging from the ceiling of the shop. All around the store are table lamps in various sizes and shapes. Samir and Marie are looking at the chandeliers hanging from the ceiling to pick something out. 

INT. SAMIRS CAR  EXT. STREET  DAY 
 
Several chandeliers and lamps are placed on the backseat. Samir is sitting behind the wheel and Marie in the front seat. They drive 
through the busy streets of Paris. Samir is deep in thought. Marie senses it and quietly waits for him to speak. Without looking at him, Marie gently reaches over to hold his hand and closes her eyes. A moment later, Samir has to remove his hand in order to shift gears. Marie opens her eyes. They drive on in silence. 
 
EXT. STREET  INT. RER STATION  NIGHT 
 
Ahmad comes up the stairs in a metro station. It is raining. He takes the gift he has bought out of its plastic bag and pulls the bag over his head to prevent his head from getting wet. He crosses the busy street, reaches the sidewalk and hugs the wall as he walks to stay as dry as possible. 


 INT. MARIES HOUSE  HALLWAY  NIGHT 
 
Marie walks towards the front door. She opens the door. Ahmad, who is 
soaked from the rain, comes inside. 
 


                AHMAD 
         Good evening. 

                MARIE 
         Youre soaked! 
                 
                AHMAD 
         It started pouring 
                 
                MARIE 
         Want a coffee? 

                 AHMAD 
         No, Ive just  come to get my 
         suitcase. I cant miss the last train. 

                MARIE 
         Its right here. At least, wait till 
         the rain stops. 
                 
                AHMAD 
         Its not stopping soon. 

 
Ahmads words have worried Marie even more. 
 


                AHMAD 
         Is Lucie back? 



                MARIE 
         No. 
 
Worried, Ahmad leans against the hallway wall.  
 

                MARIE 
         Watch the paint. 
          
Ahmad looks at his coat which is not stained with paint. He notices his suitcase in the hallway. He walks towards it and sees the lock is broken. 
 

                MARIE 
         It was broken when they delivered it. 
          

                 
                AHMAD 
         Did you call her friends? 

 

                MARIE 
         Ive called them so often looking for 
         her that Im embarrassed to do it 
         again. 
          
Ahmad finds his towel among the things in his suitcase and dries his face. He tries to close the suitcase but it will not close properly.  


                 MARIE 
         Did you talk to her today? 

                AHMAD 
         Yes. Can I have a piece of string or 
         something? 

                MARIE 
         You have a couple of suitcases left in 
         the shed. You can take one of them. 

                AHMAD 
         Are the kids sleeping? 



                MARIE 
         No. 
 
Marie goes inside. 
 
INT. MARIES YARD  SHED  NIGHT  
 
Ahmad is in the shed looking for his suitcases, which he had left there from a few years ago. From among the clutter piled up in a heap, he pulls out two dusty suitcases. He unzips the larger suitcase. Some clothing, a few black and white pictures of Ahmad from when he lived in Paris and other personal items are in the suitcase. Seeing his old belongings changes his mood. 

INT. MARIES HOUSE  KITCHEN  NIGHT  
 
Marie is standing by the window facing the backyard. The intensity of the rain can be seen. Samir is standing on the kitchen table and is installing a chandelier. Ahmad comes in the back kitchen door with his empty suitcase and heads towards the hallway. Marie and Samir briefly look at the suitcase hes holding. Ahmad leaves the kitchen in the dominating silence. 
 

                SAMIR 
         Turn it on, please. 

 
Marie walks towards the switch and turns on the light. The chandelier is lit up. Samir comes down from the table. He notices how restless Marie is. Ahmad enters the kitchen with the plastic bag holding the gifts he has brought from Tehran and the gift he has bought for Fouad. He places the gifts on the kitchen table and sits down. 
 

                AHMAD 
         Will you tell the kids to come here 
         before they go to sleep, so that I can 
         give them their gifts? 

 
Marie is about to leave the kitchen. 
 

 

                MARIE 
         Should Fouad come too? 



                AHMAD 
         Of course. 
              


                SAMIR 
         But, he wasnt supposed to get one. 
                 
                AHMAD 
         I got him something today. 

                SAMIR 
         Can I ask you not give it to him? 

                AHMAD 
                ( b e w i l d e r e d )  
         Why? 

 
Marie is also astonished and is looking at Samir. 
 

 

                SAMIR 
         Hes done something wrong. He needs to 
         be punished 

                 
                MARIE 
         They should both be punished, then. 
          

                SAMIR 
         I can only speak for my son. 

 
Samirs words have upset Marie. 
 

                AHMAD 
         Whatve they done? 

 
                 SAMIR 
         They took the gift out of your 
         suitcase. 

                AHMAD 
                 ( l a u g h i n g )  
         But the gift was still in there. 
          

                SAMIR 
         I put it back. But we cant let them 
         off the hook. 

                AHMAD 
         The suitcase was open, they got 
         tempted 

                MARIE 
             ( i m p a t i e n t l y   w a n t i n g  
                 t o   l e a v e )  
         Ill ask them to apologize.  

                SAMIR 
         This way theyll learn that there will 
         always be a way to get away with any 
         situation by apologizing.  

                AHMAD 
         But Ive already told them Ive 
         brought gifts I cant pretend now I 
         didnt. 

                MARIE 
                 ( t o   S a m i r ,  
                f r u s t r a t e d )  
         Can you please let go? Ive already 
         scolded them enough. 
          

                SAMIR 
                ( a   b i t   u p s e t )  
         I was just asking if it was possible. 

 
Ahmad is in a dilemma. He doesnt know how to respond, but Marie goes to get the kids. Ahmad and Samir are standing opposite each other in the kitchen. There is silence and the tension between them is palpable. They avoid making eye contact with one another. Samir cannot stand this situation any longer and gets up from the table with the excuse of closing the window that Marie had left open when she was smoking her cigarette. He sees the light in the shed, which Ahmad has left on. He passes through the backyard in the rain and turns off the light in the shed and comes back to the kitchen. Marie enters the kitchen with Lea and Fouad.  
 

 

                LEA 
         Good evening. 

                FOUAD 
         Good evening. 
          

                AHMAD 
                 ( f r i e n d l y )  
         Good evening, kids. 

 
Ahmad takes the plastic bag to take out the gifts. 
 

                MARIE 
         No, first you both have to apologize. 
                 
                LEA 
         I apologize. 

 
Everyone is waiting for Fouad to apologize but he is quiet. 
 



                SAMIR 
         And you? 

                FOUAD 
         I didnt take it from the suitcase. 

                SAMIR 
         But you were with her when she did it. 

                FOUAD 
         But I didnt take it. 

                SAMIR 
         It doesnt matter who took it. You 
         were together, you couldve stopped 
         her.  

 
Fouad is silent and does not respond. Angry, Samir stands up, walks towards him and stares into his eyes. Ahmad is uncomfortable. 
 
                SAMIR 
         I apologize. 
                 
                FOUAD 
                ( r e l u c t a n t l y )  
         I apologize. 

                SAMIR 
               ( c o m m a n d i n g l y )  
         I apologize! 

                FOUAD 
               ( w i t h   n o   o t h e r  
                  c h o i c e )  
         I apologize. 

 
Samir goes back to his seat and sits down. Ahmad gives Lea and Fouad the two boxes. For Lea a remote controlled helicopter and for Fouad a giftwrapped box. The children thank him but they are not very pleased with the scolding they have received. 
 
 
INT. MARIES HOUSE  CHILDRENS ROOM  NIGHT 
 
Lea and Fouad are in their beds. 
 



                LEA 
         You pretended like it was me. 

                FOUAD 
         I just said I didnt take it. 

                LEA 
         That means it was me! 

                FOUAD 
         It was you. 

                LEA 
         But you told me his suitcase was open. 
         Otherwise, I wouldnt have gone. 
                 
                FOUAD 
         You didnt have to listen. You didnt 
         have to go. 

                LEA 
         I know why youre mad. You didnt get 
         a helicopter. You got colored pencils. 



                FOUAD 
         Shut up! 

                LEA 
         Youre crazy. 



                FOUAD 
         Shut up! 

                LEA 
         Youre insane. 

                FOUAD 
         Shut up! 
          

 
Lea is upset at him. She gets up, takes her blanket and leaves the room to sleep in another room. 
 
INT. MARIES HOUSE  KITCHEN  NIGHT  
 
Marie holds the dress which Ahmad brought for her up to her body and shows it to Ahmad and Samir. Both men are looking at Marie. 
 

                AHMAD 
         I got the size you used to wear. 

                MARIE 
         It still wear the same size. 
          

                AHMAD 
         I have a gift for Lucie too. Ill give 
         it to her later. 

                MARIE 
         Shes never been so late. 

 
Samir gets up from the table. 
 

 

                SAMIR 
         Ill go look for her. 

                 
                MARIE 
         Where? 

                SAMIR 
         I dont know nearby in the streets, 
         at the station where are the keys? 

                MARIE 
         You had them. 

                AHMAD 
         Can I come with you, if you dont 
         mind? 

                SAMIR 
               ( w i t h   n o   o t h e r  
                  c h o i c e )  
         Sure. If you want. 


 Samir leaves the kitchen. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

                AHMAD 
         She might not want to come back with 
         him. 

                MARIE 
         Why did she cry at the restaurant 
         today? 

                AHMAD 
         Who told you? 

                MARIE 
         I called Shahryar and he said she 
         suddenly burst ito tears. Shes never 
         been this late. What have you told her 
         that has made her stay out until now? 

                AHMAD 
                 ( c a l m l y )  
         You hadnt told her you were pregnant? 

                MARIE 
                 ( w o r r i e d )  
         You did? 

                AHMAD 
         I thought shed let it go if she knew 
          

                MARIE 
         Thats why shes not back. You werent 
         supposed to tell her. 

                AHMAD 
         I didnt know. What kind of secret is 
         that, anyway? Shed have found out 
         someday! 

                MARIE 
         Not when shes so upset. 

                AHMAD 
         Her problem is not your being 
         pregnant. 

                MARIE 
         What is her problem? 

 
Ahmad seems reluctant to answer. Marie stands in front of him, waiting for a reply. 
 

                MARIE 
                ( a   b i t   u p s e t )  
         Whats her problem?... huh? 

                AHMAD 
               ( w i t h   n o   o t h e r  
                  c h o i c e )  
         She seems to know everything. 

                MARIE 
         Everything about what? 

 
Samir comes to the kitchen door. 
 

 

                SAMIR 
         I cant find the keys. 

                MARIE 
                  ( a n g r y )  
         Well, look for them! 

 
Samir is surprised to see Marie so up. Ahmad is visibly uncomfortable. 

 

 

                AHMAD 
         Well talk later. 

                MARIE  
         What do you mean by knowing 
         everything? I dont understand. 

                AHMAD 
         She says that his wife committed 
         suicide because of your affair. 

 
Marie gets even angrier upon hearing this. Ahmad, who feels that he has said what he needed to say, tries again to leave. 
 

                MARIE 
         She committed suicide because 

 

                AHMAD 
         Ill call you tomorrow and we can 
         speak then. 
          
Samir enters the kitchen to take his coat. 

 


                MARIE 
                 ( a n g r i e r )  
         The keys are not here. 

                SAMIR 
         I got them. 

                MARIE 
         So why you are here? 

                SAMIR 
         What do you mean? Does somebody mind 
         my being here? 





                MARIE 
         No, but 
                 
                SAMIR 
         Forget it. 
 

 

 


 Samir leaves the house and Ahmad tries to go outside with him. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

                AHMAD 
                 ( t o   S a m i r )  
         Wait, Im coming. 

                MARIE 
         Ahmad his wife had been depressed for 
         some time. 

                MARIE 
         Every time Id take my clothes there, 
         Id see her You could tell that she 
         was unwell. 
          

                AHMAD 
         Why was she unwell? 

                MARIE 
         What do you mean why? 

                AHMAD 
         Nothing, forget it. 

                MARIE 
         Look, either dont say something or if 
         you do, say it clearly. 

                AHMAD 
         You said every time you saw her, she 
         felt unwell... 

                MARIE 
         I didnt say she felt unwell, I said 
         she was unwell! 

                AHMAD 
         Forget it. This is just getting worse. 

                MARIE 
                 ( q u i e t l y )  
         Youd really like to hear that it was 
         my fault if that woman committed 
         suicide? 

                AHMAD 
                 ( q u i e t l y )  
         I dont want to hear anything. You 
         asked me to go and talk to your 
         daughter. Im just telling what she 
         thinks. Thats all. 

                MARIE 
         Shes wrong. She must come and have a 
         conversation with me and Ill tell 
         her. 

                AHMAD 
         Do you want to tell her what you told 
         me?  Do you think shes going to buy 
         that? 

                MARIE 
         Dont you believe me? 

                AHMAD 
         Does that matter? Shes the one who... 

                MARIE 
         Whats so unbelievable about it? 

                AHMAD 
         I also find it hard to believe that 
         the mother of a five-year-old would 
         commit suicide because of depression. 

                MARIE 
         Look whos talking! Have you forgotten 
         the state you were in? This woman 
         committed suicide another time when 
         her baby was nine-month-old! Was it 
         also my fault? I was with you, back 
         then! 

 
Ahmad falls silent upon hearing this. 
 

                MARIE 
         Her depression started right after the 
         birth. Do you want to know what meds 
         Samir would come and get for her? 

INT. AND EXT. SAMIRS CAR  NIGHT  
 
Ahmad and Samir are in the car, driving up and down the streets of their neighborhood searching for Lucie. 
 

 

 

                SAMIR 
         How long are you staying in town? 

                AHMAD 
         I havent booked my return yet. 

                SAMIR 
         Couldnt you have sent a lawyer to 
         take care of the divorce instead of 
         coming all this way? 

                AHMAD 
         Sure, but I wanted to come. I wanted 
         to see the kids, and Marie-Anne too... 
         to end on good terms. 
                 
                SAMIR 
         But it doesnt seem to be the end. 
         Theres still something going on. 
          

                AHMAD 
         No What makes you think that? 


                SAMIR 
         When two people meet four years later 
         and start fighting again, it means 
         things are still unresolved. 

                AHMAD 
         We were arguing about Lucie. 

 
They are both quiet now, searching the streets in silence. 
 

 
 

                SAMIR 
         Lucies problem is me. 

                AHMAD 
         No its a misunderstanding. 

                SAMIR 
         About what? 

 
Ahmad does not wish to answer. 
 

 


                SAMIR 
         Anything personal that I shouldnt 
         know? 



                AHMAD 
         No... 
                 
                SAMIR 
         I that case, I want you to tell me... 
         You may know Marie is carrying my 
         child. Its not good for her to be 
         stressed out all the time, smoking so 
         many cigarettes... 

                AHMAD 
         Im worried about her too. She didnt 
         use to smoke. 
                 
                SAMIR 
         I wont let this girl destroy her 
         mother. If she has a problem, she 

                AHMAD 
         She has no problem. I told you, its a 
         misunderstanding. 

                SAMIR 
         What is this fucking misunderstanding 
         that has been screwing our lives for 
         months? 

                AHMAD 
         Marie-Anne can tell you. 

                SAMIR 
         Leave her out of this. 

                AHMAD 
         She is making assumptions about your 
         wife. 

                SAMIR 
         She thinks she committed suicide 
         because of our relationship? 

                AHMAD 
         So you know... 
                 
                SAMIR 
         I overheard your conversation. 



                AHMAD 
         Did you? 

                SAMIR 
         She did that because of a stupid story 
         with a customer. 

                AHMAD 
         I heard she was depressed. 

                SAMIR 
         Otherwise, she wouldnt have tried to 
         kill herself for nothing. What can I 
         do if Lucie doesnt believe me?  
         I can send her my employee. She saw 
         the whole thing. 

INT. MARIES HOUSE  GROUND FLOOR  NIGHT 
 
Samir and Ahmad enter the house through the front door. Marie hears the door open. Curious and restless, she comes out of the bedroom. From Samir and Ahmads expression, she realizes that their search has been fruitless. Samir places the umbrella in a corner and walks in. 
 

                SAMIR 
         We should call the police. They may 
         find her. 

 
Concerned, Ahmad stands in the doorway. Marie approaches him. 
 

                AHMAD 
         Has she already stayed out all night? 



                MARIE 
         No, its the first time. 
                 
                SAMIR 
         Maybe she went to her fathers. 

                MARIE 
         To Brussels? 

                 
                AHMAD 
         Hes not in Paris anymore? 

                MARIE 
        No, hes back in Brussels. 

                 
                SAMIR 
         You think she can be there? 

                MARIE 
                 ( d o u b t f u l )  
         Shes on bad terms with him too. 

                SAMIR 
         Do you want me to call? 

                MARIE 
                 ( t o   A h a m d )  
         Its better if you do it. 

 
Samir brushes past Marie and goes to the bedroom. Ahmad is 
uncomfortable with the request Marie has made. 
 

                AHMAD  
         I doubt shed have gone to Brussels. 

 
Marie notices that Ahmad would perfer not to call Lucies father. 
 

                MARIE 
                  ( u p s e t )  
         Fine, Ill do it. 

                AHMAD 
         Ok, give me his number. 

 
Marie goes to get the number. 
                 
                MARIE 
         Shahryar called twice. He wants you to 
         call him back. 


                AHMAD 
         Wheres the phone? 

                MARIE 
         In the kitchen. 

 
Ahmad goes to the kitchen. 
 
INT. MARIES HOUSE  BEDROOM  NIGHT 
 
Lea is lying down under the blanket on her mothers bed. Samir is feeling down and is seated on the edge of the bed. Marie comes in, worried. She is looking for her address book. Everyone is quiet. Marie sees that Samir is deep in thought, he running his fingers through his hair.  
 

 

 

                SAMIR 
         Where did she get this idea? 



                MARIE 
         What idea? 

 
 

                SAMIR 
         About Celines suicide. 

                MARIE 
         I dont know 

Marie finds her address book and starts to leave the bedroom. Before exiting, she realizes that her reaction has upset Samir. She walks towards Samir and sits next to him affectionately. Lea, who has not yet fallen asleep, turns around and sees their backs facing her. Samir takes the eye-drops and drops some medication into his eyes. 
 
57. INT. MARIES HOUSE  KITCHEN AND HALLWAY  NIGHT  
 
Ahmad is holding the phone and speaking to Shahryar. 
 

                AHMAD 
                ( i n   P e r s i a n )  
         Okay, thanks.... Okay, I will... Bye. 

 
Marie is standing there holding the phonebook and is waiting for Ahmad to get off the phone to give him the number. 


                MARIE 
         Here. 

                AHMAD 
         What is it? 

 

                MARIE 
         Her fathers number. But try not to 
         worry him. Hes fragile... 

                AHMAD 
         Shes at Shahryars. 

 
Marie is shocked and quiet. 
 

                AHMAD 
         She went to the restaurant and he took 
         her in. 

 
Marie, who until now had tried to control herself, suddenly becomes 
angry.  

 

 

                MARIE 
         But he called twice! Why didnt he 
         tell me? He heard how worried I was! 
         Why didnt he tell me? Ive been 
         worried sick all night! 

                AHMAD 
         Ill explain. 

                MARIE 
                 ( s h o u t i n g )  
         Explain what? What do you want to 
         explain? 

Samir, curious about the commotion, comes into the kitchen. 


                SAMIR 
         Whats the matter? 



                AHMAD 
         Nothing. 

                SAMIR 
                 ( f i r m l y )  
         Ive already asked you to go through 
         me!  

                 
                AHMAD 
              ( e v e n   m o r e   f i r m l y )  
         And I ask you not to raise your voice 
         in front of me okay? 

 
Suddenly, everyone is quiet. Samir tries to control himself. 

 

                MARIE 
         Why didnt he tell me she was there? 
          
                SAMIR 
         Who? 

                AHMAD 
                 ( t o   M a r i e )  
         Lucie made him promise. 
                 
                SAMIR 
         He promised to hide a sixteen-year-old 
         girl in his house and not tell anyone? 

                AHMAD 
         What do you mean hide?! 

                SAMIR 
                 ( n e r v o u s )  
         Why has he taken her to his house? 

                AHMAD 
         He felt sorry for her. 
                 
                SAMIR 
         Didnt he feel sorry for her mother?!   

 
Ahmad holds his tongue not to start a fight. Marie suddenly gets up to leave the kitchen. She takes a few steps and as if forgetting something, she comes back. 
 


                MARIE 
                 ( t o   S a m i r )  
         The keys. 

                SAMIR 
         Where are you going? 

                MARIE 
         She has to come back home. 


 



                AHMAD 
         Marie 

                MARIE 
         She has to come here, sit her ass down 
         and listen! 


                AHMAD 
         Now? 

                MARIE 
         Right now! 

                AHMAD 
         She thinks we dont know shes there. 

                MARIE 
         I dont care! I want her to come and 
         see the mess shes put me in! I want 
         her to know that I didnt cause this 
         womans suicide! 

 
Fouad, standing in the doorway, has heard everything.  
 
INT. MARIES HOUSE  BEDROOM  NIGHT  
 
Marie rushes to put on her raincoat. Samir is standing next to the door and Lea is on the bed. Although her eyes are closed, it is clear that she is not sleeping. 
 

                SAMIR 
         If you go to get her now, she wont 
         come home with you. 
                 
                MARIE 
                  ( a n g r y )  
         Then, Ill call the police to bring 
         her back. I swear I will. 

                SAMIR 
         The police will bring her back one 
         night. What about tomorrow night? 

 

 

                MARIE 
         Either she comes back here or she goes 
         and lives with her father in Brussels. 

 
Marie comes towards the door to leave. Samir blocks her path. 
 

                SAMIR 
         She wont come back as long as Im 
         here. 

 

 
They stare at each other in silence. 

INT. SHAHRYARS HOUSE  NIGHT 
 
The house is mostly dark, only one light is on in the kitchen. 
Shahryars house is not very large. It has been decorated like an Iranian home. The television is on and Shahryar is sitting on a sofa opposite it. He is watching a football game. Two commentators fiercely debating a referee call. They each present their own points of view. The penalty sequence is repeated several times in slow motion and graphics. The referees call cannot be confirmed. The doorbell ringing interrupts the sound of the show. Shahryar gets up and walks towards the door. He opens the door for Ahmad. Ahmad walks in with his suitcase. Both men speak quietly. 
 

 

 


 

                AHMAD 
                ( i n   P e r s i a n )  
         Hello. 

                SHAHRYAR 
                ( i n   P e r s i a n )  
         Hello come in. 

                AHMAD 
                ( i n   P e r s i a n )  
         Is she up? 

                SHAHRYAR 
                ( i n   P e r s i a n )  
         She has fallen asleep come in. 
          

                SHAHRYAR 
         Hardly here and already in trouble. 
                 
                AHMAD 
         When did she come to you? 

                SHAHRYAR 
         It was late. I thought she had come 
         looking for you. 

                AHMAD 
         You should have called right then. Her 
         mother was so worried. 

                SHAHRYAR 
         How can I call you?  You dont have a 
         phone! I called the house looking for 
         you but you werent there. I was 
         afraid if I told her mother, that she 
         would find out and leave in the middle 
         of the night Whats wrong with her? 

                AHMAD 
         Shes imagining things. 

 
 

INT. SHAHRIARS HOUSE  BEDROOM  NIGHT  
 
Without making any noise, Ahmad turns on the dim bedside lamp which is near Lucies bed. He wants to gently wake Lucie up. He is still unsure but without a choice, puts his hand on her shoulder and gently shakes her. 
 



                AHMAD 
         Lucie 

 Lucie opens her eyes and is surprised to see Ahmad next to her bed. 
 

                AHMAD 
         Sorry to wake you your mom is waiting 
         for you. 

 
Lucie who it seems has just realized where she is, is staring at Ahmad without saying anything. 
 

                AHMAD 
         She wanted to come and get you. I 
         asked her to not come, I promised I 
         would take you back. Come on, get up. 

 
Lucie sits up. 
 

                AHMAD 
         Wheres your jacket? 

 
Lucie has only now realized what is happening. 
 

                LUCIE 
         I wont go. I dont wanna go back 
         tonight. 

 
Lucies pleas leave Ahmad less certain. He doesnt know what to do. 
 

                AHMAD 
         Then Ill call her and you can tell 
         her that youll go back tomorrow 
         morning, okay? 

 
Lucie doesnt respond. Ahmad leaves the room to get the phone. Lucie is sitting on the edge of the bed by herself. Ahmad comes back with the phone and dials a number and waits. 
 

                AHMAD 
               ( o n   t h e   p h o n e )  
         Marie-Anne? Hold on, please. 

 
He gives the phone to Lucie and signals to her to speak. 
 

                LUCIE 
               ( o n   t h e   p h o n e )  
         Yes?... Im staying here tonight. 

 
She listens for a long time to the other end. From Lucies face, it is clear that her mother is speaking relentlessly and perhaps threatening her. Lucie still does not speak. Ahmad is worried and is looking at her. Marie has said what she wanted to say and hangs up. 
 


                AHMAD 
         Why did you hang up? 

                LUCIE 
         She did. 

                AHMAD 
         Lets go.

 


                LUCIE 
         No. 

                AHMAD 
         Get out of bed. Lets go talk. 

 
INT. SHAHRYARS HOUSE  KITCHEN  NIGHT 
 
Ahmad closes the kitchen door behind him. Lucie goes to the sink and washes her face. Ahmad sits at the table and waits for her. Lucie sits at the table opposite him. 
 

 


                AHMAD 
         I want you to listen carefully. I 
         dont know how much you remember of 
         the last few months I was living with 
         your mother. Do you remember anything? 
                 
                LUCIE 
         Uhum. 

                 
                AHMAD 
         Do you remember the state I was in? 
                 
                LUCIE 
         Yes. 

                AHMAD 
         I was always feeling down. I wasnt 
         working, I stopped going out, I just 
         didnt want to exist anymore. So, when 
         your mom says that woman committed 
         suicide because she was depressed, I 
         can understand what it means. Even 
         with a young child... 
                 
                LUCIE 
         Did you often think of killing 
         yourself? 

                AHMAD 
         Yes, sometimes? 
                 
                LUCIE 
         You never thought of drinking 
         detergent in front of Lea and me to 
         die? 

                 
                AHMAD 
                 ( s h o c k e d )  
         What? No! 

                 
                LUCIE 
         You think that a woman who goes to her 
         husbands shop and downs a bottle of 
         detergent in front of her son and 
         collapses only means to die? 

 
Ahmad is silent. Lucie is trying not to burst into tears as she did earlier that day before finishing what she had to say. 



                LUCIE 
         Why didnt she take pills and die in 
         her bed? 

                AHMAD 
         Look, we can spend the night imagining 
         things. But its all speculation. 
         Well see Samirs employee tomorrow. 
         She has things to tell you. 

 
Lucie is struggling to maintain her composure. Ahmad is deep in 
thought. Theres a brief silence between them. 
 
INT. MARIES HOUSE  GROUND FLOOR  MORNING 
 
Fouad is dressed, he takes his toothbrush from among the other 
toothbrushes and comes out of the bathroom. 
 
INT. MARIES HOUSE  KITCHEN  MORNING 
 
Marie and Samir are in each others arms, lovingly. 
                 
                SAMIR 
         Tell her Ive left and she can come 
         back. Its better if Fouad and I dont 
         stay here for a while. 

 
Marie pulls herself away from Samirs embrace. Samir leaves the kitchen. Marie remains alone in the kitchen  

INT. METRO CAR  DAY 
  
Samir and his son are sitting next to each other towards the back of a metro car. The metro approaches a station. Samir takes Fouads bag and goes towards the exit door. Fouad is sitting stubbornly in his seat. The door opens and Samir gets off assuming that Fouad is behind him. Suddenly he realizes that Fouad has not gotten off. Scared, he quickly returns to the car and runs towards Fouad. 
                 
                SAMIR 
         Come on, lets go! 

 
Fouad is being stubborn. Samir takes his hand. Fouad resist but Samir manages to take him out of the car by force and drags him over to the wall for a serious talk. 
 

 

 

 

                SAMIR 
         What is that about? Why dont you get 
         off? Look at me! 

                FOUAD 
         I want to go back to Maries. 

                SAMIR 
         We have to go home for now. 

                FOUAD 
         You told me our home was there, 
         forever. 



 

                SAMIR 
         Yes, but some things have changed. 

                FOUAD 
         Its because of the man who came? 

 
Samir does not respond. 
 
 


 

                FOUAD 
         Because I misbehaved yesterday? 

                SAMIR 
         No. 

                FOUAD 
         Why doesnt Lucie like you? 

                SAMIR 
         Because she thinks I want to take her 
         mommy away from her. 

                FOUAD 
         But she doesnt like her mommy. 

                SAMIR 
         Of course she does. All children love 
         their mommies. Just like you miss your 
         mommy. 

                FOUAD 
         But Mommys not home anymore. 

                SAMIR 
         Would you like to go see her? Do you 
         want to go to see her tomorrow? 

                FOUAD 
         No. 

                SAMIR 
         Why? 

                FOUAD 
         She scares me. 

                SAMIR 
         Your mommy? 

                FOUAD 
         Shes dead. 

                SAMIR 
         Dont say such things, Fouad. If she 
         was dead, they wouldnt have kept her 
         in the hospital, with the machines. 

                FOUAD 
         If they take them away, shell die? 
         Why dont they take them away? 

                SAMIR 
         Because we dont know if she wants to 
         stay alive like this or if she wants 
         to die. 

                FOUAD 
         She wants to die. 

                SAMIR 
                 ( s h o c k e d )  
         Why do you say that? 
                 
                FOUAD 
         She killed herself. It means that she 
         wanted to die. 

 
Fouads words have upset Samir. He hug Fouad.  
 

                FOUAD 
         Sorry, Daddy. 

INT. SHAHRIARS RESTAURANT  DAY 
  
Naima is seated at one of the tables in the restaurant. Her gaze 
reveals her state of anxiety. Ahmad and Lucie are seated opposite her and they watch her curiously. 
                 
                AHMAD 
         Did his wife work there too? 

                NAIMA 
         Yes, for a few days. Samir had brought 
         her to clear her head. 

Naima takes the garment out from its cover and places it in front of Ahmad and Lucie. 
 

                NAIMA 
         And that day, she had a fight with a 
         customer over this stain. The customer 
         said that the dress had been stained 
         at the cleaners. Samirs wife said 
         no, it had it before it was brought in 
         to the cleaners. 

                AHMAD 
         Thats all? 

                NAIMA 
         To make things better, I told her to 
         leave the dress and come and get it 
         the next day. The customer said that 
         the next day would be too late, 
         because the dress belonged to a guest 
         of the hotel where she worked and the 
         guest was catching a flight that 
         afternoon. She said we had a couple of 
         hours to get the stain out and I said 
         okay Suddenly Celine started 
         screaming at me, saying it wasnt for 
         me to say, that this dress had the 
         stain before we got it and its not 
         our problem. The customer started 
         yelling and even cursed. Samirs wife 
         got upset and threw the dress on the 
         sidewalk. I didnt know what to do 
         They pushed each other around a bit, 
         and the customer decided to call the 
         police So I asked her to let me leave 
         so that when the police comes, I 
         wouldnt be there 

                AHMAD 
         You work illegally?  

                NAIMA 
         Yes. But Cline said you have to stay 
         and tell the police that when you got 
         the dress, it was already stained. So 
         I called Samir without her seeing me 
         to and asked him to come quickly. When 
         he came and heard the story, he got 
         very angry with his wife and said 
         sorry to the customer and said hed 
         pay for the dress. He asked her to 
         call the police and tell them that the 
         issue was resolved. The customer said 
         shed do it only if his wife 
         apologized to her. And then Celine 
         started screaming and yelling at me 
         saying I had no right to call Samir 
         behind her back. I didnt say 
         anything. I just took my purse to 
         leave, but Samir came and took my 
         hand, like this... He said I had to 
         stay. Instead, he asked his wife to 
         leave. In front of the customer, in 
         front of me, he threw her out and I 
         stayed. 

 
Now all three are quiet. Upset, Ahmad looks at the stain at the back of 
the dress and Lucie stares at Naima who is upset. 
          

 

                AHMAD 
         How many days before her suicide was 
         that? 

                NAIMA 
         I think four or five days... Can I go? 

                AHMAD 
         Thank you. 
 
Naima gets up. She takes the dress, says goodbye and leaves. Ahmad gets up and accompanies her to the door. Lucie is still seated, lost in thought. Ahmad returns to the table. 
 


 
 

 

 

                AHMAD 
         Thats what depressions like. Small 
         things can suddelnly set you off. 

                LUCIE 
               ( o n   t h e   v e r g e   o f  
                  t e a r s )  
         The day before her suicide, I 
         forwarded her all the love letters my 
         mom and Samir had emailed each other. 

 
Ahmad is astonished. He is looking in disbelief at Lucie who has now revealed her secret and does not even have the energy to cry. There is silence between them.  
 
EXT. SHAHRYARS RESTAURANT  SIDEWALK  DAY 
 
Lucie exits the restaurant. They stand on the sidewalk together, she is 
upset and looking at Ahmad. 


                AHMAD 
         What are you going to do now? 

                LUCIE 
         Ill go to Brussels. 

                AHMAD 
         Dont be silly. You wont last a 
         minute there. You have to go back to 
         your moms. 

                LUCIE 
         I cant wake up every morning and face 
         the guy whose wife is dead because of 
         me!I cant look his son in the eyes. 

                AHMAD 
         Come sit down. 

 
Ahmad seats Lucie down on the chair in front of the restaurant. He sits opposite her. 

                 
                AHMAD 
         Do you want me to help you? 

                LUCIE 
                 ( w o r r i e d )  
         Youre not going to tell my mom... 



                AHMAD 
         Listen 

                LUCIE 
                 ( f r a n t i c )  
         No, I dont want her to know. 



                AHMAD 
         Sit down! 
 

 
Lucie gets up. 
 

 


                LUCIE 
         I shouldnt have told you. 

                AHMAD 
         Hold on, listen You either keep this 
         to yourself and suffer for the rest of 
         your life, or you talk to your mom. 

                LUCIE 
         Whatd that chage? 

                AHMAD 
         It might change her decision to marry 
         him. 

                LUCIE 
         He decisions made, shes pregnant. 

                AHMAD 
         What if she finds out about this after 
         her child is born? Then, itd really 
         be too late. 

                LUCIE 
         If Id felt like telling her, I 
         wouldve done it. 
                 
                AHMAD 
         Its not about you feeling like it or 
         not. You have to ask yourself if it is 
         important for your mother. She has the 
         right to know. 

 
INT. MARIES HOUSE  KITCHEN  HALLWAY  DAY 
 
Marie is busy putting away the groceries. From the hallway, Ahmad quietly stands in the kitchen doorway. Marie doesnt notice his presence. She turns around, sees him standing behind her. She is startled, screams, then laughs at her own reaction. 
 

 

                MARIE 
         Youre here? 

                AHMAD 
         I was upstairs with Lucie. 

 
Ahmad comes into the kitchen. 
 


 

                MARIE 
         How was your meeting? 

                AHMAD 
         What meeting? 

                MARIE 
         With Samirs employee. 

                AHMAD 
         Yeah. It was fine. 


 Ahmad helps Marie put away the groceries. 
 

                AHMAD 
         Had you told Lucie I was coming to 
         Paris? 

                MARIE 
         No. 

                AHMAD 
         How did she know, then? 

                MARIE 
         Did she know? 

                AHMAD 
         Yes. 

                MARIE 
         How? 

                AHMAD 
         I dont know. Maybe she reads your 
         emails. ( s h o w i n g   a   b o t t l e )  
         Where do you keep this? 
          
Marie takes the bottle of dishwashing liquid from Ahmad to put it in a 
cupboard. Ahmads words have peaked her curiosity. 


                MARIE 
         Did something happen? 

                AHMAD 
         Shall we go for a walk? 

                MARIE 
         No, Im tired. Whats the matter, 
         Ahmad? 

 
Ahmad goes to the door to close it so that they may speak in private. Ahmad sits down. Marie sits down opposite him. Marie is staring at him, waiting for him to speak. 
 
INT. MARIES HOUSE  UPSTAIRS ROOM  DAY 
 
Lea is sitting next to Lucie on the edge of the bed. A brief silence between them. Lea looks at Lucies worried face. 
 

                LEA 
         You want to go live with Dad? 

 
Lucie thinks for a moment then shrugs.  
 

                LEA 
         If you go, Ill come with you. 

                LUCIE 
         You have to stay here with Mom. 


                LEA 
         I want to be with you. 

                LUCIE 
         Its not a good idea. 
          

                LEA 
         Dads wife is a bit weird. 

 
There is silence between them. Ahmad calls Lucie from downstairs. Worried, Lucie gets up and leaves the room. Lea is watching her.  
 
INT. MARIES HOUSE  HALLWAY  KITCHEN  BACKYARD  DAY 
 
In the hallway, before Lucie comes into the kitchen, Ahmad quietly gestures to Lucie no to be worried and that her mother only wants to speak with her. Lucie goes towards the kitchen. Marie is standing like a zombie in the backyard behind the kitchen and smoking a cigarette. Lucie slowly walks in and stands in a corner of the kitchen. She is looking at her mother. A heavy silence. Marie realizes Lucie is in the kitchen. She comes back inside. She is consumed by anger, her hands are shaking with rage. 
 

                MARIE 
         Is what Ahmad said true? 

 
Lucie nods. Marie suddenly loses control and lunges towards her. She has burst into tears, she takes Lucie by the arms and shakes her violently while crying and screaming at her. 
                 
                MARIE 
                 ( c r y i n g )  
         Why did you do that to me? What did I 
         ever do to you? 

 
Lucie shows no reaction. She too is crying. She does not defend herself against her mothers beating. It is clear that she is feeling sorry for Marie. Ahmad who has heard the commotion, rushes into the kitchen to separate Lucie from her mothers grip. Marie is too angry to let Lucie go. He manages to free Lucie and pulls Marie to a corner of the 
kitchen. Lea has also come down and is witnessing this fight. Marie suddenly starts punching her own stomach. Ahmad holds her hands to prevent her from doing this. 
 


                AHMAD 
         Stop it, Marie! Calm down! 

                MARIE 
         You little shit! 

                AHMAD 
         Marie! Easy... 

                MARIE 
         Get your hands off me! 

                AHMAD 
         You promised not to do that. 

                MARIE 
                 ( t o   L u c i e )  
         Get out of this house! Get out! 

 
Again Marie tries to lunge at Lucie. Ahmad struggles to stop her and sends Lucie out of the kitchen. 
 

                AHMAD 
                 ( t o   L u c i e )  
         Go. 

 
Marie aimlessly walks around the kitchen. Ahmad comes towards her to try and calm her down. 
 

                AHMAD 
         Shes in enough pain. I asked her to 
         tell you. She couldve stopped me from 
         talking to you. I couldve asked her 
         to keep the secret. Youd have 
         preferred not to know anything for the 
         rest of your life? 

 
Marie suddenly lashes out at Ahmad. 
 

                MARIE 
         Will you shut up! 


                AHMAD 
         Remember youre the one who wrote 
         those emails. She only forwarded them. 

                MARIE 
         I dont want to hear you. I hate it 
         when you lecture me! It disgusts me! 

                 
                AHMAD 
                 ( t o   L e a )  
         Go to your room sweetheart 

 
Ahmad walks towards Lea, sends her out of the kitchen and closes the door. 
 

                AHMAD 
         Im not lecturing you! You asked me to 
         come here and talk to Lucie! 

                MARIE 
               ( s c r e a m i n g   a n d  
                  c r y i n g )  
         Fuck off! I didnt ask you here for 
         Lucie! I asked you to come here after 
         four years just to sign that fucking 
         piece of paper and then get lost 
         forever! 
          

                AHMAD 
         Listen. Why didnt you ask me to come 
         last year? Why do I have to be here in 
         the middle of this shit... 
                 
                MARIE 
         Screw you. 

                AHMAD 
         ... without even knowing youre 
         getting married?  
          

                MARIE 
                  ( a n g r y )  
         Read your emails! 
          

                AHMAD 
         And you didnt book me a hotel. And 
         you made me sleep next to his son. 
         Why?  
          

                MARIE 
         I sent you an your email... 
          

                AHMAD 
         You made me come here just to get 
         revenge. Thats all its about. 

                MARIE 
             ( a n g r y   a n d   s a r c a s t i c )  
         Yes, youre right. Happy? 

                AHMAD 
         Just before seeing the judge, you tell 
         me youre pregnant. Why? 

                MARIE 
         Do,t you want to get out of here? 
         Just leave for good? Please... 

 
Lea runs into the kitchen. 
 

                LEA 
         Shes leaving! 

 
Ahmad is worried. He comes out of the kitchen with Lea. Angry and frustrated, Marie sits at the kitchen table. 
 
EXT. MARIES HOUSE  STREET  DAY  
 
Lucie, her eyes puffy and teary, walks quickly down the street. Ahmad runs after her. 
 

                AHMAD 
         Lucie! Lucie! 

 
Although she can hear him, Lucie does not respond to his calls. Ahmad reaches her and blocks her path. 
 

                AHMAD 
         Where are you going? 

Lucie does not respond and tries to go around him. Ahmad grips her hand. 
 

 

                AHMAD 
                 ( f i r m l y )  
         Come back! 

                LUCIE 
         Who are you to boss me around? 

 
Ahmad has nothing to say to her. 
 

                AHMAD 
         Lucie, your mother is not feeling well 
         right now. Plese, dont make it worse. 

                LUCIE 
         Why did you tell her? 

                AHMAD 
         You said I could. 

                LUCIE 
         You left me no choice. 

                AHMAD 
         I wanted to spare you suffering. 

                LUCIE 
         Am I not suffering now? Am I well? 

 
Ahmad does not respond. Lucie pulls her hand from his and leaves. Ahmad is upset. Lucie continues walking, then again she stops. 
 

                LUCIE 
         Can you lend me some money? 

                AHMAD 
         Wait, Ill come with you. 

 
Lucie waits at Ahmads insistence. Ahmad rushes back to the house and goes inside. 
 
INT. MARIES HOUSE  HALLWAY AND KITCHEN  DAY 
 
Ahmad is rushing down the stairs and putting on his coat. He comes towards the kitchen. Lea is standing in the kitchen doorway. Dazed, Marie, who has stopped crying, is sitting at the kitchen table. 

 

 

                MARIE 
         Wait Ill go. 

 
Marie comes out of the kitchen and walks towards the front door. Lea is looking at Ahmad who is standing there not knowing what to do. Ahmad comes towards her. Together they walk into the kitchen. Ahmad sits on the chair and Lea gently leans against him and stands there. 
                 
                LEA 
         What was in those emails? 

                AHMAD 
         I dont know 

 
EXT. MARIES HOUSE  STREET  DAY 
 
Marie has reached Lucie who is standing on the side of the road. She quickly looks at her in silence. 
 

                MARIE 
         Come back home. 

 
Lucie looks at her mother in silence. 
 

                MARIE 
         Lets get back in. 

73. INT. SHAHRYARS HOUSE  WORK ROOM  DAY 
 
Ahmad is sitting at a workbench. 

 

 

                SHAHRYAR 
                   ( i n   P e r s i a n )  
         Ahamd, look at me. Dont get sucked 
         back into this. Cut. Remember Mitra 
         and me? Cut. Life goes on without you 
         and me.  

                AHMAD 
                  ( i n   P e r s i a n )  
         I think to myself if I hadnt left 
         four years ago... 

                SHAHRYAR 
                   ( i n   P e r s i a n )  
         You wouldve left a year later if 
         not, two years later. I told you from 
         the beginning, you were not made for 
         this place. You have to choose. Its 
         either one way or the other. You cant 
         have it both ways. 

Ahmad has nothing to say to Shahryar. 
 
INT. MARIES HOUSE  KITCHEN  NIGHT 
 
Marie is holding her phone, full trepidation, she paces back and forth in the kitchen. She dials a couple of numbers, but she changes her mind and hangs up. Lucie quietly comes into the kitchen from the hallway. She is looking at the phone in her mothers hand. 

 

                LUCIE 
         Are you going to tell him? 

 
Marie just looks at Lucie. She has no answer. 
 

                LUCIE 
         You dont have to. 

 Marie thinks of what Lucie has said. She sits down at the kitchen table. 
 

                MARIE 
         Go to bed. And turn off the light, 
         please. 

 
Lucie turns off the light and leaves the kitchen. Marie places the phone on the table and stays there in the darkness. 

EXT. SIDEWALK OUTSIDE THE DRYCLEANERS  DAY 
 
Marie is walking down the sidewalk. Its a long walk to the 
drycleaners. From her eyes, it is clear that she has not had a good 
nights sleep. 
 
INT. DRYCLEANERS  DAY  CONTINUED 
 
Marie enters the drycleaners. Naima is busy getting the clean clothing out of the large washing machine. Fouad is busy drawing in a corner. Naima notices Marie who has now come to this side of the counter. 
 

                NAIMA 
         Hello, Maam. 

                MARIE 
         Hello. Is Samir here? 

                NAIMA 
         Hes upstairs. 

 
Marie goes towards the back door. 
 
INT. SAMIRS HOUSE  STAIRWAY  DAY  
 
Marie climbs the narrow stairway, which connects the dry cleaners to Samirs house on the second floor. She rings the doorbell. 
 
INT. SAMIRS HOUSE  DAY  
 
A small house located above the dry cleaners with windows facing the street. It is clear that life has not flowed in this house for some time and everything is a mess. From the vanity drawer, Samir takes out the half-full perfume bottles belonging to his wife. Marie is standing a bit further away. 
 

                MARIE 
         Whats all this? 

                SAMIR 
         Her perfumes. Im taking them to the 
         hospital. 


                MARIE 
         What for? 

                SAMIR 
          For a test. One of her nurses was 
         saying that the memory of smell is the 
         last one you lose. 

 
A silence ensues. Samir places the perfume bottles on the table. Marie is staring at the perfumes. She takes one of them and looks at it. 
 

 

                MARIE 
         That is your cologne... 

                SAMIR 
         She liked it. 

 
Samir has noticed something suspicious in Maries expression. 
 


                SAMIR 
         What? 

                MARIE 
         Nothing.  

                SAMIR 
         Why dont you sit? 

                MARIE 
         I have to go. 

 
Marie is not feeling like she usually does. He is waiting for her to speak. 

 

          

                MARIE 
         I dont like it when hide your 
         feelings. 

                SAMIR 
         Im not hiding anything. 

                MARIE 
         You mean you are not happy? 

                SAMIR 
         About what? 

                MARIE 
         Is it not good news that there is 
         still hope that she can react to 
         something? 

                SAMIR 
         What do you want me to say? 
                 
                MARIE 
         Youre stuck between your wife and me. 

                SAMIR 
         You ralized that overnight? 

                MARIE 
         Ive felt it for a long time. 

                SAMIR 
         Since when? 

                MARIE 
         What do you mean? 

                SAMIR 
         You didnt say things like that until 
         last week. 

 
The weight of Samirs comment sinks in. 
 

                MARIE 
         I always felt it but I wasnt brave 
         enough to tell you earlier. Maybe I 
         wasnt sure of what I felt. 

 

                SAMIR 
         What do you feel? 

                MARIE 
         That I am only here to fill the 
         void left by your wife.                           
          
Samir is hurt by Marie. A brief silence. 
                 
                SAMIR 
         Whose void am I supposed to fill in 
         your life? 
         

                MARIE 
                  (upset)    
         No ones. 
          

                SAMIR 
         Are you sure? 
           

                MARIE 
         Of what? 
          

                SAMIR 
         Im not here to make up for your 
         failed marriage ? 

                MARIE 
         If that was the case, I wouldnt be 
         carrying your child. 

                SAMIR 
         That was an accident. 
          

                MARIE 
         I couldve not kept it. 
          

                SAMIR 
         You kept it because you wanted to 
         erase that man, to convince yourself 
         that it was over, that youd turned 
         the page and you were starting 
         something new with someone else. But 
         the problem is that youre still not 
         convinced. Otherwise, you wouldnt 
         have brought him home, youd have let 
         him go to a hotel. 

 
Marie is staring at him. 
 
 

                SAMIR 
         Ever since hes come back, youve 
         changed. I dont even recognize you 
         anymore. 

                 
                MARIE 
         I feel this way because Ive found out 
         why your wife... 

                SAMIR 
         Leave her out oh this, please. 
          

                MARIE 
         She knew... 

                SAMIR 
         You sound like your crazy daughter. 

                SAMIR 
         If shed known, shed have said 
         something to me at some point. 

                MARIE 
         She never asked about me? 

                SAMIR 
         Ask what? 

                MARIE 
         I dont know. Why I came so often... 
                 
                SAMIR 
         For her, you were just a customer. 

                MARIE 
         What about you? Didnt she suspect 
         you? 

                SAMIR 
         No. I wish she had. At least, itd 
         have meant she cared enough to try and 
         find out if there was someone else. 

 
Marie is silent for a moment. Samir places the perfumes inside a box. Marie gets up to walk towards the door. 
                 
                MARIE 
         Lucie sent her our emails. 

 
Samir is shocked, staring at Marie. There is a heavy silence between 
them. 


                SAMIR 
         Howd she get her email? 

                MARIE 
         Your wife gave it to her. 

                SAMIR 
         But they never met... 

                MARIE                     
         Lucie called her at the shop and told 
         her she had emails we had sent each 
         other and that she wanted to forward 
         them. Your wife accepted. 

 
Samir stares at Marie in disbelief. Again, there is silence between them. 

                SAMIR 
         When did she call her? 

                MARIE 
         The day before her suicide. 

 
Samir drops his gaze and stares at the perfumes. Marie leaves his house. 
 
INT. DRY CLEANERS  DAY 
 
Samir enters the dry cleaners from the back door. He is preoccupied. Naima is writing up an order for a customer. He waits for the customer to leave. He is looking at Fouad who is still drawing in his notebook. As soon as the customer leaves, he calls Naima. 
 

                SAMIR 
         Naima come here a second. 

 
Naima walks towards Samir. 
 



                SAMIR 
         After the fight with Celine... you 
         know, when I asked her to go... did 
         she ever come by the shop when I was 
         out? 


                NAIMA 
         No. 

                SAMIR 
         What about when she wanted to go 
         upstairs?  Would she pass through 
         here? 

                NAIMA 
         I didnt see her the last few days. 

                SAMIR 
         She was always up there? 

                NAIMA 
         She only came down the day it 
         happened. 
          

                SAMIR 
         Not the day before? 

                NAIMA 
         No, why? 
                 
                SAMIR 
         Someone says that they called here and 
         talked to my wife. 
          
A costumer comes and Naima goes to her. 
 
EXT. STREET OPPOSITE PHARMACY  INT. PHARMACY  DAY  
 
Upset, Marie is filling the prescription for a customer. She spots Samir who is waiting for her outside the pharmacy. She quickly gets the prescription for the customer and sends her to the register to pay. She comes out of the pharmacy. Her co-worker who is ringing up the customer, is frustrated with Maries sloppy work. She glances outside and sees Marie and Samir talking. 

INT. MARIES HOUSE  DOWNSTAIRS BEDROOM  NIGHT 
 
A small lamp is on. Marie is lying on her bed by herself and she is staring out into space. The door gently opens. Lucie comes in. Marie realizes Lucie is there but shows no reaction. Lucie comes towards the bed. She pulls the blanket to the side and lies down next to her mother who has her back towards her. She pulls the blanket over herself. For a moment, they lie like this side by side. Lucie turns towards her 
mother. She holds her from behind. Marie takes her hand and presses it to her chest. 

                LUCIE 
         Im sorry, Mom. 

                MARIE 
         Promise not to lie to me again. 

                LUCIE 
         When did I lie to you? 

                MARIE 
         When you say youd forwarded the 
         emails. 

 
Lucie is shocked at hearing this but she does not respond. From her look, it is clear that she is debating whether to speak or to remain silent. 
 

                MARIE 
         You promise? 

 
Lucie remains silent. 
 

                MARIE 
         Okay? 

                LUCIE 
         Why do you think it was a lie? 

                MARIE 
         Because she wasnt at the shop the day 
         before her suicide. 

 
Again Lucie is silent. She lets go of her mother and turns onto her back. She stares at the ceiling. Marie is surprised at her reaction and turns her head towards her. She looks at Lucie. Lucie speaks in response to Maries inquisitive gaze. 
 

                LUCIE 
         I spoke to her. 

                MARIE 
         No. 
                LUCIE 
         Yes. She had an accent. 

                MARIE 
         His wife is French. 
 
Now they are both thinking the same thing. Marie is worried. 

EXT. SIDEWALK  MORNING 
 
Samir is waiting for Naima to arrive, it is clear that he is extremely 
upset and angry. A brief moment passes. Naima enters. 
 

                NAIMA 
         Morning. 
 
Naima goes to the back, takes off her jacket and hangs it up along with her purse. Samir stands opposite her and stares into her eyes. Naima is worried. 
 

                SAMIR 
         Why did you do it? 

                NAIMA 
         Do what? 

                SAMIR 
         Why did you pretend to be my wife and 
         gave her email? 

 
Naima is scared. She does not react. Samir is angry, still waiting for 
her to answer. 

                SAMIR 
         Well? 

                NAIMA 
         Sorry. 

Naima is silent. 
	
			SAMIR 
          Im not asking for an apology. Im 
         asking why! 

                NAIMA 
         She didnt like me. 


                SAMIR 
         What? 

                NAIMA 
         She hated me. 

                SAMIR 
         Had you done something? 

                NAIMA 
         No. 
 
               SAMIR 
         Then why did she hate you? 
                 
                NAIMA 
         She thought there was something going 
         on between us. 

                SAMIR 
         She thought that? Why would she? 

                SAMIR 
         Why would she think that? 

                NAIMA 
         Because you hired me even though I was 
         illegal she was suspicious. 

                SAMIR 
         Did she say anything to you? 

                NAIMA 
         No. 

                SAMIR 
         Where are you getting this crap then? 

                NAIMA 
         She was always after me, so I 
         thought... 

 
Fouad, just woken up, has opened the back door and come inside. 
 

 

                SAMIR 
         You thought?... Get out. She never 
         asked me to fire you. 

                NAIMA 
         But she kept doing things to get you 
         to fire me 

                SAMIR 
         Like what? 

                NAIMA 
         Lots of things. 

                SAMIR 
         What kind of things? 

                NAIMA 
         The day of the fight, the customer 
         called the police, she wouldnt let me 
         leave, she wanted me to stay.  
                 
                SAMIR 
         So what? 

                NAIMA 
         She wanted the police to find out 
         about me. 

                SAMIR 
         Thats it? Thats why shes in a 
         coma?... Get out. 

                NAIMA 
         That dress I took it out of the 
         machine. I took it, I ironed it, I 
         wrapped it up... there was no stain! 
         She made the stain, Im sure. Ive 
         been here for a year, Ive never seen 
         a stain like that.  

                SAMIR 
         How much do I owe you? 

 
Again Naima does not respond. Samir comes to the counter. He takes out some money from his pocket. He puts several bills on the counter and goes out to the sidewalk. Fouad is staring at Naima who is upset and walks towards her jacket and purse. 
 
EXT. DRYCLEANERS  SIDEWALK  DAY 
  
Samir is on the sidewalk. He is clearly upset. Carrying her purse on 
her shoulder, Naima comes out of the drycleaners. For a moment she 
pauses, then goes back towards the Samir. 
 

                NAIMA 
         I wanted her to know there was nothing 
         between us. You were always upset, 
         thinking about someone else , she 
         thought it was me. The day of the 
         fight, you asked me to stay, you took 
         my hand and you asked her to leave. I 
         saw her eyes for a second, I knew what 
         she was thinking. 

 

                SAMIR 
                  ( angry )  
         Because of what you did, this kids 
         mother has been a vegetable in a 
         hospital bed for the past eight 
         months.  

                NAIMA 
         Its not because of what I did. 
          

                SAMIR 
         You gave her email to that brat. 

                NAIMA 
         If she had read the emails, she would 
         have understood everything. Whyd she 
         have come and drunk the detergent in 
         front of me? Shed have gone to the 
         pharmacy and killed herself in front 
         of her. Or upstairs, in front of you. 
         Why in front of me? 

 
Samir has no response. Sad, Naima walks off and grows small in the 
distance. Samir is even more frustrated than before. 
          
INT. DRY CLEANERS  DAY 
 
Samir reenters the shop. He closes the front door. He moves to the back 
of the shop and walks through the racks of clothing. From among the 
clothes, he finds the dress Naima was talking about. He brings it down. 
He takes its cover off. He searches for the stain, looks at it 
carefully and smells it. 
 
INT. SAMIRS HOUSE  BATHROOM  DAY 
 
Samir and Fouad are in the bathroom. Fouad is sitting on the edge of 
the bathtub and Samir is clipping his fingernails. 
          

 

                FOUAD 
         Shes not coming back? 
 

                SAMIR 
         Who? 

                FOUAD 
         Naima. 

                SAMIR 
         No. 

                FOUAD 
         Why?
      
	          SAMIR 
         She did something wrong. 
                 
                FOUAD 
         But she said sorry. 

                SAMIR 
         Some things are unforgivable. 


                FOUAD 
         Like what? 
 

Samir doesnt know how to explain whats happening to Fouad. He just looks at him. He holds up his other hand and continues to clip his nails. He sees the band-aid on his finger. 
 

                SAMIR 
         What happened to your finger? 


                FOUAD 
         Nothing. 
 
Samir takes off the band-aid.  
 


                FOUAD 
         I want to go back to Leas. 

                SAMIR 
         We cant go for now. 

                FOUAD 
         When then? 

                SAMIR 
         Not as long as we dont know about 
         Mommy. 

                FOUAD 
         When will we know? 

                SAMIR 
                (frustrated)  
         I dont know. 

                FOUAD 
         I get bored here by myself. 

                SAMIR 
         Why dont you come down to see me? 

                FOUAD 
         I dont like it downstairs.  
          
Samir looks down and continues clipping his nails. It is clear that he 
is trying to hide the tears he feels after what Fouad has said.  
 
INT. PHARMACY  EXT. SIDEWALK  DAY 
 
Samir walks along the sidewalk. He reaches the pharmacy. Without 
stopping, he sneaks a peak inside the pharmacy. Marie is busy filling the prescription for an old male customer. Samir passes the pharmacy, and turns onto the next street. He stops a few yards away. He paces back and forth for a bit. He is hesitant. He goes back the same way he came, this time without looking inside the pharmacy. He goes back towards the drycleaners. He ears Maries voice from behind him. 
                 
                MARIE 
         Samir! 


 He stops and sees Marie who has come out of the pharmacy and is 
standing on the sidewalk. 
 
INT. DRY CLEANERS  EXT. SIDEWALK  DAY 
 
Fouad is busy drawing in a corner of the drycleaners. The glass door of the store is locked. Samir and Marie are on the sidewalk and have reached the door. Samir unlocks the door and they both come inside. He again locks the door from the inside. Fouad comes out form between the clothing racks. 
 




                FOUAD 
         Hello. 

                MARIE 
         Hello. 
 
Marie goes towards him. She kisses him. 
 

 

                SAMIR 
                 (to   Fouad )  
         Go upstairs, Fouad. 

                FOUAD 
         And then Ill go with Marie? 

                SAMIR 
         Go get your things. Make a drawing for 
         Mommy, ok? 

 
Samir accompanies Fouad to the back door. Fouad leaves. Marie sits on a chair by the counter.  

 

 

 

 

                 
                MARIE 
         Do you think she got our emails? 

                SAMIR 
         I dont know. 

                MARIE 
         If shed read them, she wouldve at 
         least said something to you. 

                SAMIR 
         Since the fight with the customer, 
         wed stopped speaking. It lasted until 
         the end. 

                MARIE 
         Even if shed read them, yesterday you 
         said she wouldnt have cared. 

 
Samir is silent. 

 
                 
                MARIE 
         Would she have cared? 

                SAMIR 
         Maybe.I dont know. Id rather talk 
         about now. That was then. Its over. 
         What I know now is that youre 
         carrying our child. We just have to 
         forget. 



                MARIE 
         Is that possible? 

                SAMIR 
         It should be. 

                MARIE 
         What if it isnt? 

Marie is deep in thought. 
 
INT. MARIES HOUSE  KITCHEN  EXT. BACK YARD  DAY  
 
Ahmad is standing in a corner and watching Marie who is filling the kettle in the sink. 
 

 

 

 

 

                AHMAD 
         Is your wrist better? 

                MARIE 
         It still hurts a bit. 

                AHMAD 
         You went to see a doctor? 

                MARIE 
         Its normal. Its the lack of calcium. 
         The babys taking it all. 

                AHMAD 
         How far along are you? 

                MARIE 
         A bit more than two months. 

                AHMAD 
         I thought youd hurt yourself 
         painting. 

                MARIE 
         I dont know, maybe. 

 
Theres a brief silence between them. Marie places the kettle on the stove and turns it on. 

 

 

                 
                AHMAD 
         Theres something I want to tell you 
         before I go. 

                MARIE 
         About what? 

                AHMAD 
         About when I left four years ago  


 
 

 

                MARIE 
         Its pointless now. 

                AHMAD 
         I want to explain why I didnt... 

                MARIE 
         No I dont want to look back anymore. 
         Forget it. 

 
Again theres silence. 
 

 

 

                AHMAD 
         Im off, then. 

                MARIE 
         And your things in the shed? 
          

                AHMAD 
         I dont want them. 



                MARIE 
         Take them. 
 
Ahmad notices Maries state. From the kitchen door, he enters the backyard to gather his belongings in the shed. 
 
EXT. MARIES HOUSE  YARD  DAY  
 
Ahmad comes to the yard holding a dusty suitcase. Lea and Fouad are 
busy playing with Leas helicopter. Ahmad goes towards Lea and hugs 
her. Fouad is watching them. Lea smiles. Ahmad looks at Fouad and also 
hugs him. 
 
INT. MARIES HOUSE  UPSTAIRS ROOM  EXT. YARD  DAY  
 
Lucie looks out at the yard from the window of her room. She watches Ahmad say goodbye to Lea and Fouad and walk toward the front gate. The children see him off. Ahmad goes onto the street. To better see him leave, Lucie places one foot on the bed and raises herself a little. Ahmad fades into the distance. Lucie stays there till Ahmad disappears from view. Once he is gone, she comes down from the bed. 
 
INT. HOSPITAL  HALLWAY  DAY 
 
Samir is in the hallway outside the door to his wifes room and he is looking inside the room. 
 
INT. HOSPITAL  HALLWAY AND PATIENTS ROOM  DAY 
 
From Samirs point of view, a doctor and nurse can be seen in the room in which Samirs wife is in a coma. They are performing tests and examining her.  

INT. HOSPITAL  HALLWAY  DAY 
 
Curious, Samir has approached the door. The doctor comes out of the 
room. Samirs inquisitive eyes are directed at him. The specialist 
takes Samir aside. 

 

 

                DOCTOR 
         Unfortunately she had no reaction.  



                SAMIR 
         None? 

                DOCTOR 
         None that I registered. 

                SAMIR 
         You mean the scratches on her stomach, 
         were involuntary? 

                DOCTOR 
         Possibly. As I told you, these tests 
         dont reflect her state of 
         consciousness. 

                SAMIR 
         But shed never scratched herself 
         before. 

                DOCTOR 
         I really cant say. The nurses may 
         have done it when moving her in her 
         bed. Theses patients have fragile 
         skin. 

                SAMIR 
         Doctor... how can I be sure its not 
         her? 

                DOCTOR 
         By doing further tests. But even if 
         the other tests results are negative, 
         therell still be room for doubt. In 
         these cases, you can never be sure. 

 
The doctor leaves. From the doorway, Samir is looking inside the room. 
The nurse who is busy collecting the perfumes, comes out of the room 
and walks towards Samir. 
 

                NURSE 
         I put the perfumes by her bed. 

                SAMIR 
         Did you test all of them? 

                NURSE 
         No just a couple of them. 

 
The nurse leaves. Samir enters the room. 
 
INT. HOSPITAL  PATIENTS ROOM  DAY 
 
Samir comes into the room. His ill wife is lying motionless on the bed. 
On the walls are drawings which were drawn by Fouad. Samir takes the 
box of perfumes to reluctently leave the room. As he exits, he 
hesitates and goes back to his wifes side. He sits by her on the bed and stares at her. He takes the mens cologne, the scent which he knows his wife liked, and pours some of it onto the palm of his hand. He holds his hand gently in front of his wifes nose. He lowers his head towards her ear and whispers something to her. He stares at her hand and feet to see a reaction. He keeps holding his hand up to her face. He places his finger in Celines motionless hand. 
 

                SAMIR 
         If you can smell the perfume, squeeze 
         my hand, Celine. 

 
He keeps watching his finger and Celines hand. The end titles appear 
and fade on this shot.
