EXT. DEEP IN THE WOODS (LIVE ACTION) - DAY
PUSH IN SLOWLY through thick ferns, mossy trees.  Peaceful, 
but like the calm before the storm.  Like a scene from 
Jurassic Park.  Suddenly, a LOW RUMBLE... the sound of FEET 
rushing.  Little feet.  Lots of them.  

A FLASH OF BLUE in the underbrush.  And another.  Then... An 
explosion of blue and white as a throng of blue GNOME-LIKE 
creatures (SMURFS) explode into view, frantically fleeing with 
gazelle-like precision or like a school of land-going fish.  
(NOTE: Smurfs will be CGI in a live-action world, throughout).

As they whip past camera, a beast explodes from the bushes, 
leaping directly toward the SCREEN, claws and fangs bared.   
Its a huge mangy HOUSE CAT -- terrifying from a Smurfs POV.

At the head of the Smurfs is a sweet, dopey, but terrified 
looking fellow.  This is CLUMSY.  We rocket into a CU of his 
face and... FREEZE FRAME.

EXT. DEEP IN THE WOODS - SMURF VILLAGE - ESTABLISHING SHOT

Mushroom cottages abound beneath a banner that reads: Festival 
of the Blue Moon, for which SMURFS cook, build and decorate.  
Several FLY into the tiny UTOPIA on a tame STORK.  

ANGLE ON Vanity and SMURFETTE, leading a group of SMURFS in a 
comical dance rehearsal to the beat of native DRUMS.

             VANITY
      Five, six, seven, eight!

             SMURFETTE
      Thats it, Clumsy, feel the rhythm.  
      Good job, Hefty.  Almost lunch time, 
      Greedy, hang in there.

Brainy supervises decorations nearby, but cant resist 
interjecting. 

             BRAINY
      No, no, no!  You call that dancing?!  

             VANITY
      I told you it was too complicated.


THE SMURFS - Stem & Weiss - 6/16/09 
                                             2.

             BRAINY
      Im sorry.  What part of step-ball-
      change, pas de beurre, jazz hands is 
      so hard to understand?!

The stare at him, blankly.

             HEFTY
      The whole thing.

             CLUMSY
      We could do the hokey pokey.

             BRAINY
      Look whos talking, its the dancing 
      bear!

Brainy does an comic impression of Clumsys dancing.

             VANITY
      Hes doing the best he can... with 
      what little he has.

             CLUMSY
      Thank you.  I think.

             BRAINY
        (to Greedy)
      And you!  Every time you turn its 
      like watching jelly jiggle.  And 
      dont get me started on this guy!

He turns to Gutsy, a tough-looking Smurf in a kilt who stares 
him down.

             GUTSY
        (in thick Scottish brogue)
      Watch wat ya say lad, or youll be 
      wearing yer lips like a scarf!

             BRAINY
      Because hes doing fine.

             LAZY
      All this dancings making me tired.

Lazy YAWNS and falls face-first into the dirt, asleep.   

             BRAINY
      People, please!  Tonights the Blue 
      Moon!  A magical time where wishes 
      are granted, the smurfberry crop is 
      blessed, and anything is possible.

                                             3.

             BRAINY (CONT'D)
      Anything, except getting you people 
      to dance right.  Now, from the top!

On Brainys CUE, the SMURF ORCHESTRA launches into SONG #1 -- 
a celebration of the powers of the Blue Moon.  CRAZY, who can 
make virtually any noise with his mouth, takes vocals as the 
others break out in an insane Busby-Berkely dance number.

             SMURFETTE AND SMURFS (SINGING)
      La la la-la-la-la la la la la la...

With Smurfette front and center, the otherwise all-male dance 
troupe cant keep their eyes off of her.  Many are injured.

In the end, Clumsy trips, setting off a chain reaction of 
falling Smurfs, and knocking a ladder and paint onto Brainy.  

END SONG/DANCE SEQUENCE.

INT. PAPA SMURFS MUSHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

PAPA, the oldest and wisest of Smurfs (set apart by his beard 
and RED pants & hat) HUMS as he works on a potion.  A great 
sorcerer, Papas LAB is packed with alchemy books and gear.

             PAPA
        (squinting, tired)
      ...Six milkworm hairs and precisely 
      one drop of starweed nectar. 

             CLUMSY (O.S.)
      Papa Smurf!  Papa Smurf!

Papa pours one drop... then, WHAM!  The door flies open and 
Clumsy rushes in.  Startled, Papa drops in the whole bottle 
and the potion explodes.

             PAPA
        (swallowing his temper)
      Yeeees, Clumsy?  What is it?

             CLUMSY
      Brainy sent me to see if you need any 
      help getting ready for the festival.

             PAPA
      He sent you here?  I thought you were 
      dancing.

             CLUMSY
      He said my dancing was so good, I 
      should take a break so he doesnt 
      pull his hair out in happiness!


THE SMURFS - Stem & Weiss - 6/16/09 
                                             4.

Smurfette appears in the doorway.

             PAPA
      Let me guess, another helper?

             SMURFETTE
      Or else Brainy said I have to dance 
      in a burka.  What is a burka?

             PAPA
      Very well, why dont you two go pick 
      Smurfberries while I gather more 
      starweed, for our wishing potion.

             SMURFETTE
      Papa, we have barrels of berries.

             CLUMSY
      Can I get the starweed, Papa?  
      Please!  Its my fault you ran out. 

             SMURFETTE
      I could go with him.

             PAPA
      No, no.  The starweed grows too close 
      to Gargamels castle.  Its far too 
      dangerous for young Smurfs. 

             CLUMSY
      But Im brave!  If danger comes, Ill 
      just freeze, like you taught us. 

Striking an absurd blending in pose, Clumsy hits a pile of 
ancient books, which buries him.  He leaps back up.

             CLUMSY (CONTD)

      Im o-kay

             PAPA
      Smurfnabit, Clumsy... 
        (catching himself)
      I mean... Ill just get the starweed 
      myself this time.   Why dont you too 
      run along and help set the table?

             CLUMSY
      Oh.  Sure, Papa Smurf... Sorry.

Clumsy sadly exits.  Papa begins cleaning.  Smurfette watches 
him, concerned.


THE SMURFS - Stem & Weiss - 6/16/09 
                                             5.

             PAPA
      What?  Dont smurf around the bush, 
      Smurfette.  You have that... look.

             SMURFETTE
      When are you going to realize were 
      not Smurflings anymore, Papa?  The 
      boys are one-hundred and four.

             PAPA
      Mere toddlers, my dear.  A Papas 
      work is never done.  

             SMURFETTE
      Well, it might be, if you let us help 
      you a little more.  I worry about you 
      -- always working so hard.

             PAPA
        (fixing her hair)
      Ahhh, my sweet little Smurfette.

             SMURFETTE
      I mean it, Papa.  Youve raised us 
      really well.  Its time you trust us 
      with more responsibility and take 
      better care of yourself for a change. 

From O.S. comes the CACOPHONY of the rehearsal chaos.

             PAPA
      You were saying?  Come, lets quiet 
      them down before the whole world 
      knows were here...

As Smurfette rolls her eyes and follows him out.

      Aye, Sir Tony.  A terrible weight.

INT. YE OLDE CONVENTION CENTER - CONTINUOUS

CLOSE ON: TONY ROBBINS-HOOD, pacing energetically onstage.

             TONY ROBBINS-HOOD
      And thy steps, are they not laden 
      with heaviness?

ANGLE TO REVEAL SIR GALAHAD, with Tony, in heavy black ARMOR.

             SIR GALAHAD (MANS VOICE)
      Aye, terrible heaviness.

             TONY ROBBINS-HOOD
      Then, friend, unshackle thine power 
      and reach! Reach for thy potential!

Tony bounces exuberantly.  Galahad struggles to bounce, but 
falls offstage into a sea of bouncing WIZARDS and KNIGHTS.

             TONY ROBBINS-HOOD (CONTD)
      And how better, than with my new 
      book, Steal From the Rich and Stop 
      Being Poor!  

Pulling an arrow from his quiver, Tony points and flips 
through wooden, Bosch-like ILLUSTRATIONS of his techniques.

             TONY ROBBINS-HOOD (CONTD)
      In Chapter One, youll follow a 
      leprechaun to rainbows end, throttle 
      him, and take his gold!  In Chapter 
      Two, well sneak into a dragons 
      lair, slay him and take his gold.  
      Ever spot a Unicorn?  Chapter Three 
      teaches thee to track him down, roast 
      him for supper and take his gold!

             HOODED FIGURE
      Excuse me!  What about... Smurfs?

A HUSH as all heads turn to see a HOODED FIGURE, in a frayed 
brown monks robe, raise a craggy hand.  This is GARGAMEL.

             TONY ROBBINS-HOOD
      Smurfs?  The mythical blue folk in 
      tiny white pants and hats?  About 
      three apples high?

             GARGAMEL (HOODED FIGURE)
      Aye, the very same.  Treacherous 
      creatures whose very essence can be 
      the source of infinite power!

                                             7.

             TONY ROBBINS-HOOD
      Sir, I offer science, not 
      superstitious knavery!
        (to crowd)
      Likely he imagines the world to be a 
      large round globe!

HOWLS of LAUGHTER.  A WIZARD LAUGHS so hard, LIGHTNING from 
his wand, turns a HUNCHBACK into a NEWT.  It eyes Gargamel.  

             NEWT (COCKNEY ACCENT)
      I remember you!  Flunked out of  
      Sorcerers Tech.  Obsessed with 
      Smurfs.  Had this huge stupid cat.

             GARGAMEL
      Dont be absurd.

MEOOOW.  AZRAEL, the huge scraggly CAT, whom we recognize from 
the opening, rubs against Gargamels leg.

             GARGAMEL (CONTD)
      Not now, Azrael.

The crowd LAUGHS again.

             TONY ROBBINS-HOOD
      Wait!  I believe I do have bit of 
      trivia on these, valuable Smurfs...

Tony produces part of a tattered BLUE SCROLL.  Gargamel GASPS.

             TONY ROBBINS-HOOD (CONTD)
      Won it in Parchesi from a peg-legged 
      crusader.  Bark like a dog and its 
      all yours!  Come now, you 
      superstitious peasant.  Awwwwooooo!

More LAUGHTER.  Furious, Gargamel throws back his hood to 
reveal the face of a brilliant, but hapless madman.

             GARGAMEL (HOODED FIGURE)
      Youll rue the day you laughed at the 
      great, and soon to be exceedingly 
      powerful... Gargamel.  

Hurling a vial to the floor, POOF!  Gargamel vanishes in a 
PLUME of smoke.  The crowed OOOOOs in awe.  Suddenly, the 
scroll is YANKED from Tonys hand and begins beating him.

             GARGAMEL (O.S.) (CONTD)
      Whos laughing now?  Who?  Or is it 
      whom?  Either way, it is I, I!  


THE SMURFS - Stem & Weiss - 6/16/09 
                                             8.

But as he gloats, he doesnt notice his invisibility wear 
off... until Tony decks him into the crowd.  KNIGHTS fall like 
dominos.  Lanterns fly.  Flames erupt.  Everyone flees.

EXT. MEDIEVAL TOWN - FAIRE - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

People rush from the fire. Gargamel staggers out with Azrael.

             GARGAMEL
      Cursed invisibility spell!  Making a 
      mockery of me!  But with this, we 
      shall never be mocked again.
        (reveals scroll segment)
      Feast your eyes, Azrael!  Feast!

They stare absurdly at the scroll segment for a beat, 
feasting.  Clearly, it bears greater import than Tony knew.  

             GARGAMEL (CONTD)
      This will lead us to the Smurfs.  And 
      when we extract the essence of those 
      wretched beasts, pure, unfailing, 
      unimaginable power will be ours.  And 
      these fools will worship us like gods.

A FAIRE GOER, among MANY taking lessons at BILL TELLS 
ARCHERY BOOTH, turns to mock Gargamel...

      VISITOR
Worshipped?  You??  What a 
crock of bull--

CROWD
(re arrow)
Bullseye!

Whoosh.  To his STUDENTS delight, MR. TELLs arrow skewers 
all three apples, mid-air, and continues toward...

EXT. DEEP WOODS - DAY - CONTINUOUS 

A tiny BLUE HAND reaches from within the undergrowth and picks 
a starweed flower.  TILTDOWN down to reveal Clumsy, filling a 
sack with the flowers for Papa. berry... then another.  
Nearby, a few more BLUE HANDS suddenly pick a branch clean.

             CLUMSY
      Were too young to pick starweed?  
      Ha.  Its too dangerous?  Pleeease.

THWACK!  William Tells apple-laden arrow lands like a totem 
pole beside Clumsy, terrifying him and revealing him to be 
precisely three apples high.  He FREEZES in his absurd pose.

EST. GARGAMELS CASTLE - DAY

An ominous hovel of stone, spewing dark SMOKE from a chimney.

INT.  GARGAMELS CASTLE - DAY

The would-be wizard HUMS while methodically smoothing his new 
blue scroll segment on the table of his ramshackle lab.  He 
then produces an horrifying implement of torture and... 
smashes his piggy bank with it.  Azrael is aghast.  From the 
shards he pulls... the other half of blue scroll.  He breaks 
into a fit of egomaniacal laughter.  Azrael joins him.

             GARGAMEL
        (stops abruptly)
      Now youre just milking it.

Gargamel smooths the pieces together and the pages MAGICALLY 
BOND, shimmering to life.  

             GARGAMEL (CONTD)
      Behold, my friend...The window of 
      Smurf.

ANGLE ON the completed scroll: like a living window: Clumsy is 
revealed in the woods below the castle.

                                 SMASH TO:

EXT. DEEP IN THE WOODS - DAY

Flees through the woods at top speed.

             CLUMSY
      Hes coming!  Hes coming!

Up ahead, a troop of other SMURFS stop picking smurfberries 
and look up to see Clumsy with Azrael is not far behind.  
Clumsy charges through the group and they instantanly follow.

FREEZE FRAME: On Clumsys terrified face.

SUPER: THIS IS WHERE YOU CAME IN.

The action resumes as the Gazelle-like pack rushes through the 
woods.  Coming upon JOKEY and other Smurfs, working on SMURF 
DAM.  They charge across.

             CLUMSY (CONTD)

      Azrael!

Sure enough, not far behind Azrael, Gargamel comes into view, 
reading his magic scroll.  In the panic, Clumsy and the others 
leap off SMURF DAM, onto log rafts, SHOOTING THE RAPIDS full 
speed.

EXT. SMURF VILLAGE - LATE AFTERNOON

Papa dutifully enjoys as Brainy conducts HARMONY, Crazy and 
the SMURF ORCHESTRA to a comically bumpy finale.

                                MEANWHILE:

             PAPA
      And then after the music, I will 
      smurf the wishing potion into the 
      well and well all hold our wishes 
      deep in our hearts.  Now, remember, 
      only the Smurf with the purest, most 
      gentle heart will have his wish 
      granted.  

             CLUMSY (O.S.)
      Aaaaaaaaagh!

Clumsy and the others roar into the village on the rafts, 
leaping and falling to shore.

             CLUMSY (CONTD)
      Papa Smurf!  Papa Smurf!

             PAPA
      Not now, Clumsy.  
        (to the others)
      Then well all gaze up at the rising 
      of the glorious Blue Moon and say... 
      AHHHH!

The Smurfs look up as Gargamels huge head looms into view.

             GARGAMEL
        (starting the famous song)
      BLuuUE MOoooN.  YOU SAW ME STANDING 
      ALONE--
        (re Azraels PROTEST)
      Alright, so I brought my cat.

Crazy begins making an ALARM SOUND as Smurfs SCREAM and 
scatter.  Azrael charges.  Gargamel is right behind.   

Papa sprints past Clumsy.

             CLUMSY
      Papa Smurf!  Gargamels coming.

      I noticed!  Run!

             GARGAMEL
      Oh, you can run... But Ill tan your 
      hide!

Papa and Clumsy dash for a mushroom cottage.  But Gargamel 
obliterates it with his foot.  The force of the STOMP sends 
Papa and Clumsy FLYING in opposite directions.  

In the melee, Papa smashes open what looks like a glass case 
where a fire hose would be.  But instead of a hose, it 
contains a leather pouch with an emergency stash of 
smurfberrires.

             PAPA
        (to pouch)
      Old friend, I hoped it would never 
      come to this.

EXT. NEARBY WOODS - SUNDOWN - MOMENTS LATER

Like thundering buffalo, the Smurfs roar for a narrow ravine.

             PAPA
      Smurfentine!  Smurfentine!

Darting as a persicion herd, the Smurfs dodge Azareal and 
enter the ravine, passing a sign: FORBIDDEN GROTTOS-KEEP OUT!

             SMURFETTE
      Forbidden Grottos?!  The last Smurf 
      to go in here was never seen again!

             BRAINY
        (hurrying past her)
      Then dont be last!

They pass more signs: Agony Ahead!... Perhaps Death!... Then, 
More Agony!... I Mean It!... Especially in a Blue Moon!  

EXT. FORBIDDEN GROTTOS - TWILIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

The Smurfs stumble into a lush, green, dead end.  Walled by 
steep rock, a baby stream flows from a pond at the base of a 
smurf-sized WATERFALL. 

             SMURFETTE
      Its a dead end!  Theres nowhere to 
      hide!

             CLUMSY
        (forgetting their danger)
      Hey, look!  The Blue Moon!

Peeking through trees, a huge BLUE MOON edges over the ravine.  
As its rays hit the pond, Clumsy doesnt see the little falls 
begin to magically SHIMMER behind him.   

             PAPA
      Clumsy, no!  

He reaches for Clumsys wrist just as THHHHHP!  Clumsy flails 
backwards, sucked INTO THE MAGICAL FALLS, enveloped in a 
RAINBOW of ENERGY.  He disappears through the once solid rock 
wall behind the falls.  Papas pulled in too.  Followed by one 
Smurf after another as they grab to save one another.  

Gargamel bursts onto the scene only to find... theyre gone.

             GARGAMEL
      Cowards!  Come out and fight like 
      men!  Albeit, very small, decidedly 
      blue men, but still--

Suddenly his face LIGHTS UP... as he sees the SHIMMERING falls 
enveloped in a RAINBOW of ENERGY.

                                WHITE OUT:

EXT. OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE WATERFALL/PORTAL - DAY

CLOSE ON another falls in a similar grotto.  The walls behind 
the falls CRACKLE with ELECTRICITY, then, Whoosh.  Out comes 
Papa, followed by a chain of SCREAMING Smurfs.  They land in a 
churning pool, just beneath the falls.

UNDERWATER: Smurfs frantically swim to the surface.  

As Hefty pulls comrades ashore -- Whoosh -- another CRACKLE of 
ENERGY and Gargamels hand reaches from the falls.

             PAPA

      Look out!

Gargamels arm flails in search of Smurfs.  Jokey pulls his 
floating GIFT BOX from the pool. 

             JOKEY
      Here you go.  Have a present!

He shoves the box into Gargamels huge hand, which promptly 
disappears back through the falls.

             JOKEY (CONTD)
      Wait for it...

WARBLEY DISTANT SOUND FX: KABOOM!  Followed by an ANGRY YOWL.  
But before the Smurfs can fully ENJOY Jokeys work...

             HEFTY
        (looking O.S., awed)
      Sweet mother of Smurf.

The Smurfs follow Romeos gaze to...

SMURFSS POV: Just downstream, another faire is in progress.  
But unlike the quaint, medieval affair of the opening, this is 
a FULLY MODERN TRADE SHOW of TODAY, with trucks, advertising, 
generators, rides and ROCK & ROLL.

             PAPA
      Wherever we are, weve got to gather 
      the others and find Clumsy before the 
      Blue Moon ends or well never get 
      home.  Cmon!

Papa and others race after the smurfs being swept downstream.

EXT. PARC DE WOLUWE - BRUSSELS - PRESENT DAY - CONTINUOUS

In classic European style, woods and lawns flourish near City 
Centre.  TOURISTS stroll the booths of a TRADE SHOW.  VENDORS 
show everything from hybrid cars to hi-tech health gear.  

BOOM DOWN from a Intl Retailers Faire Banner, to find Clumsy, 
wet and afaid, under a bench, staring up at a black monolith. 

CLUMSYS POV: Tilt up to reveal a statue of a Smurf.  The 
plaque reads: Le Grand Schtroumpf par Peyo.

Hearing LAUGHTER he turns to a large, colorful MUSHROOM that 
looms ahead, looking somewhat like a Smurf Cottage.  We 
recognize it as a MOONBOUNCE.  

             CLUMSY

      Papa?  

As Clumsy approaches, WHOOSH!  Hes SUCKED AGAINST the 
moonbounce intake grill.  The blower begins to WHEEZE.

CHILDREN SCREAM as the moonbounce begins to deflate around 
them.  PARENTS come running.  A CORD is KICKED.  The blower 
CUTS OFF.  Clumsy flops to the ground.  People see him...

             KIDS & PARENTS
      Agh, rongeur!  Sacre Bleu!... Blue?

                                             14.

Sticks and cans land all around a terrified Clumsy as he 
struggles to catch his breath and scramble away.  

He quickly darts under the flap of a NEARBY TENT.

EXT.  FORBIDDEN GROTTOS - NIGHT

Gargamel stumbles about in the pond, hoisting a log like a 
BATTERING RAM.  His clothes are a bit more tattered and his 
face is blackened by Jokeys recent explosion.

             GARGAMEL
      Hold on to your catnips, Azrael...

And with that, he charges the tiny falls with the log.

INT. SOUVENIR TENT - AFTERNOON

Looking to hide, Clumsy scrambles past the shoes of PATRICK 
WINSLOW (30s), a handsome, harried, American marketer for a 
cosmetics powerhouse.  As Patrick takes notes on a rivals 
products, his phone RINGS.

                            INTERCUT WITH... 

EXT. GRASSY CURBSIDE PARKWAY - MANHATTAN - AM SAME

Patricks daughter, SOPHIE (8), is on her mothers cell phone, 
pacing blithely with the familys trusty BEAGLE, TARZAN, who 
wears a protective lamp-shade collar.

             SOPHIE
      Hi, Daddy!  I miss you so much!  Do 
      you miss me?

             PATRICK
      Of course, princess.  Like crazy.

             SOPHIE
      Mom said, youre worried about money 
      so you might not bring us any 
      presents.  Is that for real?

             PATRICK
        (cant bear to hurt her)
      No, baby.  In fact, I already picked 
      you out something special...

Patrick glances about for a way to make this true.  Among the 
toys, he glimpses a small blue figure, FROZEN in a familiar 
blending-in pose.  As he crosses to it, a BELL BLARES from the 
SCHOOL behind Sophie.  Tarzan YOWLS.

             SOPHIE
      Its okay, Tarzan!  Tarzan, shhhh!

             PATRICK
      Where are you, Sophie?

Patrick picks up Clumsy, and inspects him.

             SOPHIE (O.S.)
      At Sammys school.

             PATRICK
      With Tarzan?

             SOPHIE
        (nonchalant)
      Yeah, Sammy got in trouble for flying 
      his helicopter at the pep rally so 
      mom had to pick him, and we were at 
      the vet cause, Tarzans teeth hurt.

             PATRICK

        (beat)

      Oh.

Just then, Patricks beautiful, frazzled wife (GRACIE), exits 
the school, trying to quiet a teething baby (REINA).  Son, SAM 
(14) is right behind, carrying a broken remote control 
helicopter.

             SOPHIE
      Mom, Daddy wants to talk to you!

             SAM
        (putting in earphones)
      It wasnt my fault!

             GRACIE (INTO PHONE)
      Hey, baby, how are you holding up?

             PATRICK
      Me?  How are you doing?  Whats going 
      on with Sam?

             GRACIE
      Hes alright.  But were gonna have 
      to pay for a new scoreboard... And 
      Coach Grubys tupee.  
        (for Sam)
      The Principal will tell us all about 
      it, in our meeting tomorrow night...

Sam rolls his eyes, then gets distracted by a cute girl going 
inside.  Gracie pulls him back to reality and toward the car.

      Ooookay.  And the dog?  Whats that 
      gonna to set us back?

             GRACIE
        (re dogs cone, wincing)
      Seven-hundred and fifty dollars?

Patricks heart skips a beat as he sets his impromptu gift 
selections at the register.  Gracie reluctantly continues...

             GRACIE (CONTD)
      Oh, and dont write any checks for a 
      little bit... I had to put down 
      $1,500 on Sophies braces. 

Sophie flashes a bracey smile.  Patrick sheepishly removes 
some gifts from the counter. The PROPRIETOR is not impressed.

             GRACIE (CONTD)
      Did you talk to Odile about 
      travelling less?

Patrick watches the proprietor scan Clumsy, whose eyes go 
cross-eyed as the laser hits him again and again.

             PATRICK
      Not yet, but I will.

             GRACIE
      Serious, honey.  This family needs 
      you. The kids miss you. I miss you.  

             PATRICK
      Ill talk to her.  I promise. 

As Gracie wrestles Reina into the car, the phone slips from 
her ear.  She yells at it on the floorboard.

       GRACIE
Love you!  Cant wait to see 
you!

SOPHIE 
Bye, Daddy!  We love you.

END CALL. Patrick notes the proprietor trying to price Clumsy.

             PATRIC
      What is that anyway?

             PROPRIETOR
      Stroumph.  How you say... Smurf?  
      Local legend, like Leprechaun.  
        (gives up scanning)
      Twenty euros?

                                             17.

             PATRICK
      Hes filthy.

             PROPRIETOR
      Is legend!  Fifteen.

             PATRICK
      How about ten?  Im stretched a 
      little thin here.

The proprietor glares.  Patrick SIGHS, tosses down the euros.

EXT. SOUVENIR TENT - MOMENTS LATER

As Patrick exits, we see Clumsy trapped in a clear souvenir 
box.  Patricks bosss droll, Asian, assistant, VAN, appears.

             VAN
      There you are.  
        (hustling Patrick along)
      Cmon.  Weve won Grand Prize for 
      Best Display, and Madames waiting.

             PATRICK
      Grand Prize?  Great.  Unless it'll 
      feed my family, you can have it.

             VAN
      Funny you should say that...

Van leads Patrick to a huge, gaudy, playhouse-like CHOCOLATE 
CASTLE.  Patricks dumfounded.  Their boss, ODILE LAURENT, 
commands the CROWD.  Stunning, charming, a modern-day Liz 
Arden, Odile doesnt just run her business, shes a star.  

             ODILE
        (gorgeous French accent)
      C'est bon!  Heres my marketing 
      genius.  Come claim your prize, mon 
      chri.  You deserve it.

She pulls him into a group photo in front of the CASTLE.

             PATRICK
        (through forced smile)
      What am I suppose to do with it?

             ODILE
      Keep smiling, mon cheri.  Lets not 
      offend our hosts.

The photo is snapped.  Patrick glad hands the BELGIANS.

                                             18.

ANGLE ON Clumsy, now partially free of the box.  Suddenly, he 
ducks back inside as something O.S. fills him with dread...

GARGAMEL and Azrael pass by, taking in the strange new world.

             GARGAMEL
      What manner of freakish realm is 
      this, Azrael?  Yet, even here, the 
      stench of Smurfs gives me goosebumps. 

ON GARGAMEL: he spots a tall, attractive NORDIC WOMAN.

             GARGAMEL (CONTD)
      You there!  Trollop!  Im searching 
      for these nasty blue creatures--

             NORDIC WOMAN
      What did you call me?

             GARGAMEL
      Trollop... tart, wench--

WHAP!  She decks him and marches off.  Gargamel rubs his face.  
His first touch by a woman, Gargamel tingles with a strange 
sensation.  He sits up, holding his heart.

             GARGAMEL (CONTD)
      Wait... You mystical, divine she-
      beast... Come back!  

EXT. TRADE SHOW - LAURENT BOOTH A LITTLE LATER

Van and other WORKERS pack up.  Patrick watches nervously as 
Odile studies a larger-than-life display poster of herself.  
After a beat, she turns abruptly and hands him a file.

             ODILE
      Patrick, mon coeur, I want you to 
      help get our Paris campaign back on 
      track.

             PATRICK

      Paris?

             ODILE
      Im not saying move there.  Just pop 
      over a week or two each month.

             PATRICK
        (flipping through file)
      Odile, I just promised my wife Id 
      talk to you about traveling less.

                                             19.

             ODILE
      And now you have.  Didnt you just 
      have another child?  What is that, 
      three now?  And a wife.  And a dog?  
      Oh, I cant imagine the pressures you 
      fathers must feel.

             PATRICK
        (unconvincing)
      Wouldnt have it any other way.

             ODILE
      Still, more travel, more money, 
      voila... less pressure.  Im only 
      thinking of you, mon, poulet.  And 
      only til my makeover of Europe takes 
      hold.  A year... two, tops.
        (on Patricks torn look)
      Trust me, Your lovely bride will 
      thank you in the end.
        (getting in Limo)
      See you at GlamourCon!

With a smile she leaves Patrick miserable in her wake.

EXT. EXHIBITION AREA - BEHIND THE BOOTHS - DAY - SAME

Papa and the Smurfs tiptoe like Navy Seals through a maze of 
cables and support gear.  Suddenly, Papa flashes a hold up 
sign.  The Smurfs stop, bumping each other in chain reaction.

             PAPA
      Alright everyone, think like Clumsy.

The Smurfs immediately adopt blank or dopey stares.  A few 
just plain fall down.  Papa just shakes his head.

             CLUMSY (O.S.)
        (faintly)
      Papa Smurf, Papa Smurf!

The Smurfs look up to see Clumsy, waving frantically from 
within his box as Van and Patrick load into a TAXI.  Gutsy 
leads a charge of several Smurfs for the Taxi.

             GUTSY
      Werrrrrre, comin ferrr ya Clumsy!

IN THE BOX: Clumsy desperately holds outstretched arms toward 
his comrades.  Then, his eyes go wide with fear...

CLUMSYS POV: Opposite Papa and the others, Gargamel and 
Azrael are staring right at him.


THE SMURFS - Stem & Weiss - 6/16/09 
                                             20.

             GARGAMEL
        (to Patrick)
      Stop!  Thief!  Thats my Smurf!

Gargamels cry is lost in the CROWD NOISE.  Oblivious, Patrick 
lowers a devastated Clumsy into the trunk.

Gargamel charges, but the Taxi pulls away, leaving him GASPING 
for breath... directly over the crestfallen Smurfs

His internal senses atingle, Gargamel looks down to see Gutsy 
and the others at his feet.

             SMURFS
        (fleeing)
      Yahhh!

Azrael gives a WAR CRY.  Master and cat charge their prey.

A free-for-all as Gargamel and Azrael chase Smurfs through 
various booths, wrecking displays and toppling exhibits.

Seeking refuge, Papa and the Smurfs race toward Patricks 
chocolate castle, imagining some great ruler must live there.

             PAPA
      Sanctuary, oh, benevolent lord!  
      Sanctuary for my little Smurumph--!

WHAP!  Papa trips on a TAPE GUN, tossed aside by FED EX 
WORKERS as they prep to ship the castle.  His face embedded in 
tape, Papas MUFFLED CRIES draw help from Hefty and Gutsy, who 
RIP him free, leaving some beard embedded in the tape.

             PAPA (CONTD)

      Oooouch!

With Gargamel bearing down, Gutsy and Hefty help Papa as they 
charge after the others INTO THE CASTLE.

             GUTSY
      Lower the gate!

The chocolate gate wheel breaks off.  Greedy takes a bite. 

             GREEDY

      Mmmmm!

Suddenly, their world goes BLACK as a cargo lid is lowered 
onto the castle. WHAM! Gargamel face-plants against the crate.

A FEDEX GUY secures the lid while his PARTNER labels it with 
the tape gun. The container is hoisted. Gargamel leaps for it.


THE SMURFS - Stem & Weiss - 6/16/09 
                                             21.

             GARGAMEL
      No!  My Smurfs!  Mine!  Miiiine!

He falls on his back, clutching a shred of label and tape, the 
wind knocked out of him.

             FEDEX WORKER
      And theyll absolutely positively be 
      there overnight. 

The worker exits.  Gargamel examines the shred of label and 
tape. It features Patrics Company LOGO: LAURENT and USA.  
Gargamel calls to a PASSERBY.

             GARGAMEL
      You, knave!  Pray tell, where is the 
      Usa of these sacred writings?

             PASSERBY
      Uh... About 4,000 miles that way?

             GARGAMEL
      And how many doubloons does one need 
      for mule passage to this, Usa? 

             PASSERBY
      Does your mule fly?

             GARGAMEL
        (bewildered)
      A flying mule?

Just then... a 777 ROARS overhead.  Gargamel covers his head 
in terror.  Then... A crooked smile creaks across his face.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

INT. AIRPLANE - SUNSET

Patrick tries to get comfortable in his seat.  Finally, he 
pulls Clumsy from the souvenir box, looks him over, then 
stuffs him behind his head as a neck pillow.

CLOSE ON: Clumsy, his face mashed into the window.  His eyes 
go wide as the earth pulls away 15,000 feet below him.  Hes 
on his way to... Usa.

                                 FADE OUT.

INT. BRUSSELS INTL AIRPORT - TICKET COUNTER - DAY

Gargamel argues with a Belgian TICKET AGENT.

             GARGAMEL
      But I demand passage on your terrible 
      winged beast!

             TICKET AGENT                
      Sir, no passport, no ticket.

Catching sight of a HUGE WOMAN loading a tiny dog into a 
carrier, Gargamel suddenly calms down.

             GARGAMEL
      Yes, of course.   Wouldnt want to 
      take up too much room in the belly of 
      your flying machine.

He steps away from the counter and begins rummaging in his 
magic bag.  Azreal MEWS, confused by Gargamels sly smile.

INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT

A perfectly quiet, normal flight.  A MAN gets up to retrieve 
his laptop from the overhead bin.

INT. OVERHEAD BIN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

The bin opens.  In the dark far end, a pocket in a carry-on 
WRIGGLES.  A tiny MEOW, then, a TINY Gargamel and Azrael shove 
a SNICKERS BAR aside and peek out from the pocket.

             TINY GARGAMEL
      Of course, I thought this through.  
      Its a standard Class A Shrinking 
      Spell.  What could go wrong?

Azrael MEOWS as his tail suddenly grows to full size.

             GARGAMEL

      Oh, dear.

INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

In a FLASH of SMOKE and LIGHT, life-sized Gargamel and Azrael 
tumble out of the overhead bin.  People SCREAM, panicked by 
the explosion and smoky man, face-down in the aisle.

             GARGAMEL
      Its okay, Im a wizard.

             PASSENGER
        (re smoky robe)
      Hes got a bomb!

Gargamel sits up just as a FLIGHT ATTENDANT rams him in the 
face with the drink cart and everyone jumps him.

EXT. WINSLOW NEIGHBORHOOD - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT 

A taxi pulls up outside a slightly-neglected upper middle-
class house in Englewood, New Jersey.

At the front door, Patrick collects forgotten mail, mostly 
bills.  The mailbox lid comes off in his hand.  He SIGHS.

INT. WINSLOW HOUSE - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

The door latch JIGGLES and SHAKES.  Finally the stuck door is 
shouldered open and Patrick enters with his bags.  He slips 
his shoes off and tip toes up the stairs, noting swatches of 
PAINT SAMPLES remaining from unfinished tests, long ago. 

IN SamS ROOM -- Patrick tousles his sons hair and slides a 
new snow globe on the desk -- beside a row of similar snow 
globes Patricks brought back from all over the world. 

IN SOPHIES ROOM -- Patrick finds his young daughter asleep in 
her princess bed.  Patrick slides Clumsy beneath one arm, then 
kisses her on the head.  Sophie stirs just enough to notice 
the gift and smile.  Patrick smiles, too, and exits.

Clumsys eyes pop open.  He tries to squirm free, but Sophie 
rolls over, pinning him beneath her chest.  Hes struggles, 
but cant move.  Exhausted, he lays back and passes out.

IN THE MASTER BEDROOM -- Patrick quietly undresses and readies 
to climb into bed beside a clearly exhausted Gracie.  He steps 
on a toy, which launches into SONG, waking baby Reina, who 
bursts into tears.  Gracie starts to get up.

             PATRICK

      I got it.

Exhausted, Patrick soothes the baby, alone, as Gracie, 
grateful, falls back into bed, dead to the world.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

INT. JFK INTL AIRPORT - U.S. CUSTOMS - DAWN

SECURITY, IMMIGRATIONS and a LUFTHANSA AGENT argue as Gargamel 
watches anxiously in the background. 

             LUFTHANSA AGENT
      Were not flying back a terrorist!  
      Thats your jurisdiction!

             CUSTOMS OFFICER

Whos your supervisor?

CUSTOMS OFFICER
Whos your supervisor?!

As they grab phones and dial angrily, Gargamel simply takes 
his bag and cat and blends into a line cleared for exit.

INT. JFK - TERMINAL - DAWN

Several DRIVERS hold name placards, awaiting their passenger. 
Gargamel approaches one, reading Smith. 

             ARMENIAN DRIVER

             GARGAMEL

      Smith?

      Smurf.

      Who sent you?  What do you know of 
      these runes?

             FOREIGN LIMO DRIVER
        (re shipping label)
      Ees in city, Meester Smoorf?  You 
      vant stop zhere first?

             GARGAMEL
      Yesssss, my speaking-impaired friend.  
      I vant stop zhere first.

The driver tries to take his bag.  Gargamel yanks it back.

INT. SOPHIES ROOM - DAWN

Clumsy YAWNS and stretches in the first morning light.  
Suddenly, he jolts awake, no idea where he is.  

Inching from beneath Sophie, he takes in the giant princess, 
then backs into something wet.  He turns and stares into the 
sleeping snout of Tarzan, the beagle.  

Clumsy backs into a pile of toys, burying himself in an 
avalanche of lifeless, horrifying DOLL FACES.  Worst of all, 
SNIFF SNIFF... Tarzan GROWLS.  Sophie SHUSHES in her sleep...

             SOPHIE
      Tarzaamb... shubbshsssh.

Clumsy goes to scream, but merely PEEPS, then he flees into...

                                             25.

INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Clumsy heaves the great door closed, then scales the sink 
cabinet, to get further from Tarzan, who paws at the door.  

ON THE COUNTER: Clumsy collapses to catch his breath.  After a 
beat, he SNIFFS something sweet and follows his nose to... the 
BERRY-BURST liquid HAND SOAP.  

Famished, he sucks down a mouthful, then grimaces, BURPING a 
huge BUBBLE.  Stepping back, he triggers the BLOW DRYER which 
sets him running in place in pool of slippy soap.  

Reaching for support, Clumsy yanks the plug and all is QUIET.  
He spots a crystal pool, below and climbs eagerly down...

INTO THE TOILET: HUMMING happily, Clumsy enjoys a quick splash 
under the arms and a GARGLE.  Ahh, refreshing.  To climb out, 
he grabs the handle... FLUSH!

Flailing wildly for balance, Clumsy grab the toilet paper, 
which unfurls as he falls toward the raging whirlpool below.

Just as he would be lost, hes plucked free.  Clumsy looks up 
from Sophies grasp to see her towering over him in her 
princess jammies.  He tries freezing again.

             SOPHIE
      I know youre alive... I saw you.  

Clumsy cant contain another BURP and BUBBLE. Sophia giggles.

             SOPHIE (CONTD)

      See.

Clumsy throws himself on his face.

             CLUMSY
      Please your highness, dont hurt me!  
      Ill do whatever you say!  I didnt 
      mean to wake you.  I just want to go 
      home!  

             SOPHIE
      You silly.  Id never hurt you.  Why 
      would I hurt you?
        (as Clumsy peeks up)
      But, I would take care of you... If 
      you let me.

Tarzan SNIFFS and jumps ups, curious, as Sophie reaches to pet 
Clumsy.  Clumsy pulls back, afraid.

             SOPHIE (CONTD)
      Dont be scared.  Its just Tarzan.  
      Hes a good dog.  Are you hungry?  
      Ill bet you are.  Im hungry.

Against his will, Clumsy nods.  Sophie warmly smiles.

             SOPHIE (CONTD)
      You like breakfast in bed? I love it. 

He nods again.  As she pulls him close and starts out, Clumsy 
stiffens, but then... he cant resist a much needed cuddle.

INT. TOWN CAR - MANHATTAN - SAME

Azrael and Gargamel each hang out the window like a dogs, 
taking in the Big Apple.  They are mesmerized by billboards 
and jumbotrons touting beauty, fashion and youth.  

Noting the limos decanter, Gargamel takes a swig, then spit 
takes all over the back of the limo.  

Meanwhile, an ANGRY STREAM OF ARMENIAN comes from DISPATCH.  

             FOREIGN LIMO DRIVER
      Smith?  At JFK??  No Smurth?

He glares at Gargamel, who is licking the picture on a pack of 
peanuts.  

EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST - EARLY MORNING

Gargamel, his cat, bag and crumpled shipping label are tossed 
from the car.  The driver, CURSING IN ARMENIAN, speeds away.

                                 SLAM TO:

             GARGAMEL
      Lunatic demon!  Im keeping your 
      peanuts!!

Seeing the shipping label floating in the gutter, toward a 
storm drain, Gargamel leaps and grabs them.

             GARGAMEL (CONTD)
      Ye gods, the runes!  

Azrael YOWLS sniffing at the label. 

             GARGAMEL (CONTD)
      What now, cat?

                                             27.

Gargamel examines the tape more closely... FINE BITS OF GREY 
HAIR are embedded within.  Pushing Azrael aside, Gargamels 
eyes go wide with excitement...

             GARGAMEL (CONTD)
      Praise all darkness!  Papas beard!  
      Its not much, but even a smidgen of 
      Smurf, in the right hands, should 
      yield power and riches beyond belief.

Gargamel eyes a Porta Potty near a renovation project.

             GARGAMEL (CONTD)
      Ahh, this should make a nice 
      laboratory in which to tease the 
      powers from these precious strands.

They enter the Porta Potty.  After a beat... SNIFF...MEOW!

             GARGAMEL (O.S.) (CONTD)
      I agree.  Someones been working a 
      dark and terrible magic in here.

They quickly stagger out, GASPING.

                                 WIPE TO:

EXT. TURTLE POND/BELVEDERE CASTLE - MOMENTS LATER

Gargamel and Azrael stomp through the shrubs and come upon  
BELVEDERE CASTLE -- a rundown architectural folly, amazingly 
like his home.  He smiles.

Gargamel bashes the LOCK open with a ROCK and peers into the 
cob-webbed labyrinth of old park junk... Its perfect.

             GARGAMEL
      Oh, baby... Daddys home. 

INT. WINSLOW KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING

Patrick sits, absently feeding the baby, while studying a 
FRENCH BOOK in the other.  He struggles with a sentence.

             PATRICK
      Bonjour, Reina.  Vous aimez Cherrios?

Sam sits nearby, repairing his HELICOPTER, also lost in his 
own world.  The copter struggles to lift off.

             PATRICK (CONTD)
      Hey hey, Sam, not in the house.  

Earbuds blaring, Sam doesnt hear.  Patrick plucks out a bud.

             SAM

      Sam.

      What?

             PATRICK
      No flying in the house.  What were 
      you thinking, anyway, taking that 
      thing to school?

             SAM
      Where am I supposed to fly it?  We 
      never go to the park like you said we 
      would when we got it.

             PATRICK
      I know, I know, and Ive been meaning 
      to.  Its just... things are so crazy 
      right now with work and the economy--

             SAM
      Whatever...
        (cranking earbuds back up)
      Tell Principal Fincher I said hi, 
      tonight.

             SOPHIE
        (racing in, hugs Patrick)
      Daddy, I love him!  Thank you so 
      much!

She spins, to reveal Clumsy in a baby carrier on her back.  

             SOPHIE (CONTD)
        (racing in)
      His name is Clumsy and he talks and 
      walks and swims in the potty.  But 
      hes so hungry.  Why didnt you feed 
      him on the plane?

Gracie enters, as Sophie gathers a lot of food.  Patrick 
quickly hides the French book.

             GRACIE
      Feed who on the plane?

             SOPHIE
      My Smurf.  Daddy got him in Brussels 
      and he lives in a mushroom in the 
      middle of the woods.

She races out with tray of food.  Gracie turns to Patrick.

             GRACIE
      Wow, what a difference.  My first 
      full night of sleep since you left.
        (then)
      Whats with the tie?  I thought I had 
      you to myself today. 

             PATRICK
      Yeah... Ive just got a little 
      catching up to do from the trip.

Hiding her frustration, Gracie turns away to pour coffee.

             GRACIE
      So... Did you talk to Odile about 
      travel?

             PATRICK
        (deep breath...)
      Yeah, as a matter of fact, I did. 

             GRACIE

      And?

Looking into Gracies beautiful, hope-filled eyes...

             PATRICK

      And... 
        (courage failing)
      ...Theres definitely going to be 
      some changes.

             GRACIE
        (beat, hugs him)
      You... are my hero.

She kisses him on the cheek and exits.  Patrick wilts, then 
flips through his French book and reads for the baby...

             PATRICK
      Je suis si bais.
        (SUBTITLE: I am so screwed)

INT. THE WINSLOWS BACKYARD - MORNING - A LITTLE LATER

Poor Tarzan is now chained up and watches forlornly as a FED 
EX CREW maneuver a huge box.  Dropping it, they quickly exit.

UPSTAIRS: Patrick packs up his computer for work.  Spotting 
the box in the backyard, he brightens...

EXT. BACKYARD - SAME

PUSH IN ON the box.  After a beat...

                                             30.

             BRAINY (O.S.)
      I could be mistaken, but its my 
      opinion, that weve come to a stop.

             PAPA (O.S.)
      Thank you, Brainy, for that piercing 
      and insightful observation.

INT. BOX - CONTINUOUS

A shaft of light from a crack in the container illuminates the 
weary travellers.

       GREEDY
Real Food... Must have real 
food.

HEFTY
Water!  My bench press for a 
drop of water.

       GUTSY
Me ferrst, lads. Might be any 
manner of monster oot dar.

VANITY
A drop?  Bathe me in a river, 
I smell like a moose.

             SMURFETTE
      Forgive a lady for being blunt, 
      fellas, but, if I dont find a powder 
      room, my smurf is gonna burst.

EXT. WINSLOW BACK YARD - SECONDS LATER

Papa peers from the crack in the container, then cautiously 
ventures into this unknown world.  One by one, hes followed 
by tired, frightened, chocolate-covered Smurfs. 

Suddenly a massive dinosaur head looms over them.  The Smurfs 
SCREAM and flee toward a rickety fence.  Behind them, the 
plastic dinosaur rocks in the wind as part of a swingset. 

The Smurfs are cut off by Tarzan, who BARKS and chases them 
back toward the house until hes snapped back by his sliding 
chain.  The back door flies open and Patrick leads his family 
out.  The Smurfs dive under a hedge.

             PATRICK
        (to Gracie, proudly)
      Bet you thought I forgot you, eh?

SMURFS POV: Patrick undoes a strap, releasing the wooden sides 
of the crate, revealing... a half-eaten chocolate mess.

             PATRICK (CONTD)
      Okay, giant chocolate castles do not 
      travel well.

             SOPHIE
      Hmmm.  Looks like you had rats.

                                             31.

UNDER HEDGE: Greedy BURPS, wiping chocolate off his hands.  

             SAM
      If I catch the plague, will that get 
      me out of mid-terms? 

SMURFS POV: As the family heads back into the house, Clumsy 
is revealed, strapped to a Baby Bjorn on Sophies back.  

The Smurfs GASP.  Gutsy lunges, but Hefty grabs him.  Clumsy 
reaches out hopelessly to Papa, who frantically signals to 
SHUSH him.  Tarzan BARKS and pulls on his chain, loosening the 
stake as the door SLAMS and Clumsys gone.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

INT. BELVEDERE CASTLE - DUNGEON - AFTERNOON

More haggard than ever, Gargamel and Azrael have worked 
feverishly, refashioning the castle into a crude laboratory.  
A candle churns smoky brew in an old coffee urn into VAPOR, 
which pulses through a Rube Goldberg-esque rig.

             GARGAMEL
      This is it, Azrael.  All my life has 
      built to this moment. 
        (accidently BREAKS WIND)
      Alright, this next moment... The 
      piece de la resistance, the creme de 
      la creme...

MUSIC builds as Gargamel produces the tuft of Papas beard and 
adds the hair to the urn... The room is engulfed in SFX. 

             GARGAMEL (CONTD)
      Yes! YES!  Never again will they 
      laugh at Gargamel!

Gargamel places a tiny, exquisite glass cordial at the  
funnel, capturing a wee squirt of Smurf-blue ESSENCE. 

             GARGAMEL (CONTD)
      At last, the ultimate magic potion... 
      Essence du Smurf!.

He pours a drop onto a crumpled COKE CAN, turning it to GOLD.

             GARGAMEL (CONTD)
        (in ecstacy)
      Oooo!  Eeee!  Aaaah!... Shiiiney!
        (Azrael licks the gold).
      Stoppit, cretin!

Gargamel polishes the bar... then licks it himself.

             GARGAMEL (CONTD)
      Mmmmm!  Were going to require more 
      Smurfs.

INT. WINSLOW KITCHEN - DAY

Sophie feeds Clumsy, who stares over her shoulder, distracted.  

             SOPHIE
      Are you okay?  Is your seat buckle 
      too tight?

             CLUMSY
      No, its... its... Papa Smurf! 

Sophie follows Clumsys stare to the doggie door, where Papa 
freezes, half in/half out, being lowered by Hefty and Gutsy.

                                  CUT TO:

INT. BABYS ROOM - 2ND FLOOR - SECONDS LATER

Gracie changes baby Reina, who CRIES and fusses, gnawing on a 
rattle.  Sophie bursts in, talking 100 mph.

             SOPHIE
      Mommy!  Clumsys friends have come 
      and the poor little Smurfs have had 
      nothing but Chocolate for days and 
      theyre all hopped up on sugar and 
      need a real breakfast and a lot of 
      it, and a bath, cause they smell 
      like frog poop.  Can they come in?  
      Please?  I promise to take care of 
      them?  Please please?

             GRACIE
        (wrestling Reinas diaper)
      Sure, Sophie.  Clutzys friends can 
      have breakfast.  Say hello from me.

             SOPHIE
      Thanks, Mom!

INT. WINSLOW KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 

Smurfs are... everywhere.  Bathing in the sink, showering 
under the spray faucet.  Fire-brigade style, some empty the 
fridge.  Others beat on the toaster, raid the pantry, roast 
treats over stove burners and spin on bar stools.  Greedy 
emerges from a bag of CHEETOS... Hes ORANGE.

             GREEDY
        (BUUUUUURP)
      Smurfacalifragilous.

With Clumsy happily at his side, Papa, on the counter, 
oversees the feeding of his family with Brainys help.

             CLUMSY
      Then I woke up under Sophies arm and 
      shes kept me safe every since.      

             PAPA
        (bowing to Sophie)
      How can we ever thank you?

             SOPHIE
      Dont need to.  Its just so nice to 
      have someone to talk to for a change.     

             PAPA
      Clumsy, are you feeling okay?  You 
      look a little pale.

Clumsy checks his arms. Hes a bit less blue than the others.

             PAPA (CONTD)
      No worries.  Fortunately, I packed 
      extra smurfberries.

Producing a pouch, he pops a berry into Clumsys mouth.

             CLUMSY
        (noticably relieved)
      Aaaaaaah.  Thanks, Papa Smurf.

             BRAINY (O.S.)
      Watch it, Handy!  Papa always says... 
      Youre gonna poke someones eye out 
      with that thiiiiiiiing...

Brainy sails off a spinning orange, atop a JUICER as Handy and 
others wield a LARGE KNIFE on the next orange.  Hefty helps 
load it and Gutsy jumps on top and clings as it spins.

             SOPHIE
      Thats it!  Keep pressing down!

       DARING
(spining on orange)
Yeeeehaaaaw!

Amazing!

Four hungry Smurfs peer into a FOUR-SLICE TOASTER.

             SOPHIE (CONTD)
      You might not want to stand quite so-- 

DING!  The Smurfs are knocked to their butts by flying toast. 

             PAPA
        (mouthful of eggs)
      Mmmmm.  Youre sure your Mother wont 
      mind all this, Miss Sophie?

             SOPHIE
      Mind?  She loves Clumsy.  And just 
      wait til she meets all of you.

The room is pierced by an hysterical SCREAM.

ANGLE ON Gracie, in the doorway, holding Reina and freaking 
out.  The Smurfs, shocked by the sight, SCREAM back as one, 
then, run panicked in every direction.

             SOPHIE (CONTD)
      Its okay!  Thats my mom!  Mom!  You 
      said it was okay!

Sam rushes in and is stunned to see the kitchen packed with 
scampering, keystone cop-like, little blue critters.

             SAM
      Omigod... Aliens!

             GRACIE
      Sophie, get back!

In one clean move, she puts the baby in Sams arms, grabs a 
broom, and clears a counter of little blue invaders.   

             SOPHIE
      Stop it!  Mom, we invited them! 

Wham!  Gracie sweeps Brainy into wall.  WHOOSH!  GUTSY is sent 
flying onto the ceiling fan.

       BRAINY
Aaaaaaaaaagh!

GUTSY
Weeeeeeeeeee!

             GRACIE
        (swatting more Smurfs)
      Get... Out... of my... Kitchen!

                                             35.

Papa ducks a swipe.  Sophie grabs Gracies legs.  Tarzan leaps 
through his doggy door, pulling his up-ended stake.  WHAM!  It 
catches in the door, jerking him short of Gutsy.

             GUTSY
        (shadow boxing)
      Is at all ya got!  Brrring it on, 
      you canine cowarrrd!

As Tazan cocks his head, confused, Sam traps Gutsy under a 
glass cake cover.  He holds it down as Gutsy shoves back.

             GUTSY (MUFFLED) (CONTD)
      Let me oot ya frrreakin jeezer!

      I thought you were playing!

             SMURFETTE
        (trying to revive Brainy)
      Look what youve done to my Brainy.

Stunned, Gracie pauses for a beat.  Sophie grabs the broom.

             SOPHIE
      Mom!  They need our help! Theyre 
      nice!  Papa!  Show Mom youre nice!

Sophie and Gracie clutch the broom in a standoff.  Gracie 
stares warily at Papa.  He stares warily back.  Then...

             PAPA
        (tentatively)
      Alright my little Smurfs... Clean up 
      time.  And make it Smurfy.

Keeping an eye on Gracie, Smurfs come out of hiding to clean.  
Soon, the kitchen is a BLUE BLUR as things are polished and 
put away at break-neck speed.  Gracie and the kids are dazed.

Gracie is eased into a chair and served tea.  Catching her 
breath, she looks around in awe.  Standing at attention, the 
Smurfs line the kitchen like the wait-crew of a luxury liner.  

             SOPHIE
      Mom, meet Papa...and the Smurfs.

      Humbly at your service, mlady.

The Smurfs bow.  The Winslows are speechless.  Reina grabs 
Grouchy and happily chews on him, covering him in slime. 

             GROUCHY
      I hate being at service...

             GRACIE
      Nooo!  Get that out--

Gracie yanks Grouchy from Reina and hurls him into the sudsy 
sink, then wipes Reinas mouth.

             GRACIE (CONTD)
      Who knows what kind of diseases these 
      things--
        (off Reinas YOWLING)
      No, Reina, we do not put strangers in 
      our mouth.

Crazy steps forward and sooths Reina with a RIFF of silly 
NOISES.  Reina GIGGLES, delighted.  Gracies taken aback. 

             SAM
      Im so uploading this to YouTube.

As he records Crazy, Sophie grabs his phone-cam. 

        SAM
Hey! Give it! Theyre not 
yours!  This is first contact!  
The worlds gotta know!

SOPHIE
Stopit!  They need our help! 
Can they stay, Mom?  Please?  
Just for a little while?

Sam holds Gutsy up at arms length, captivated as the little 
blue alien swings wildly at him.  Mom gazes into rows of 
pleading Smurf eyes.

             PAPA
        (humbly beseeching)
      We are a long way from home, Maam.

             BRAINY
      And experience indicates, its a bit 
      dangerous out there for Smurfs.  

             HEFTY
      For once, I agree with Brainy.

             PAPA
      Well be out of your hair in no time.  
      When the Blue Moon rises, we simply 
      search out the nearest portal and--

             GRACIE
      Im sorry, did you say, Blue Moon?

             PAPA
      Yes, when the moon turns blue and 
      rises in the evening sky--

             SAM
      Whoa, I dont know what planet youre 
      from, but our moon doesnt turn blue.

Papa looks alarmed.

             GRACIE
      We have an expression Blue Moon, but 
      thats just when its full twice in 
      the same month. 

             SMURFETTE
      With just a lovely hint of blue?

             SAM
      What part of no blue dont you guys 
      understand?

Rows of solid blue Smurfs gaze back at him, blankly.

             BRAINY

      All of it?

EXT. MADISON AVE. - DAY - AFTERNOON

Armed with the gold, Gargamel and Azrael push through CROWDS 
to gaze, flumoxed, at Armani suits in the windows at BARNEYS.

             GARGAMEL
      Ludicrous!  Wheres a brilliant 
      wizard to find a simple hairy robe?

He smooths his filthy robe, then, his jaw drops...

RACK FOCUS: Reflected in the window is Patricks Company logo, 
on the office building across the street.

Gargamel turns and charges into traffic causing utter chaos.

INT. LAURENT INTL HEADQUARTERS - LOBBY BOUTIQUE - AFTERNOON

Expansive, exclusive, like Lancmes HQ, its Niketown for 
your face.  Deep in the lobby, Odile berates her MINIONS.

             ODILE
        (re a display)
      Dieu m'aide, Im so bored.

                                             38.

             ODILE (CONT'D)
      The press expects Laurent to surprise 
      at GlamourCon.  Yet, Ive seen all 
      this before.  Deja vu does not sell.

AT THE ENTRANCE: Gargamel spots an impeccably dressed, middle-
aged, COSMETOLOGIST, cream-treating her crows feet in vain.

             GARGAMEL
      You there, fancy woman.  Fetch me the 
      proprietor of this bazar at once.

Gargamel and Azrael seem homeless and feral at best.  The 
cosmetologist beckons to an undercover SECURITY AGENT.    

             SECURITY AGENT
      Sir, please step outside.

Gargamel struggles as hes pulled toward the door.

             GARGAMEL
      Unhand me, knave!  Or youll live out 
      your days as newt! 
        (as guard tightens grip)
      Or perhaps another small amphibious 
      reptile of your fancy?

In their struggle, the vial empties onto the cosmetologist.

             GARGAMEL (CONTD)
      Ye, gods!  My potion!

A youth effect spreads over the cosmetologist.  She SHIVERS 
with pleasure as her face, bust, hair, and entire being, 
become 25 years younger.  Gargamel is himself, surprised.

             COSMETOLOGIST
        (looking into the mirror)
      (stunned expletives in Farsi)

             GARGAMEL
      Well, I hope youre happy.  You were 
      a perfectly respectable hag, yet you 
      wasted my fine blue brew turning 
      yourself into a strumpet!

             ODILE (O.S.)
      Sacr Blu!...  Mother?!

Gargamel turns, to find Odile gazing in shock at her mother, 
the cosmetologist, newly restored to youth.  

             ODILE (CONTD)
      Comment?... Que?... qui?


THE SMURFS - Stem & Weiss - 6/16/09 
                                             39.

Odiles mother points, wordlessly to Gargamel.  As Odile 
stares at him, Gargamel melts, utterly taken in by the most 
beautiful woman hes ever seen. 

             ODILE (CONTD)
      Who are you?  How did you do this?

             GARGAMEL
      I... I... well... Obviously, my 
      potion is more amazing than even I 
      expected. 

             ODILE
      Can you do it again?

She reaches for his empty bottle.  Gargamel clutches it.

             GARGAMEL
        (re her mother)
      W-why would I do that again?

             ODILE
      Dont play coy.  Women would kill for 
      a drop of that.  

             GARGAMEL

      Women?

Shrewdly changing tacks, she draws closer, stroking his cheek 
with a perfectly manicured finger.  She speaks seductively...

             ODILE
      Of course, a man as charming as 
      yourself is probably bored silly by 
      the attention of beautiful women. 

             GARGAMEL
        (enraptured, dazed)
      Oh.  Yes, its so... wearying... 
      always being the object... of desire.  

             ODILE
      Tout de suite, everyone!  Get the man 
      a latte!  Caviar!  A massage!  His 
      any desire!  How often are we graced 
      by the presence of such genius?

Azrael MEOWS in confusion.  Gargamel stomps on his tail, 
shutting him up, but never turning his gaze from Odiles.

             GARGAMEL
        (overcome)
      Im sorry... Did you say... genius?

Odile locks eyes with the strange man before her.  

             ODILE
      Unequivocal... Totalement... Genius.  

Enveloped in a whirlwind of pampering and grovel, Gargamels 
eyes fill with gratitude, his greatness, at last, recognized.

             GARGAMEL
      Azrael, were going to like it here.

INT. 540 PARK RESTAURANT - DAY

Odile and Van sit across from Gargamel and Azrael in the power-
lunchroom to midtowns elite. 

             ODILE 
      Monsieur Gargamel, Ill be frank.  
      Clinique, Lauder, Mac, theyd kill to 
      get what you have in that vial.

             GARGAMEL
        (keeping an eye out)
      To be expected.  Ill need some 
      bowman and a few good knights, 
      preferably in shining armor.

Odile starts to laugh, but realizes hes not joking.

             ODILE 
      Done.  Van.  

             VAN
      Where would I--

             ODILE
      You see, Monsieur Gargamel, while 
      others may promise you the world, 
      Odile Laurent delivers. 

A huge, almost medieval tray of meats arrives.  Gargamel digs 
into a turkey leg and Azrael devours prawns. 

             ODILE (CONTD)
      Of course, all our testing will be 
      animal cruelty free. 

             GARGAMEL
      So, I pay extra for animal cruelty?


THE SMURFS - Stem & Weiss - 6/16/09 
                                             41.

             ODILE
      And we assume liability should your 
      formula present any... unforeseen 
      side effects.

             GARGAMEL
      Speaking of unforeseen, this place 
      hasnt got a pot to piss in.
        (to waiter)
      You!  Urchin!  Fetch me a chamber 
      pot.  This swill you call Cristal has 
      gone straight to my nether region.

             ODILE 
        (off waiters look)
      Get. The man. A chamberpot.

             GARGAMEL
      Thank the gods...

Gargamel grabs an empty SOUP TUREEN from a passing tray and 
disappears behind a potted plant.  Odile smiles and nods at 
perplexed DINERS as if nothing is wrong.  

Relieved, Gargamel hands the pot to the Waiter. 

             GARGAMEL (CONTD)
      Toss this out a window, will you?

             ODILE
      Gargamel, dahling, you can get me 
      another sample of your incredible 
      potion for tomorrow, mais oui?  Id 
      like to unveil you to the world at 
      GlamourCon.  Theyll worship you.

             GARGAMEL
      Hear that, Azrael?  Worshiiiip.  It 
      rolls off her tongue, like flesh from 
      a martyr.

Azrael GULPS down a prawn than BURPS in agreement.  Eying a 
huge aquarium he jumps in and paddles madly for a bite.  The 
staff rushes to pull him out, but Odile waves them off.

             ODILE
      Le poisson... Add it to the bill.
        (then, to Gargamel)
      So, we have a deal, my liege?

             GARGAMEL
      Your liege?  Oh yes, yes!  Ill 
      gladly provide you more potion.  
      Theres just one thing...

                                             42.

Gargamel produces the crumpled shipping label and begins 
smoothing it on the table.

             GARGAMEL (CONTD)
      You see, there was this box, and 
      something most dear to me was--

             ODILE 
        (glancing at the label)
      Ah, thats shipping and receiving.  
      Van will take you, tout de suit!

             GARGAMEL
      No, youre too sweet. 

             ODILE
      Van, make sure you get his number.

             GARGAMEL

      My what?

             ODILE
      Your cellular?  
        (off his blank look)
      You do have a phone, dont you?  Of 
      course you dont, you dont even have 
      a comb.  Van.

Van reluctantly hands over his phone.

             ODILE (CONTD)
      Until tomorrow, mon cher.

Rising to leave, she holds out her hand.  Garamel sniffs it 
tentatively, then licks it like an obedient dog.  She smiles.   

             ODILE (CONTD)
      Yes, I think this is going to work 
      out just fine. 

INT. WINSLOW HOME - STUDY - DAY

Sophie helps Papa and Brainy pour through the library, while 
Gracie searches online and keeps an eye on Reina, who bounces 
happily in her springy chair as Crazy entertains her with 
funny noises: CRICKETS, WASHING MACHINE, an ELEPHANT, etc.

             GRACIE
      See, this is a blue moon in our 
      world.  Its really just a saying.

Brainy and Papa peer at photo of a full moon over New York.

      Thats not even blue if you squint!

Smurfs MURMUR worriedly as Papas nervously paces.

             PAPA
      Alright, nobody panic.  There must be 
      a way to summon a Blue Moon.  Hmmm... 
      Ill need to study your stars.

      Fine.  But Im coming with in case 
      you try and summon your mothership 
      for an attack. 

             SMURFETTE
      Mothership?
        (to the Winslow girls)
      What a delightfully feminine culture.

She proudly smooths her dress on her curves as the Smurfs all 
SIGH with desire and Papa rolls his eyes. 

INT. LAURENT INTL - CORPORATE OFFICES - NY - LOBBY

Gargamel and Azrael sit in reception.  Gargamel tries to snap 
a picture of Azrael with the Vans phone.  Instead, he blinds 
himself with the flash.  A SHIPPING CLERK crosses to them.

             SHIPPING GUY
      Nothing from Belgium.  Sure it came 
      to this address? 

DING!  Gargamel and Azrael are astounded as an elevator opens 
and people appear.  More amazing, Patrick is among them.  They 
eagerly sneak after him to the street.

EXT. MONTHLY CAR PARK - MOMENTS LATER

Patrick emerges in his Smart car.  Gargamel spots an empty 
HORSE AND CARRIAGE waiting on its dining tourists.  The DRIVER 
stands nearby, reading...

EXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE / INT. CAR - AFTERNOON 

Patrick crawls along in slow traffic. Unnoticed in his 
rearview mirror, Gargamel and Azraels gain on him in the 
carriage.  Gargamel whips a guy in a convertible Porsche.

             GARGAMEL
      Move aside, peasant!  How dare you 
      obstruct my path to greatness!

Impatient, Gargamel side-swipes the Porsche, Ben-Hur style, 
leaving the angry driver in his wake.

EXT. ENGLEWOOD - NJ - EVENING

Patrick slows to turn into a quiet neighborhood.  Gargamels 
horse CLOMPS into view behind him stops.

             GARGAMEL
      No!  Dont stop!  Were so close!  I 
      can feeeeel it!

The horse keels over, into a SNORING slumber, flipping the 
carriage and ejecting Gargamel.

             GARGAMEL (CONTD)
      Infidel quitter! Four-legged Judas!

He begins to CRY inconsolably, Azrael CRIES with him.

Sophie stares out the window.  Suddenly...

      Places everyone!

OUTSIDE: Patricks car pulls into the driveway.

EXT. WINSLOW HOME - FRONT PORCH - SAME

Patrick checks the mail, pleasantly surprised that the mailbox 
top doesnt come off in his hand.  

He starts to give the door a shove, but, to his surprise, it 
swings open with no effort.  Its not sticking any more.

             PATRICK
      Honey, I fixed the door!

      ...And the coat rack.
        (noticing)
      And painted the hall?

The house looks amazing.

INT. DINING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON 

The family stands around Patrick, who sits at the table, 
staring dumbfounded at Clumsy.  Clumsy looks to Sophie, 
anxious to understand Patricks expression.

             GRACIE

      More wine?

Clumsy slides Patricks glass toward Gracie, who refills it as 
Clumsy tries a deep bow, but clumsily tips over instead.   

             CLUMSY
      Oops.  Guess Im still a bit stiff 
      from you using me as a neck pillow.

      Well... A few more came over in your 
      chocolate disaster.

Patrick looks to Gracie.

             GRACIE
      Right... Um, okay... Papa Smurf?

From behind the flowers, out steps Papa.  He bows.

             PAPA
      At your service, Master Winslow.

Patrick takes a GULP of wine.

             SOPHIE
      And theres Smurfette...

Smurfette appears from behind a pitcher and curtseys.

             SMURFETTE
      Swell place you got her, Mr. W.  
      Makes a lady feel right at home.

Instinctively, she innocently flirts with batting eyes, 
startling Patrick, even more.

             SOPHIE
      Shes the only girl.

             PATRICK

      Good.

             SOPHIE
      Then, theres Hefty and Greedy and 
      Vanity and Crazy and Romeo and Brainy 
      -- he thinks hes the smartest, but 
      Im not so sure.

As Sophie speaks, the Smurfs appear from behind picture 
frames, potted plants and tea pots.  Patrick is flabbergasted. 

             SAM
        (picking up Brainy)
      They claim to come in peace, but Im 
      watching em.  Feel their skin.  

             BRAINY
      I demand that you cease at once--
        (GIGGLES at a belly rub)
      Okay, wait, do that again.

             SOPHIE
      And this is Handy.  Hes the one who 
      fixed the house.

A plate crashes O.S. in the kitchen.

             HANDY
      I can fix that.

             PATRICK
        (re kitchen)
      Do I even want to know?

             GRACIE
      The rest are making dinner.

Sophie, opens the kitchen door, revealing more Smurfs working 
with chaotic precision at COOKS direction.

In a flurry of choreographed madness, the Smurfs set the table 
and lay out an amazing feast.  Suddenly, Patrick is surrounded 
by bibbed and ready-for-dinner Smurfs.

             PAPA
      Cook, youre a wonder!

       SOPHIE
Can they stay?  Please? Just 
til Papa finds them a way 
home?  Theyre not safe on 
their own.  Its okay with Mom 
if its okay with you.

SAM
Do you realize how cool this 
is?  Our very own aliens?  We 
cant just bail on em!  Mom 
said its okay with her if 
its okay with you!

             PATRICK
      You didnt say that?  Its crazy!

             SMURFETTE
      No, thats Crazy.

She points to Crazy, entertaining Reina with his NOISES.  

             GRACIE
      She hasnt cried all day.  Theyre 
      surprisingly helpful... And very well 
      mannered.

             PATRICK
      Well mannered?  We dont even know 
      what they are!  

             BRAINY
      Well, technically, sir, Smurfs are--

             PATRICK
      Im not talking to you!

             GRACIE
      They just need a place to stay for a 
      little while.

             PATRICK
      You want them to stay?

             GRACIE
      Only until Papa can... smurf a blue

She points to the baby, now gleefully wreaking havoc on 
several Smurfs in her orbit.  Patrick is not comforted.

        (leading Patrick)
      Were going to be late.

             PATRICK
      Fine... But this is not over.

He grabs a zucchini stick on his way out.  Sam takes a plate 
of food and starts out in the opposite direction.

             PAPA
      So... we wont be dining together?

             SAM

      Never do.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

INT. GAME ROOM - SAME

Sophie brings milk and cookies into the midst of playful chaos 
as the Smurfs explore the game room.

ON an AIR HOCKEY table, Smurfs whiz along, using pucks/paddles 
as hover boards, colliding madly with each other.  Smurfette 
GIGGLES as her dress billows up like Marilyn Monroes.  

ON the FOOSEBALL table, Smurfs romp amidst the wooden players 
causing them to spin wildly and kick the ball.  Hefty makes a 
dive as goalie, only to be knocked in by the ball.

             CRAZY
        (CROWD noises, then)
      Goal!  Goal!  Gooooooaaaaal!

Gutsy fiddles with a remote control.  Sams RC HELICOPTER 
takes off.  Astonished, Gutzy grabs a skid.

             GUTSY
      Grrreat Scot, Im flyiiiiiiiing!

             SOPHIE
      No, Gutsy.  Sammy wont like that!

                                             49.

Too late.  The copter SLAMS Gutsy into the wall.  He slides 
slowly down.

             GUTSY
      Im like a great blue birrrd...

Looking to reign in the madness, Sophie flips on the TV.

             SOPHIE
      Here.  You guysll like this...

Sophie selects GUITAR HERO.  As the MUSIC starts and COLORED 
DOTS whiz by, the Smurfs regard the instruments with awe.

EXT. WINSLOW CUL-DE-SAC - MOMENTS LATER

A GARDENING ENTHUSIAST, with a LEAF BLOWER/VAC, stares as the 
strange man approaches, SNIFFING the air like a hounddog. 

             GARGAMEL
      Come out, come out, little Smurfs.  I 
      promise not to hurt you... very much.

Realizing hes being watched, Gargamel SNARLS at the man.  
Unnerved, the man resumes SUCKING debris from his yard.  

INT. WINSLOW FAMILY ROOM - SAME

Brainy strikes a chord on Guitar Hero.

             BRAINY

      Like this?

Sam enters and cranks the volume.  

             SAM
      No... more like this.

             SOPHIE
      Dads not gonna like you playing his 
      sound system so loud!

             SAM
      Dads not here, is he?

He hits a chord that literally threatens to shatter the 
windows.  Brainy holds onto his ears.  The others love it.

             GUTSY
      Thats more like it, lad!

                                             50.

EXT. WINSLOW CUL-DE-SAC - SAME

The sound of ROCK MUSIC draws Gargagmels eyes up to a window, 
now silhouetted with rockin Smurfs.  He smiles and casts a 
look at the man with the leaf vacuum.

EXT. WINSLOWS ROOF - EVENING - SAME

Papa studies the stars with Sams telescope, concerned by 
their positions.  Rechecking his calculations, he grows more 
concerned, not noticing as the scope drifts down to... 

CLOSE ON: Gargamels face as he stuffs the neighbor into a 
trashcan, whacking him with the nozzle of the leaf vac.

Back to the scope, Papa GASPS, then charges the window, but 
bounces off.  Its jammed.  He eyes... the chimney.

INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME

A loud KNOCK at the door.  Sophie enters with Clumsy and 
Handy.  Leaving the security chain on, she cracks the door.

             SOPHIE

      Who is it?

Papa bounces out of the fireplace in a POOF of ash.

             PAPA
      Dont open that--

BAM!  The door is kicked open.  Sophie, Papa and Smurfs go in 
all directions as Gargamel and Azrael step in.

             GARGAMEL
      Heeeeeres Gargy!

RRRRRRrrrrrrr!  He REVS the leaf vac and sucks up Vanity.  

             GARGAMEL (CONTD)
      Deeeeeeeeeeelicious!  
        (LAUGHS, then to Azrael)
      Make it so, Number One!

Azrael GROWLS with delight and charges upstairs.  Gargamel 
vacuums up Clumsy as Sophie sits up.

             SOPHIE

      CLUMSY!

The GUITAR HERO MUSIC stops O.S. as Smurfs flee from Azrael. 
Crazy erupts in a series of ALARM noises.

                                             51.

             SMURFS
      Azrael!  Help!  Smurf for your lives!  
      Papaaaaaaaaa!

Gargamel starts vacuuming them up, CACKLING with glee.  Sam 
appears at the banister, hurling pool balls.  Gargamel 
excitedly bats them away with the nozzle.

             SAM
      Sophie!  Call 911!

             PAPA
        (ponders the vac, then)
      Hefty, Brainy, Smurfette -- see if 
      you can lure Azrael under that desk!  

             BRAINY
        (cowardly)
      Actually, Papa Smurf, dont you need 
      my leadership skills here with--

OOF!  Suddenly, Brainys shoved under the antigue desk and 
into a cast-iron ornamental vent cover by Hefty and Smurfette.

             BRAINY (CONTD)
      Why do I have to be the bait?

             SMURFETTE
      What, you think thats a job for a 
      girl?

She gives him a final push into the vent.  Suddenly... Hefty 
YELLS and gets SUCKED up by the vac.

IN THE HALL: Sophie holds the cordless PHONE in one hand and 
scoops fleeing smurfs into her doll stroller with the other.

             SOPHIE (INTO CORDLESS PHONE)
      Its not a prank, officer!  An evil 
      sorcerer-er!... Vacuuming our Smurfs!

The phone CLICKS dead.  She hurls it at Gargamel and dashes 
away, scooping more Smurfs to saftey.

SMURFETTE pokes out from under the desk and spots Azrael.

             SMURFETTE
        (faking distressed damsel)
      Oh dear!  Help!  Anybody!  Brainys 
      trapped and he cant get out!

Azrael grins and comes running as Smurfette slips away.  


THE SMURFS - Stem & Weiss - 6/16/09 
                                             52.

             BRAINY
      Aaaaaaaaaaaagh!

As Azrael paws insanely for Brainy, safe behind the vent,  
Papa races into the hall and blows Gargamel a RASPBERRY.

             PAPA
      Hey!  Smurf-hole!

Gargamel gives chase.  Papa dives under the desk.

             GARGAMEL
      Come to papa... Papa!

Gargamel shoves the vac tube under the desk.  MEOOW!  The vac 
sticks on Azraels butt, SUCKING him in.  The motor STRAINS.  
Gargamel withdraws the tube to find Azraels tail protruding.

             GARGAMEL (CONTD)
      Azrael, No!  Speak to me!  Speak to 
      me sweetkins!

As Gargamel SMACKS the tube about, Sam, Gutsy and Handy hurl 
everything theyve got at him from the bannister.  

             SAM
      Get... Out... Of my house!

             GUSTY
      We gotta shut tha thing doon!

He grabs a terrified Handy and leaps...

       GUTSY
Long live the Smurfs!

Ahhhhhhhhh!

HANDY

They land on Gargamels back as he flails around trying to 
free Azrael.  Gutsy yanks his hair, while handy studies the 
blower.  Plugged by Azrael, it WAILS with INCREASING PITCH.

Handy spots a switch... REVERSE.  CLICK!  The pressure begins 
to build.  Oblivious, Gargamel, continues whacking the tube 
while trying to get Gutsy off his head.

             HANDY
      Shes gonna blow!

Handy and Gutsy jump clear as Gargamel bangs the vac one last 
time to free Azrael... WHOOSH!  Azrael shoots out as if from a 
canon.  MEEOOOWL!  He careens off a lamp, slams into a wall 
and slides into a heap.

Gargamel is simultaneously blown back as Smurfs shoot from the 
vac like from an automatic T-shirt gun.  


THE SMURFS - Stem & Weiss - 6/16/09 
                                             53.

Smurfs land everywhere as Gargamel sails, BELLOWING, out the 
door.  Sophie SLAMS it shut.

EXT. WINSLOW CUL-DE-SAC - SAME

Gargamel lays on his back, out cold.  The Winslows door opens 
and Azrael is BOOTED into a heap beside his master as the door 
slams closed again.  

As Azrael licks Gargamels face... RING.  Vans phone.  
Puzzled Gargamel, opens it, and is startled by Odiles voice.  

             ODILE (O.S. - ON PHONE) 
      Gargamel, dahling.  Just checking in.  
      Hows it coming?

The sound of her brings him to life.  He stares coldly at the 
house as the Smurfs and children shut windows, pull shades, 
etc.  All in a vain attempt to keep him out.

             GARGAMEL
      Fear not, mlady.  Ill have the 
      ingredients for your potion any 
      minute, now. 

             ODILE (ON PHONE)
      Fabuleux!  Ill send a car for you at 
      two, tomorrow.  Mon chri, when you 
      take the GlamourCon stage and the 
      spotlights come on, youll be a star.

Suddenly the spotlights do come on and Gargamel is filled with 
anticipation as... POLICE CARS surround him.

             POLICE OFFICER (O.S. LOUDSPEAKER)
      Police!  Get you hands on your head!

             GARDENING ENTHUSIAST
        (charging in with POLICE)
      Thats him!   Hes the one who 
      attacked me!

             GARGAMEL
      You again!  On your knees!  
        (FIRES up blower)
      All of you!  On your knees or feel 
      the wrath of the great and powerful-- 

ZAPPPP!  A police taser takes him down.

INT. WINSLOW GAME ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

The kids and Smurfs watch out the window, CHEERING as the 
police drive off with Gargamel.

      SMURFETTE
Thank Smurf!

ROMEO
Thats what Im sayin.

Crazy cranks up Guitar Hero and launches into an victory song 
as the other Smurfs begin a wild dance. 

Then, the MUSIC STOPS.  The Smurfs all turn to a careworn Papa.

             PAPA
        (holding his star notes)
      Quiet, everyone!  Please!  Im afraid 
      things are not quite as smurfy as 
      they seem.

The Smurfs nervously gather around Papa. 

             PAPA (CONTD)
      Unfortunately, my little Smurfs... 
      Im afraid without my books or 
      laboratory, getting home will be a 
      smurf harder than I thought.

             BRAINY
      You mean... we cant get home?

             PAPA
      No no, of course well get home... I 
      just, um, ah, well...

             GREEDY
      What about smurfberries?  We ate most 
      of em in the chocolate box. 

A MURMER of panick ripples through the group.

             PAPA
      Calm down, my little Smurfs.  First 
      things first, we still have a few 
      Smurfberries.  

Papa pulls a pouch from his pocket.

             VARIOUS SMURFS
      But thatll never last!  Theres too 
      many of us!  I feel weak already!  I 
      I want to go home!

             CLUMSY
      Oh, boy, this is all my fault.  

             PAPA
      Now, now, Clumsy. No need for blame.

                                             55.

The others try not to glare too hard at Clumsy, but clearly 
theyre not happy with him.  Sophie picks him up into a hug.

             PAPA (CONTD)
      If we can just find an ancient 
      collection of alchemy books, I should 
      be able to Smurf us a way home.

             SOPHIE
      You mean, magic books?

             SAM
      Maybe something like... this?

As Sam quickly types at the Viao, the Smurfs gather around, 
amazed by a list of ADS for MAGIC BOOKS.

             PAPA
      Amazing.  What is this finding 
      machine?

             SAM
      Its called Google.

             SMURFS
      Ooooooh.  Gooooooogle.

             PAPA
        (re book title)
      There!  That should work!

             SAM
      Ah, One copy... Master Lis Antique 
      Magic Pagoda, Chinatown.

             PAPA
      Thats it then.  First thing in the 
      morning, Ill ask your father to lead 
      a search party to Chinese Town.  

             SAM
      Our dad?  Youre smurfin  with us, 
      right?  He doesnt have time to tie 
      his own shoes.

             SOPHIE
      Hes under so much pressure you could 
      use him as an inner tube on a bicycle.

             PAPA
      That may be, but we fathers have a 
      way of speaking to one another.  Im 
      sure when I explain our situation, 
      hell understand.

      Oookay.  Good good luck with that.

             SAM
      Yeah.  Now, lets get this place 
      cleaned up.  Cause what he wont 
      understand, is you getting our house 
      attacked by ye olde homicidal wizard.

Beat.  The Smurfs swarm the house, desperately cleaning.

EXT. WINSLOW HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

Patrick and Gracie pull into the drive.

INT HALL/SOPHIES ROOM - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

Patrick & Gracie peer in to find Sophie, Reina and Clumsy fast 
asleep, cuddled with several Smurfs in bed.  Dozens more SNORE 
peacefully, cuddled in shoe-box beds all over the room.

INT. SAMS ROOM - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

Patrick & Gracie peer in to see Sam sleeping amidst the 
clutter of his room.  Gutsy SNORES in the helicopter.

             PATRICK
      I dont see why we needed that 
      meeting.  Hes a really good kid. 

             GRACIE
      Hes a great kid.  Hes just got a 
      lot of energy and needs his father to 
      help direct it.

Off Patricks look, she lovingly caresses his cheek.

INT. WINSLOW DINING ROOM - NIGHT - A LITTLE LATER

Patrick listens to FRENCH lessons on his laptop, while 
reviewing the Paris file Odile gave him.

                             INTERCUT WITH:

INT. WINSLOW MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT - SAME

In bed, Gracie soothes baby Reina in the bassinet with one 
hand, while, browsing discount school clothes on the 
internet.  She types an IM: Going to bed now.  Love you.

DOWNSTAIRS: Patric replies: luv u 2. nite.

Disappointed, Gracie, closes her lap top and curls up in their 
huge bed, alone.

                                             57.

INT. JAIL - NY - NIGHT

Papers are stamped with a BANG.  A filthy, long-nailed thumb 
is imprinted.  In a FLASH, Gargamels dour MUG SHOT appears.  
MEOW!  A caged Azrael WAILS as he and Gargamels bag are 
checked into the property room.  A cell door SLAMS and 
Gargamel is left to rot.  He shakes the bars...  

             GARGAMEL
      You cant do this!  Im a genius!  I 
      have to get ready for GlamourCon!  
      Theyre going to worship me! Worship!

INT. WINSLOW DINING ROOM/KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT

Patrick finally closes his computer and enters the kitchen to 
put on tea.  There, Smurfs cuddle in oven mitts and pot-
holders.  Cook SNORES, clinging to a ladle.  Patrick opens a 
cupboard and Lazy tumbles out.  Patrick catches him and 
nestles him in a bowl.  Opening a drawer for a spoon, Patrick 
finds Crazy, BEAT BOXING in his sleep.

As Patrick gently closes the drawer, SILENCING the sound.  
HUSHED VOICES catch his attention.

             SMURFETTE(O.S.)
      I know its silly Papa Smurf, but 
      when I close my eyes, all I see is 
      Gargamel.  As if hes calling to me.

Patrick peers into the breakfast nook.  On a seat cushion, 
Papa tucks in Smurfette.  Brainy lies awake, nearby.

             PAPA
      There, there, my little Smurfette.  
      His power over you faded long ago.

             BRAINY
        (SHUDDERS with fear)
      Might we change the subject?  These 
      cushions, for instance.  Quite lumpy.  
      I miss my mushroom.

Vanity chimes in from a Barbie couch in a nearby DOLLHOUSE.  
His eyes now covered with a doll-sized sleep mask.  

             VANITY
      I never slept outside our village.  
      Im going to wake with worry lines.

             PAPA
      Shhh, now, now, my little Smurfs...

             PAPA (CONT'D)
      SMURF-A-BYES, CLOSE YOUR EYES, GO TO 
      SLEEP MY LITTLE BLUE BIRDS...

With SONG #3, Papa lullabies the last of his waking Smurfs to 
sleep, wishing them safely home.  During the song we cut to:

PRISON: Gargamel twists a VERSE, luring a MOTH to his cell.  
He WHISPERS to it, a la Gandalf, and sends it for help.  

BACK TO WINSLOWS KITCHEN...By SONGS END, Patrick is humbled 
by Papas tenderness with so many Smurfs.

             PATRICK
        (whispering)
      Thats quite an operation youve got 
      going there.

             PAPA
      Oh, hi, uh... Yes, I suppose it is.

             PATRICK
      You dont do that every night?

Patrick pours Papa some tea in a SHOT GLASS.

             PAPA
      Well, bedtimes always trickier away 
      from home.

             PATRICK
      Wow.  Ive only got three mouths to 
      feed and Im up to my neck.

             PAPA
      Well, it helps not to think of them 
      as mouths to feed, but as hands that 
      can help.  
        (off Patricks look)
      Smurf be told... Im a little over my 
      head myself.  In fact, might I be so 
      bold as to seek a small favour of 
      you, Master Winslow?  One Papa to 
      another?

             PATRICK

        (wary)
      Uh... Like what?

             PAPA
      Ah.  Well, theres a book of magic 
      spells in your Chinese Town I need to 
      conjure a blue moon to smurf us home.

             PATRICK
      Riiight.  Who hasnt needed that?

             PAPA
      Exactly.  So if you could arrange 
      passage for us in the morning--

             PATRICK
      Oh, wow.  Mr. Smurf, Id love to help 
      with your magical quest, but truth 
      is, Im stretched so thin right now,  
      I just cant take on even one more 
      little thing... or a hundred.

             PAPA
        (crestfallen)
      Oh, I see.

             PATRICK
      I mean, Gracie wants me home more, 
      the kids need attention, the bills 
      are piling up and now Im suppose to 
      be in Paris twice a month. 

             PAPA
        (masking disappointment)
      Right, right... of course. 

             PATRICK
      Yeah.  And the worse thing?  Gracie 
      doesnt even know about Paris yet... 
      I dont know how to tell her.  Its 
      gonna break her heart.

Papa graciously sets his own worries aside with a SIGH...

             PAPA
      Well... Theres no use keeping 
      secrets, my friend.  Youll just wind 
      up alone. 

             PATRICK
      So... You think I should just come 
      out and tell her?

             PAPA
      I often find with my little Smurfs, 
      the truth, gently coated with tender 
      care, is easier to hear.  Do 
      something meaningful for her.  Then 
      share... Then duck.

        (smiles)
      Sometimes even a Papa needs a Papa.

Patrick pauses in the doorway, struck by some deeper thought.

             PATRICK
      Right, well... Goodnight.

             PAPA
      Oh, and Master Winslow... You might 
      also take her hand, look her in the 
      eye and say, I smurf you.  Does the 
      heart good.

             PATRICK
        (beat, amused)
      Ill keep it in mind.

Patrick Exits.  Papa SIGHS, then gazing from the moon, back to 
his sleeping Smurfs, he quietly REPRISES the LULLABYE...

             PAPA
      Worry no worry.  Fret no fret. Soon, 
      Ill dream you home...
        (then, sadly)
      If only I knew how.

INT. WINSLOW BREAKFAST ROOM - AM

Sophie and Sam actually sit at breakfast as Patrick does his 
best to serve French Toast.  He pulls Sams earphones out.

             PATRICK
      Not this morning.

             SAM
      Who are you trying to impress?  Were 
      going to be late for school.

             SOPHIE
      Im full dad.  I gotta get my books.

             PATRICK
      Just wait for you mom, would ya?  I 
      have something important to tell her.

             GRACIE (O.S.)
      Sam!  Sophie!  Cmon, were gonna be--
        (enters, surprised by kids)
      Late?

             PATRICK
        (hands her tea, proudly)
      Four Winslows at the table.  Were 
      spending time together.

REVEAL Reina under the table, happily chewing on Grouchy.

             GROUCHY
      I hate spending time together.

             GRACIE
      Wow.  I could get used to this.
        (as Patrick beams)
      French Toast?  What is it with you 
      and French lately?

             PATRICK
      What?  No.  Its just-- thats all I 
      know how to make.

Suddenly, Sams helicopter WHIRLS through the kitchen, 
followed by Gutsy, chasing it with the remote control.

             SAM

      Hey!

             GRACIE
        (casually ducks copter)
      Cmon on guys, weve gotta go.

             PATRICK
        (alarmed)
      Wait, youre going in early?

             GRACIE
      Reinas got her shots so she can 
      start preschool.  Then weve got 
      Mommy and Me and were going to 
      Carols for a playdate.  Why?

             PATRICK
      Nothing.  Its just... I wanted to 
      spend some time with you so we could 
      talk because... you know...
        (looking for words)
      I smurf you?

             GRACIE
      I have no idea what that means...
        (whispers in his ear)
      But, I totally smurf you too.

             PATRICK
        (whispers back)
      Then, how about dinner, tonight? 

             GRACIE
        (dubious)
      I thought were trying to save money.

             PATRICK
      We could order in?

             GRACIE
        (a gleam in her eye)
      Or... I could drop the kids at my 
      sisters after school and someone  
      could make us a nice romantic meal... 
      Like he used to... when we were young?  

             PATRICK
        (anxiety building)
      Uhh.  Okay.  Sure.  Thats... great.

             GRACIE
        (a playful kiss)
      You should come home from Europe more 
      often... Kids, lets move it!

As his family piles out, Patrick watches them go, unnerved.

             PATRICK
      I dont have time to make dinner.  I 
      dont even remember how to make 
      dinner.

Patrick looks down to see Cook, Smurfette and the others 
looking up at him.  Without words an idea is hatched.

EXT. WINSLOW HOUSE/INT. GRACIES CAR - DAY

Gracie loads baby bags into the trunk.  Sophie climbs in back 
with her toy baby buggy and bulging BACKPACK, from which Papa, 
Hefty, Gutsy, and Clumsy peer from half-opened zippers.

             SAM
      What are you doing?

Sophie struggles to keep the Smurfs in her pack.  Like Whack-a-
Mole, ones head goes in, anothers arm, leg or butt pops out.

             SOPHIE
      Im taking them to get Papas magic 
      book, so they can get home.  

             SAM
      No way!  You cant be running around 
      New York alone.  Youre too little. 

             SOPHIE
      Im big to them.

             SAM
      Then, Im coming too.  Wait for me at 
      the subway.

             SOPHIE
      No, youre not!

             SAM

      Mom!

             SOPHIE
      Okay, okay!  Shhhh!

The front door slams as Gracie gets in.  Sam and Sophie fake 
smiles at Gracie as backs them out of the drive.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. SCHOOL - MANHATTAN - AM                

Sophie waves innocently as Gracie & Sam drive off.  Sam gives 
her a warning finger: dont you leave without me!  Sophie 
sticks out a resentful tongue as TINY, WIDE-OPEN EYES peer 
from her backpack pouches.

INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY - A LITTLE LATER

Patrick cruises down the aisle as items fly off shelves on 
both sides, filling the cart.  We catch only a glimpse of the 
tiny blue shoppers working the shelves.

EXT. JAIL - EXERCISE YARD - EARLY MORNING

GANG BANGERS do pull-ups, etc.  Gargamel, holding Azrael and 
his bag, watches the sky.  He turns to see BUBBA, a huge con 
with a phonebook-sized Sudoku book, towering over him.

             GARGAMEL
      Do you mind?  Ive summoned the giant 
      eagles to fetch me out of here and 
      youre blocking my view.

                                             64.

             BUBBA
        (re his Sudoku)
      Doh.  This box could be a six or two 
      or this box could be a six or two.

             GARGAMEL
      Look, you fat-necked circus freak, 
      Im expected at GlamourCon.  I am 
      Lady Laurents star presenter.

             BUBBA
      Excuse me while I rip your legs off.

Bubba GROWLS and CRACKS his knuckles.  Just then, the moth 
returns leading... AN EPIC SWARM of FLIES.

             GARGAMEL
      No no!  I said, eagles not flies.

Gargamel is blackened entirely by flies and lifted slowly off 
the ground, holding Azrael and his bag.

             GARGAMEL (CONTD)
        (spitting out flies)
      Oh, very well... Up!  Up, you 
      inglorious devils!

Laboring under Gargamels weight, the flies smash him into the 
top of a chin-up bars upright pole, groin-first.

             GARGAMEL (CONTD)
        (pained falcetto)
      Owwwwww!  Im coming, mlady!  

He WAILS in pain as the flies drag him, ass-first, through the 
barbed-wire fence top and away.

INT. CHINESE BOOKSTORE - DAY

Rays of sun pierce the dusty dimness as the door creaks open.

             SAM

      Hello?

Sophie and Sam wander through silk kites, jars of dried herbs 
and a life-like display of an OLD CHINESE MAN in Ray-Bans, 
sitting for ceremonial tea.

             SAM (CONTD)
        (unzipping the Smurfs)
      Alright, find your book... But Im 
      watching you.

Papa and the others scramble from the backpacks.

      Thank you, Sam.  Smurf out, everyone.

Suddenly, the Chinese Man mannequin grabs Sams arm.

             CHINESE MAN
      Ahhh, little blue folk, you bring.

The kids freeze.

             CHINESE MAN (CONTD)
      No worries.  Stranger things I have 
      seen.  What is it you seek?

             PAPA (O.S.)
      Heavens to Smurfatroid!  Its here!

The old man shuffles to join the others at the back of the 
store, where Papa holds a book among stacks of ancient texts. 

             CHINESE MAN
      Ah, many have sought to the secrets 
      of this volume.  But none could pay 
      the price.  Read it, you can?

CLOSE ON BOOK: A dusty original, What Do Smurfs Do All Day?  
A familiar symbol glitters beneath the title... PEYO.  Papa 
turns the book over and struggles to read... Backwards.

             PAPA
      E smurfineus rei magnificum 
      flibertygibbet Ahnk...

The book begins to GLOW as various spells, illustrated by 
ENGRAVINGS, COME TO LIFE. 

             SMURFS 

      Ooooh.

             PAPA
      Lets see... Lightening Strikes, 
      Tornado, Hail... Ah, here we are... 
      Moon. Blood Red, Eclipse... Blue.

ANGLE ON the HOLOGRAPHIC pop up book.  A BLUE MOON crests 
over FOG as a shimmering PORTAL, like at the Forbidden Grotto, 
rises up from a misty POND.  The Smurfs are awed. 

             PAPA (CONTD)
      What is the cost of this book?

             CHINESE MAN
      For you?  One day only... Twenty 
      thousand.  Cash.

Papa Gulps.  The Smurfs Gulp.  Sophie looks to Sam.

             SAM
      Ive got eleven dollars.

             PAPA
      Might we please just copy this spell?

             CHINESE MAN
        (annoyed)
      Fine... that would be.

As he thrusts out a hand for Sams cash, Papa hurriedly 
scribbles from the book.

             PAPA
      In the full moons glow, stir in 
      slowly, the feather of a bird that 
      does not fly.  Finely ground powder  
      of a unicorns horn... Hair of a...

Gargamel DROPS FROM THE SKY.  Azrael SPLASHES down beside him.  
Plucking off a few SNAPPING TURTLES, they charge back into 
Belvedere.

INT. KITCHEN/DINING ROOM - DAY - A LITTLE LATER

Cook works up a smurfy mess in the kitchen as Romeo directs 
Tailor and a few others in a pandemonium of preparations.  
Patrick tastes a simple familiar treat of his own...

      Huh... I may survive this yet. 
      Gracies going to love these.

      when we were in college.

      Hello?

INT. THE GANSEVOORT - HOTEL - SAME

Van hustles through the uber-trendy lobby, talking on an 
outdated rent-a-phone.  GlamourCon will soon be in full swing.

The line goes dead.  Patrick slumps.  

             SMURFETTE
      Mr. Winslow, are you okay?

             PATRICK
      All she wanted was a simple romantic 
      dinner.  Ill be lucky if Im back in 
      time to make Fruit Loops... Je suis 
      mort quand je lui dis de Paris.

         I tell her of Paris.)
      Wheres Papa?

The Smurfs nervous looks only add to Patrick alarm.

INT. CENTRAL PARK ZOO - PENGUIN EXHIBIT - DAY

Sophie, Clumsy and Sam gape, slack-jawed, into the tank.

             SOPHIE
        (covers her/Clumsys eyes)
      We shouldnt be exposed to such 
      violence.

Gutsy flees with a FEATHER and the now tattered, soggy, list.

INT. BELVADERE CASTLE - DAY

Gargamel kicks the holy crap out of his lab gear, desperately 
trying to squeeze from it some last residue of potion.

             GARGAMEL
      Cmon, blast you!  I know theres a 
      drop in there somewhere!

He pounds the table so hard that Azrael is bounced up into the 
rafters where he clings upsidedown, WAILING.

INT. MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY - DAY

Sophie and Sam keep watch as Gutsy and Hefty file the horn 
from the skeleton of a prehistoric RHINO. 

             SOPHIE
      He doesnt look like a unicorn.

             PAPA
      Well, technically, any one-horned 
      beast in a storm.

The head CRASHES to the floor.  Hefty pops out from behind it.

             HEFTY
      Uh... I could put that back on.

The kids toss the Smurfs into Sophies buggy and flee.

                                 WIPE TO:

INT. GOLDS GYM - DAY

The kids get odd looks as Sophie pushes her stroller 
nonchalantly through a forest of hulking body builders.

             SOPHIE
        (squinting at fading list)
      Hair of a giant.  These guys count?

Suddenly PATRICK EWING is towering over them.  The kids and 
Smurfs watch, amazed, as he crosses to a bench press. 

Instantly, Hefty and Gutsy slink down from the stroller and 
stealthily head for Mr. Ewing with a small SCISSORS.  Over 
dumbbells, through slamming machinery, they get to the bench.  

Straining under the weight, Mr. Ewings eyes go wide as, SNIP.

                                 SLAM TO:

EXT. GOLDS GYM - SECONDS LATER

Sophie and Sam sprint away with the Smurf-buggy.  Patrick 
Ewing leans from the door, missing a swath of hair.

             PATRICK EWING
      Next time just ask for an autograph!

Sophie and Sam race across the street.  As they do, a car 
SCREECHES to a stop, inches from them.   Its... Dad.

      off with my kids?

      Thats not the point.

      If you needed a book so badly, why 
      didnt you just say so?

      Oh, I see, the truths not so easy

      No!  Thats what I mean.  Smurfity-

The mortified Smurfs cover their ears in shock.

             PAPA
      Mr. Winslow.  The children.

             PATRICK
      Get in the car.  All of you.

      And you, back to the house for the 
      rest of your little blue horde, then 
      I want you all back to mushroom town 
      or wherever it is you came from.

Patrick holds the car door open.  Papa doesnt budge.

             PAPA
      You have every right to be angry, but 
      we cant go home until we finish 
      collecting our ingredients, then 
      recopy our spell at Master Lis.

Patrick gazes helplessly into the pleading eyes of his kids...

      Fine.  Ill pick them up at the 
      bookstore after work.

Patricks unsure whether to be annoyed or touched as Sophie 
hugs Clumsy, then reluctantly gets in the car.  Its a painful 
goodbye as the car pulls away, leaving the Smurfs behind.

INT. BELVEDERE CASTLE - DAY

Having all but destroyed his lab, Gargamel desperately stares 
with a candle into his last piece of tubing.

             GARGAMEL
      Blast it!  I command you, come out!

Suddenly great bolt of blue energy shoots from the tubing, 
blowing a hole through the back wall.  Gargamel stares at the 
tube, amazed, then lovingly coaxes a few last drops of residue 
into his vial.  He smiles at an amazed Azrael...

             GARGAMEL (CONTD)
      You dont suppose that will come in 
      handy, do you?

They toss back their heads in a hearty PIRATE LAUGH.

      Actually... none of us really knows.

As Romeo ponders this truth, Gracie enters and is amazed.

GRACIES POV: The house has been transformed -- candles give 
the perfect lighting, rose petals drop from above.

             GRACIE
      Wow... Patrick?  Honey?

INT. KITCHEN - SAME

Gracie enters to find, not Patrick, but Cook and his team.

             GRACIE
      Wheres Patrick?

             COOK
        (bad at lying)
      Uh... hiding?

Unfortunately, all the Smurfs are bad at lying...

             BRAINY
      Yes!  Exactly.  You can come out now, 
      Mr. Winslow.  
        (to Gracie)
      Surprise!

             SMURFS
      Yes!  Yes!  Surpriiiiiise!  

             SMURFETTE
        (after a long silence)
      Um, actually he just stepped out for 
      a minute to um... Pick you flowers.

             SMURFS
      Yes!  Thats it!  Flowers!  
      Beautiful, smurfy, romantic flowers!  

Gracie stares them all down.

             COOK
        (lamely)
      He made all this.  Im just stirring.

             SMURFETTE
        (breaking down)
      Aw, its no good!  Im sorry, Mrs. 
      Winslow.  He had to go to work and we 
      just couldnt bear to see you sad.

Gracies eyes water up.

             ROMEO
      But he insists the lady enjoy a 
      smurfy merlot while she waits.

Romeo holds a glass.  Gracie grabs the bottle and exits, 
leaving the Smurfs miserable.

             COOK
      That went well, eh?

INT. THE GANSEVOORT - HOTEL - LATE AFTERNOON - SAME

GLITTERATI mingle to house music mix.  A FANFARE and SPOTLIGHT 
bring us to Odile, striding down a runway. 

             ODILE
      Ladies and Gentleman, and now the 
      moment youve all been waiting for... 
      Laurent International presents...
      Monsieur Gargamel.

A curtain swooshes open.  Gargamel and Azrael blink into the 
SPOTLIGHT as two STUNNING MODELS slip a new Armani HAIR ROBES 
onto each of them, like a rock stars.  

Odile takes Gargamels hand and the three of them stride the 
runway to the MUSIC.  Pausing at WOMAN VOLUNTEER (50s), they 
pull her up to the runway.  Gargamel theatrically opens his 
vial and pours a drop of potion onto her head.  

In SHIMMER OF MAGIC, the woman TRANSFORMS into a gorgeous, 25 
year-old version of herself.  Her image fills the BIG SCREENS.

             ODILE (CONTD)
      Mes amis!  The Rasputin of the Beauty 
      Rvolution!...

The the crowd goes INSANE.   As much as Gargamel was mocked in 
the opening... Now, he is adored.  

             GARGAMEL
        (to Azrael)
      Ha!  Tony Robbins-Hood can kiss my 
      big hairy Azrael!  Eh, kitty?  Ha!

As they LAUGH, Azrael and Gargamel are swept onto the dance 
floor and launch into a manic, medieval ROMP.  The crowd joins 
in for... A Slumdog, JAI HO-like dance extravaganza.

EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - EVENING

 

A few TOURISTS stroll the sidewalk, oblivious to the over-
turned dog food box, paper bag, and jumbo take-out carton 
stumbling along, powered by little blue feet. 

A ROTTWEILER on a leash, BARKS, startling the Smurfs.  They 
tumble down the stairs of a lower level apartment.  

IN THE STAIRWELL: Papa, Gutsy, Hefty and Clumsy shake off 
their disguises.  Papa wrestles with the unwieldy map. 

             HEFTY
      Are we almost there?  Im starving.

             GUTSY
      Yurrr noot the only one weak in the 
      knees.

He indicates Clumsy, who begins to COUGH.  Hes very pale.

             PAPA
      Clumsy, are you alright?

             CLUMSY
        (clearly not)
      Ib fime.  Lets kleep Smurfin.

             PAPA
      Maybe we should have our Smurfberry 
      rations.  Its been too long.

The Smurfs reach into Papas pouch and savor their portion.

             CLUMSY
        (overstating)
      Mmmm, burfsmerries... Buch metter.

             PAPA
        (re the pouch)
      Thats odd.  Theres extra. 

In their hunger, Hefty and Gutsy gobble the last few. 

             PAPA (CONTD)
      Either I packed too many... or 
      someones not taking their rations.
        (off their blinking eyes)
      Show me your hands.

The Smurfs open their hands.  Each is stained with berry 
juice... except Clumsy.

        (stunned)
      Oh, Clumsy... you havent been taking 
      your Smurfberries, have you?

Ashamed, frightened, Clumsy shakes his head, No.

             PAPA (CONTD)
      No wonder youre so pale!

             CLUMSY
      Im sorry, Papa.  This whole things 
      my fault, so I just had to be sure 
      youd all make it home.  

             HEFTY
        (eyes watering up)
      So... youve been giving us your 
      share? 

             PAPA
      Alright, theres no time to lose.  We 
      have to get that spell and get Clumsy 
      home to our village tonight or hes 
      Smurfed.  
        (re empty berry pouch)
      And the rest of us arent far 
      behind...

                              DISSOLVE TO:

INT. WINSLOW HOUSE - MEDIA ROOM - EVENING

Gracie, channel surfs in search of... anything.  Her phone 
BUZZES.  Its Patrick.  She hits IGNORE and tosses it onto a 
side table, knocking over an old Diet Coke. 

Annoyed, Gracie gets up to blot the spill, but as she does, 
uncovers the PARIS FILE.  The airline ticket sleeve is 
unmistakable... as is her look of broken-hearted betrayal.

INT. GLAMOURCON - THE GANSEVOORT - HOTEL - EVENING

Champagne flows.  Gargamel holds court with a bevy of stunning 
MODELS.  All are fit with custom Armani HAIR ROBES. 

      MODEL #1
Oh, do me next!  I want some!  

MODEL #2
Please, Gargie!  Me too!  

             GARGAMEL
      Now, ladies, lets not beg.  On 
      second thought, do beg.

                                             76.

GARGAMEL basks in the crowds approval, near tears.  Hes 
popular, hes beloved, hes a god.  Odile pulls close.

             ODILE
      Well, it looks like you and I are 
      going to rule the world.  

             GARGAMEL
      My mother would be so proud... If I 
      had one.

             ODILE
        (fondling his vile)
      All we need now are truckloads of 
      this stuff.

             GARGAMEL
        (nervously)
      Oh.  Right.  Actually... I believe 
      you can help me with that.

INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING 

Gathered upon the table, the Smurfs dine on the feast meant 
for Patrick and Gracie.

             SMURFETTE
      Poor Mrs. W.  I never dreamed a man 
      could be gone this long.

             BRAINY
      Well, lucky for us, Im sure Papa 
      will be back soon.

             HANDY
        (toasting)
      To Papa!

             GROUCHY
      To going home!

             SMURFS
      To going home!

Spirits back up, the Smurfs dig in.  Its a rich family scene, 
especially for Gracie, who watches for a beat, unnoticed in 
the archway as the guys jostle to serve Smurfette.

             VARIOUS SMURFS
        (comically polite)
      Please pass the greens... Allow me, 
      Smurfette.  No, allow me, Smurfette.   
      No, allow me... Peas, please.  Your 
      hearts of palm?  Smurflicious!

      Oh, Mrs. W.  Wont you join us?

             ROMEO

      minute.

             GRACIE

      Im sure.

INT. LAURENT CORPORATE OFFICES - NIGHT

Finishing up work, Patrick pulls on his jacket.

             PATRICK (INTO PHONE)
      Gracie, good news, Ill be home in 
      twenty.  And Ill make all this up to 
      you.  Promise.

A BUZZ on his INTERCOM.

             ODILE 
      Patrick, Dahling, my office, S'il 
      vous plat?   

Patrick SIGHS at yet one more thing...   

INT. ODILES OFFICE - NIGHT

Patrick enters to find Odile seated behind her elegant desk.

             ODILE
      Darling, this this is Monsieur 
      Gargamel.  He believes you have 
      something of his.

Gargamel sprawls on the couch, playing with Vans phone.

             GARGAMEL
      Charmed, Im sure.

Gargamel smiles his least sleazy smile, and SNAPS Patricks 
picture as Azreal PURRS, rubbing against Patricks leg. 

                              DISSOLVE TO:

INT. WINSLOW DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Wining, dining, Gracie and Smurfs.  Laughing, tipsy, but... 
for the first time all day, Gracie is at peace.  Farmer offers 
a slice of BLUE TOMATO.  Gracie savors it.

      Mmmm, Farmer.  Whatd you call this?

             FARMER
      Fried blue tomatoes.

             GRACIE
      I cant believe you guys do this 
      every night.

             SMURFETTE
      We cant believe you dont.

             BRAINY
      Yes, but they do have Google.

Gracie smiles.  Her table is brimming with warmth as Smurfs 
share bread, CLINKING glasses and LAUGHTER. 

             GRACIE
      You guys have no idea how special 
      what you have is... 

Gracie sips her wine, tinged with warmth and sadness. 

             PATRICK (O.S.)

      I do...

Gracie and the Smurfs look up to see Patrick.  Gracie gets up 
and takes her plate to the sink, her back to Patrick. 

             PATRICK (CONTD)
      Gracie... Im so sorry.

             GRACIE
      About dinner?... Or Paris?

She reveals his Paris file on the counter.  Sensing the 
tension, the Smurfs quietly slip away.

             PATRICK
      Gracie... we need this promotion.  
      Im barely keeping our heads above 
      water as it is.

             GRACIE
      And you think being away from us even 
      more is the answer?

             PATRICK
      No!  But what are we going to do, 
      Gracie?  Fix the kids teeth 
      ourselves?  Sell the dog?  Maybe go 
      live in a mushroom?

      Patrick, if money is the problem, 
      tell me.  We can cut back.
        (re their lifestyle)
      Is all this really worth it?

             PATRICK
      Riiight.  Sure.  These little blue 
      guys have taken over your brain, 
      havent they?  

             GRACIE
        (beat, stung)
      Did you hear me?  Did you hear a word 
      I said?  

They stop as the kids come in, but the tension is obvious.

             SAM
      Uh... were home.

             GRACIE
        (hugs Sophie)
      Hi, guys.

      Wheres Papa and the others?

             PATRICK
      Oh, actually, thats one good thing.  
      I met their owner.  Hes picking up 
      Papa and I said Id bring the rest by 
      tomorrow.

             SOPHIE
      What?  You promised youd get em.

             SAMMY

      This owner, didnt have a huge, nasty-
      looking cat, did he?

             SAM
        (urgently)
      Mom, you gotta take us to China Town. 
      Papas in trouble, weve got to move!

The kids pull her toward the door.

             GRACIE
      What are talking about?  Whats going 
      on?

             SAM
      Ill explain on the way. 

             SOPHIE
      You promised, Daddy!  I told you it 
      was important.  I thought you were 
      listening.  

             PATRICK
      I was.  I just-- 

             SAM
      Ill get the keys!

Sophie scurries after Sam.  Upset by her distraught kids, 
Gracie turns to Patric. 

             GRACIE
      What did you do?

             PATRICK
      I... I dont know.

As Gracie starts for the door...

             BRAINY (O.S.)
      He did what?

The Smurfs burst into tears O.S. with Sophie.  Gracie freezes, 
then turns back to Patrick.

             GRACIE
      You know what?  Maybe you should just 
      take Paris.  Youre already so far 
      away... Whats the difference?

She hurries after her kids.  Patrick stares after, pained.

                                  CUT TO:

INT. CHINESE BOOK STORE - NIGHT - A LITTLE LATER

Gathered around the open book, the Smurfs listen as Papa 
WHISPERS the spell to Hefty, who copies it like a scribe.  The 
old Chinese man is asleep in the B.G. 

             PAPA
      ...then mix the ingredients and 
      smurf the holy words.  You got the 
      holy words, right?  

             HEFTY
        (as he writes)
      Good as done.

PLOP!  Clumsy passes out face down on the writing, then pops 
back up, acting in vain as if nothing happened. 

             CLUMSY
        (delirious)
      Im goob!  Better felt never!

             PAPA
      Good Lord, hes getting worse.

Headlights FLASH in the window as a car pulls up outside.

             HEFTY
      Thank Smurf!  Theres Mr. Patrick.

The door CREAKS open and in steps... Gargamel.

             GARGAMEL
      Hello, old friends.

As the Smurfs back away in dread, Gargamel delights in a 
display of CHINESE BLADES.  The Chinese starts from his sleep.

             CHINESE MAN
      W-who are you? 

             GARGAMEL
        (ignoring him)
      Ooooo, enter the dragon...

Gargamel grabs a dragon-handled, ivory letter-opener.

             GARGAMEL (CONTD)
      Poor little lizard, looks thirsty.

He pours a DROP OF ESSENCE into the dragons mouth.

             CHINESE MAN
      Look, can I help you?

             GARGAMEL
        (invoking a spell)
      GOLD, THEN BEAUTY, FIRST QUENCHED OUR 
      DESIRE / NOW WHAT WE CRAVE IS PURE 
      DRAGON FIRE!  

The handles dragon eyes GLOW RED.  BLUE ENERGY spits from the 
mouth, engulfing the sheath in CRACKLING electrical magic.

             CHINESE MAN
      Alright, Im calling the--

ZZZAM!  Gargamel unleashes a bolt of BLUE ENERGY from his new 
magic scepter.  The Smurfs SCREAM as Chinese man is FROZEN 
in a web of CRACKLING blue energy.

             PAPA

      Run!  

The Smurfs flee through a beaded curtain into the back room.  
Bringing up the rear, Papa pauses in archway to fend off 
Azrael just as...

Gargamel LAUGHS and fires another MAGIC BOLT from his scepter.  
Papa grabs a souvenir mirror and, bracing himself, deflects 
the energy away from his Smurfs, bouncing it wildly around the 
store.  Books and shelves fly.  Azrael YOWLS for cover.

             GARGAMEL
        (dodges an energy bolt)
      Oh, do struggle Papa Smurf!  You only 
      make the hunt more savory.

             PAPA
      Yeah?  Savor this!

Papa strains to aim the mirror at the display of ceremonial 
swords.  A bolt of the magic energy sends them flying... 
THWACK!  THWACK!  THWACK!  They stick in the floor around 
Gargamel, pinning him via his robe to the ground.

             GARGAMEL
        (furious, re robe)
      You fool!  Its Armani!

With Gargamel delayed, Papa dashes after the others.

INT. BOOK STORE - BACK ROOM - NIGHT

Heftys pulled the grate off of a small drainage pipe in the 
far corner.  Gutsys climbs in as Hefty pushes on him.

             CLUMSY
      Smapa Purf!  Come on!  Hurryupyit!

Papa arrives at the hole, mortified by the slow going.  He 
looks back toward the doorway.  

IN THE FRONT ROOM: Gargamel CURSES as Azrael helps him RIP his 
beloved robe free, sword by sword.

             GARGAMEL
      Damn you Azrael!  Be careful!  Tear 
      on the seam!  On the seam!

IN THE BACK ROOM:

             PAPA
      Hurry Gutsy!  Hes almost free!

             GUTSY
      Im hurrryin as fast as I can!

RIIIIIP!  Gargamel has one last sword to go.

             GARGAMEL
        (taunting)
      Oh Smurfies.... Im cooooooooming!

Gutsy breaks WIND and disappears down the pipe. Hefty squeezes 
in next, but hes even bigger.  Papa makes a decision...

             PAPA
        (giving Hefty the bag)
      Ill hold him off.  Hefty.  Take the 
      spell!  Tell Brainy he must use it to 
      get you all home!

Papa, no!

             PAPA
        (bracing with mirror)

Hefty and Clumsy watch through tears as Papa struggles to hold 
off the magic bolt from Gargamels scepter.

             HEFTY
      Find a way, Papa... Find a way!

Reaching for Papa, Clumsy is yanked into the pipe by Hefty.

             CLUMSY
      Nooooooo!  Papaaaaaa!

Left alone with Gargamel, Papa holds the mirror against the 
scepters beam as long as he can but finally...

             GARGAMEL
      Face it Papa... Youre smurfed.

A final massive bolt of blue magic freezes Papa in an agonized 
pose.  Gargamel pulls out his new camera/phone.

             GARGAMEL (CONTD)
      Hold that thought!  I want this 
      moment to last forever.

Gargamel and Azrael pose their grinning mugs on either side of 
Papa as Gargamel point the camera at themselves.  CLICK...

EXT. TRIBECA - STORM DRAIN - NIGHT

The FULL MOON lights the Murky water pouring into a storm 
drain.  KERPLOSH!  Three GASPING Smurfs flop out.  Hefty pulls 
Clumsy to shore as they catch their breath.

                                WHITE OUT.

             GUTSY
      This is Bullsmurrrf!  Were not 
      serrriously leavin Papa behind? 

             HEFTY
      Gutsy, we have no choice!  Hell find 
      a way home.  He always does.  Weve 
      got to get back to the others, while 
      the moons still full.

Looking around, Hefty eyes narrow on...

SMURFS POV, a flock of unsuspecting SEAGULLS SNORES nearby.

                                 WIPE TO:

                                             85.

EXT. STORM DRAIN - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER

CLOSE ON: a large SNORING SEAGULL.  A MUZZLE of reeds and 
twine slips gingerly over his beak.  Suddenly, Gutsy leaps 
aboard and cinches the reins around the gulls neck.

The Gull SQUAWKS and rears back, but Gutsy holds tight.

             GUTSY
      Atta girrrl!  Shoo us watcha got!

As the bird spins like a bronco, Gutsy rides with glee.  
Behind him, Hefty, YELPS, desperately clinging to the jerking 
reins of a bigger MEANER BIRD.

             GUTSY (CONTD)
      Ats it, Heft!  Shooem oos boss!

             HEFTY
      I am!  Just lettin him warm up to 
      the idea.

Gutsy and Clumsy wince as Hefty is jerked about like a yo-yo, 
until... He finally DECKS the bird with a stiff left hook.  
Immediately the other birds step in line.

INT. BELVEDERE CASTLE - NIGHT

A door CREAKS.  Footsteps CLOMP.  MEOW... Gargamel returns.

             GARGAMEL
        (HUMS, lighting candles)
      Oh, Ill roast a few, and broast a 
      few, and turn the rest to gold...

Gargamel uncovers a cage.  Inside, Papa is SUSPENDED in 
CRACKLING ENERGY, still frozen in the same terrified pose.  
Gargamel slaps him into a doll high-chair and tapes him down.

Coming to, Papa MOANS as Gargamel finishes with the tape gun.

             GARGAMEL (CONTD)
      Ah, Papa Smurf.  Amazing world, eh?  
        (re tape gun)
      Full of my kind of wonders.

Papa regards the tape gun wearily.

             GARGAMEL (CONTD)
      Yesss.  And if a few bits of Smurf 
      hair yields a vial of your essence,
        (dangling vial)
      ...Imagine what Ill harvest from a 
      hundred Smurfs!

                                             86.

Gargamel pours the last of the essense into his Dragon Scepter 
and takes aim on the dungeon... WAZAAM!  Wicker chairs become 
mushroom-shaped smurf cages.  Street barricades morph into 
smurf-sized cattle chutes.  

In moments, Belevadere is transformed into a Frankenstein-like 
essence factory.  Huge wooden cogs and gears move conveyers 
of vials past old-fashioned, Smurf-sized, sweatboxes and 
exercise machinery, which sprout essence collecting tubes.

             GARGAMEL (CONTD)
      Say hello to your new home, Papa.  
      Its where youll all be living the 
      rest of your days.  And nights.  But 
      enough small talk... Ive got orders 
      to fill.  

Ecstatic, Gargamel, raises a Sweeny Todd razor over Papas 
head.  Papas eyes go wide as.. SPLOOSH!  Gargamel hits Papa 
with a facefull of shaving cream.

             GARGAMEL (CONTD)
        (trashing the Smurf song)
      La la la-la-la-laa, la la la la la.

Papa SPITS out cream as Gargamel gleefully begins wiping his 
shavings into a thimble.

INT. WINSLOW HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

A suitcase on the bed.  Patrick neatly packs, the phone 
cradled between his shoulder and ear.

             PATRICK
      Look, hes a resourceful guy, maybe 
      they got out a window or something.

EXT. CHINESE BOOKSTORE - NIGHT

Gracie stands at the door as Sam and Sophie search the rubble.  
Still hurting, shes cool, reluctantly making this call.

                             INTERCUT WITH:

             GRACIE (ON PHONE)
      I dont know, we were hoping theyd 
      somehow made it back to you.  Were 
      going to try and retrace their steps. 

             PATRICK
      Good, good. Thats, uh... smart plan.

An awkward silence falls between them.

                                             87.

             PATRICK (CONTD)
      Listen... Gracie, about Paris.  Im 
      sure once we get used into the 
      schedule--

             GRACIE
      I need to go.  The kids are pretty 
      upset.

The phone goes dead.  Patrick stares a beat, then sets it 
aside with a SIGH and resumes packing.  

REVEAL a Smurfette watching sadly from the doorway.  She 
turns, shaking her head no to Vanity, further down the hall.  
Vanity signals to Handy, Handy to Grouchy and so on, until...

INT. WINSLOW GAME ROOM - CONTINUOUS

A somber group of Smurfs are gathered.  Farmer enters, shaking 
his head.  The group bursts into TEARS.

INT. WINSLOW HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - SAME

Patrick tries to ignore the O.S. TEARS as he packs.  He cant.

INT. WINSLOW GAME ROOM - SAME

Brainy, Smurfette and a few others, try to comfort the rest of 
the Smurfs.  Patrick enters. 

             PATRICK
      Cmon, guys, Im sure well find em. 
        (off their glares)
      Look, Im really sorry, alright?  I 
      didnt know who that guy was.  I did 
      the best I could.  So, dont look at 
      me with those big, sad--

WAAAA! They break into more inconsolable, comic tears.  
Smurfette leads Patrick away from the bunch and hops up on a 
table to speak with him. 

             SMURFETTE
      They dont blame you.  Theyre just 
      scared.  They miss their Papa.  
      Remember how it felt when you were 
      little and your papa would leave?

             PATRICK

        (beat)
      Actually, no.  My dad passed away 
      before I really knew him.

             SMURFETTE
      Oh. Gosh  No Papa?... You poor thing. 

             PATRICK
      No, its not like that... its fine.  
        (beat, off her puzzlement)
      Okay, so it was a little hard... My 
      mom had to work two jobs to keep food 
      on the table, and I barely saw her.  
      But, you know, you adjust. You get by.

Smurfette gazes up, aching for him, her big eyes moistening.  
Patrick pauses, his own bullshit failing to comfort even him.

He glances away... to the mantle... A FAMILY PORTRAIT of him, 
Gracie and the kids in happier, more carefree times.  In the 
PARK, barefoot, Patrick spins Sam in the air, while his new 
daughter giggles in her mothers arms.

             PATRICK (CONTD)
      What am I doing?  Whats wrong with 
      me?  Im about to throw everything 
      that matters to me away... and for 
      what?

             SMURFETTE
      Youre scared.

             PATRICK
      Im terrified.  Its like I have to 
      keep running faster and faster just 
      to keep up.  And if I ever stop... I 
      dont know... Well end up living in 
      a box somewhere.

             SMURFETTE

        (beat)
      Well... we live in mushrooms.  And 
      because we have each other... its 
      really nice.

Patrick smiles, warming to the notion of maybe letting go... 
just a little.  Suddenly... 

WHAM!  A SEAGULL smashes into the window behind him.  Another 
huge GULL SMASHES through the glass.  Pulling ivy vine reins, 
Hefty forces his bird into an emergency landing on the table.  
Clumsy clings to his neck.

             CLUMSY
      And keep your theat belts fasthened 
      until we thum to a compleep... thlop.

             SOPHIE

      Clumsy!

Sophie scoops Clumsy into her arms.  He smiles weakly as Gutsy 
wrangles his bird into the room.

             SMURFETTE
      Smurfy wing-work, boys, but wheres 
      Papa?

             GUTSY
      Captured by that wretched wizard!
        (giving a sack to Brainy)
      He said to give ya this, lad.

             HEFTY
      Its everything you need to conjure 
      the Blue Moon and get us home.  

             BRAINY
      Us?  What about Papa?

             JOKEY
      He said hed find a way.  Til then... 
      its up to you.

Stunned silence.

      Brainys in charge?!  Well never get 
      home!  Smurfed, I tell you, were 
      Smurfed!   Papaaaaaaaaa!

Amidst the panic, Gutsy confronts their new leader.

             GUTSY
      Its what ye always wanted, idnt it, 
      lad?  Drrreamed of, day and night?  
      Question is, now that its ere... 
      arrre ya Smurrrf enough?

Brainy GULPS, then tries to speak over the chaos.

             BRAINY
      Excuse me... Hello?

Patrick grabs Crazy and squeezes him, causing a shrill FOG 
HORN, then an AH-UUUGAH, followed by a submarine DIVE BELL.

      Guys!  Come on, a little respect.

Dozens of blinking frightful eyes turn to Brainy.

             BRAINY
      Its true... I always wanted to be in 
      charge... of, you know, a festival or 
      what color we paint the barn... but 
      not like this.  

Brainy peers into the bag with the Blue Moon spell.  

             BRAINY (CONTD)
      Mr. Winslow, seeing as were one smurf 
      short of a papa, we could sure use 
      your help.

             PATRICK
      I... I dont know anything about blue 
      moons or how to make a spell.

             BRAINY
      I dont mean that.  Im talking about 
      going after our Papa.

Amazed looks from the others.

             FRIGHTENED SMURF
      But... Papa said to get us home. 

             BRAINY
      Papa says.  Papa always says 
      something.  But, Im in charge now. 
      And I say... No Smurf left behind!

             HEFTY

        (beat)
      Brainy, Gargamels got a magic 
      scepter, now.  It spits blue fire and 
      makes him more powerful than ever.

             GUTSY
      An we doon even knooow where he is.  
      Wed need a bloodhound to find em.  
      A rrreal blue blood.

All eyes turn to Tarzan.  He looks confused, then, sniffs his 
own rear, runs in circles after his tail and falls over.  
Nope.  The Smurfs slump in despair.

      Weve got bluetooth.  My boss gave

Patrick crosses to the computer and sets to work.

      Gooooogle.

      No.  Google Earth.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT

In a nearly abandoned area of Central Park, Gracie stands 
outside the car with the kids, cradling a cup of coffee. 

             SAM
      Are you sure this is where he said 
      meet him?

             SOPHIE
      Yeah, he just said be here and be 
      ready for anything.

             SAM
      He probably just wants to say goodbye 
      before he heads to the airport. 

Just then, Patrick comes into view, in a heroes entrance with 
several dozen Smurfs, crossing a nearby foodbridge.  Theyre 
geared for battle.  Patrick carries Sams helicopter.

             GRACIE
      I thought you had a plane to catch.

             PATRICK
      My kids want to go to the park.  We 
      go to the park.  Oh, and, by the way, 
      I found Papa.  We just have to get 
      him out.  I mean, you know, if you

Gracie and the kids smile and embrace him excitedly as we...

In a thicket on the west bank, Sophie stirs boiling water on a 
camp stove while Hefty preps the spell ingredients.

A SOUVENIR KIOSK has been broken into.  We hear helium 
balloons being inflated.  One floats away... the kind with an 
inflatable teddy bear inside. 

Sam steps out and holds a finger to check the wind.

             BRAINY (V.O.)
      Repeat, Air Command!  We are go!

He releases handfuls of ribbon...

BRAINY and GRACIES POV (THROUGH SPYGLASSES): to Wagners Ride 
of the Valkyries, dozens of large HELIUM BALLOONS rise into 
the air, bearing smurfs inside, each holding a PIN. 

ON THE GROUND: Several straggling Smurfs wrestle comically to 
get themselves into their balloons for inflating by Sam.   

IN THE AIRBORNE BALLOONS: Smurfs run furiously, to 
spin/guide the balloons toward Belvedere.  They are AMAZED by 
the view as they float over the park.

ANGLE ON: wee-hour NEW YORKERS enjoy the runaway balloons.

Spotted, the ballooning Smurfs stop running, leaving the 
humans clueless that the flying teddy bears are alive.  Once 
out of view, they immediately start steering again.

At the kiosk, SAM finishes strapping the R/C copter to Gutsys 
back and the remote to his chest.

Gutsy pulls down a pair of doll goggles, nods and LIFTS OFF.

INT. BELVEDERE CASTLE - NIGHT

Gargamel and Azrael dance around the essence factory in 
macabre glee as the glop of Papas beard gurgles through in an 
ominous test of whats to come for the Smurfs.

Gargamel holds the dragon handle of his scepter to the spigot, 
filling its mouth with smurf-blue ESSENCE.  The eyes glow 
REDDER as more BLUE ENERGY engulfs the sheath.

             GARGAMEL
      Dumbledore, eat your heart out...
        (raising the sceptor)
      Soon, Papa, all your little Smurfs

      No.

             GARGAMEL
      Oh, please.  Did you really think 
      theyd go home without you?  After 
      all youve taught them?  Smurf for 
      all and all for... rubbish. 

             PAPA
      All for Smurf!

             GARGAMEL
      Exactly.  Youre one big happy 
      family.  And thats your weakness.  
      Theyre pathetic without you, Papa.  
      And youre the perfect bait.

             PAPA

      No!

             GARGAMEL
      Keep an eye on him Azrael...

Gargamel straps Papa into the essence extractor and fires it 
up.  Gears turn, steam HISSES and Papas begins to move into 
the works.

             PAPA
      Enjoy the ride, Papa.  Its Smurfy 
      time.

With a LAUGH, Gargamel charges out to face the Smurfs.

             PAPA (CONTD)
      Gargameeeeeeeeel!

EXT. BELVEDERE CASTLE - NIGHT

Gargamel rushes out with a huge sack to find Smurfs creeping 
through the undergrowth all around him.

With PENCILS for spears and LASER POINTERS to temporary blind 
Gargamel, the Smurfs hold their own in the first wave.

Annoyed, Gargamel stirs the sky with his scepter.  Thunderous 
CLOUDS appear, only over his portion of the park.  Rooftop 
Smurfs YELP and cling desperately to the rain gutters.  Others 
slip and slide in the localized wind and rain and mud.

ON BRAINY: watching with Gracie through the spyglasses.

Directly above the Castle, Gutsy struggles madly to keep the 
copter under control in the bizarre magic storm.

As Gargamel eagerly begins bagging fallen Smurfs.  Jokey waves 
a tiny white flag.

             GARGAMEL
      Hello!  What have we here?

             JOKEY
        (holding up a box)
      Surprise!

             GARGAMEL
      Im not falling for that again.

             JOKEY
      This isnt the surprise.  That is!

Gutsy ROARS in with the remote-control helicopter.  But as he 
grabs for the scepter... KARACK!  A bolt of LIGHTING from 
Gargamels storm blinds him... He misses.

ANGLE ON: Patrick watching through binoculars.

             PATRICK (INTO PHONE)
      He missed!  Were going in now!

ON BRAINY & GRACIE: Watching through spyglasses.

             BRAINY (INTO PHONE)

      Patrick!

Patrick hangs up and accepts a smear of blue face-paint from 
Vanity as he hoists Sams telescope onto his shoulder.  Its 
clearly been modified for war by Handy.

             HANDY
      Dont point it at anyone unless you 
      intend to hurt them.

Patrick grins.  The Smurfs, with pencil & rubberband bows 
and sewing needle arrows at the ready, raise a BATTLE CRY 
and follow Patrick down a hill toward...

GARGAMEL is busy shooting BOLTS of magic at Gutsy, who dodges 
for his life in the copter, hampered by the crazy weather.

Patrick, Handy and their group get in range and ready to fire 
on Gargamel when... Patricks phone RINGS.

             PATRICK (INTO PHONE)
      Gracie, honey, not now!

EXT. ODILES BEDROOM - NIGHT

Odile works alone in a huge bed, in the glow of her laptop.

                             INTERCUT WITH:

             ODILE
      Dont honey me, mon mignon.  Did you 
      get the man his little bleu thingies?

             PATRICK
      Odile?  I cant talk now.

Handy waves frantically at Patrick to fire.  Patrick peers 
through the sighting glass and... POP POP POP!  Lets loose a 
torrent of hardballs at Gargamel.  But they miss!

             ODILE
      Listen, forget Paris.  That strange 
      little of ours is going to do great 
      things for us.  Im going to need you 
      in, London, Hong Kong, Bejing...  

             PATRICK
      Thats not going to happen.

Gargamel takes final aim at Gutsy...

             GARGAMEL
      Enough of this!  Youre mine!  

             ODILE
      Oh, is he there?  Put him on.

             PATRICK
      Its for you! 

Out of ammo, Patrick hurls his Blackberry at Gargamel.

             ODILE (V.O. ON FLYING PHONE)
      Monsieur Gargameeeeeeeeeeel?

BAM!  The Blackberry shatters on Gargamels head just before 
he fires on Gutsy.  


THE SMURFS - Stem & Weiss - 6/16/09 
                                             97.

ON GRACIE: watching through Binoculars.

             GRACIE
      Huh.  Never thought Id be grateful 
      for that Blackberry.

ON GARGAMEL: Enraged, he turns on Patrick.  

             GARGAMEL
      That.  Hurt.

Gargamel unleashes a fury of BLUE ENERGY on Patrick, who 
SCREAMS and shakes in the beam.  But Gargamel doesnt stop.

ON GRACIE: She drops the spyglasses (and Brainy).

             GRACIE
        (racing down the hill)
      Patrick!

Like Braveheart, Gutsy seizes his moment... and the scepter.  

             GUTSY
      Frreeedooooooom!

Gargamel SCREAMS in rage as Gutsy ZOOMS away with his power.

             GARGAMEL
        (giving chase)
      Noooooooooo!

ON BRAINY as he recovers from being dropped.

             BRAINY (YELLING INTO PHONE)
      Sam!  Go go go!

INT. BELVEDERE CASTLE - NIGHT

Papa gasps for breath as hes washed, buffed and sterilized on 
the conveyor.  Azrael bats at him, like a toy, as he heads for 
a frightening steam extractor.  

Suddenly Sam charges through the door, flashlight blazing.

             SAM/SOPHIE
      Papa Smurf?!

             PAPA

      Look out!

Azrael GROWLS and steps into Sams path.  PLING!  He unfurls 
his switchblade claws in an elaborate show of might.

                                             98.

             SAM
      Did I mention Im alergic to cats?

Sam kicks Azrael out window with a YOOOOOOOOOWL.

ANGLE ON BRAINY: peering through the spyglasses.

BRAINYS POV: Sam races from the Castle with Papa.  

             BRAINY

      Yes!

BELOW: Gracie and Handy tend to fallen Patrick while Smurfette 
and Sophie charge in to free Smurfs from Gargamels bag.

             HANDY
      Boy, I am I glad to see you girls!  
      But whos cooking the Blue Moon 
      Potion?

             SMURFETTE
      Heftys got it covered.  Sometimes 
      the girls just gotta get out of the 
      kitchen.

She and Sophie share a Charlies Angels take.

ANGLE ON PATRICK: Gracie holds his face as the blue energy 
dissipates from his body.

             GRACIE
      Patrick?  Baby you can you hear me?

             SAM
        (rushing in with Papa)
      Dad!  Dad!

             SMURFS
      Papa!  Papa!

The Smurfs go wild, swarming their Papa as Sam sets him down 
to tend his own father with Sophie.  Its an emotional reunion 
for both families and their Papas.

Patrick GROANS as his family and the Smurfs surround him.

             HANDY
      He took Gargamels worst... for us.

             PATRICK
        (coming to)
      Gracie?

Gracie and the kids embrace Patrick as he sits up.

             SOPHIE
      Thank you, Daddy!  Thank you!

Papa, surrounded by his own adoring kids steps forward.

             PAPA
      Yes.  A hundred thanks.

             PATRICK
      You were right... Hands to help.

The two fathers share a smile.

             BRAINY (O.S.)
      Are we going home?  Or What?

Everyone turns to see Brainy standing proudly on a log.

             BRAINY (CONTD)
      Im sorry I didnt listen, Papa, but 
      a Smurfs gotta do, what a Smurfs 
      gotta do.

             PAPA
      Brainy, Im proud of you.  But youre 
      right.  We better get home while we 
      can.  Is everbody here?

             BRAINY
      All but one.
        (into phone)
      Blue leader to Blue Bird.  Come in.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST - NIGHT - SAME

Gutsy works the joystick on his belly with one hand and 
clutches Gargamels heavy scepter with the other.  Its rough 
flying.  Following below, Gargamel PANTS for breath.

             GUTSY
        (taunting)
      Ats it, ya little girrrly wizard!  
      Whos the bully now, eh?  eh?  

             GARGAMEL
        (winded, but smiling)
      Remember, little one... Pride goeth 
      before the fall.

             GUTSY
      What arrre ye talkin aboot?  Its 
      oover for ye, ya crrrazy loon.


THE SMURFS - Stem & Weiss - 6/16/09 
                                             100.

Gutsy doesnt see Azrael slinking up a tree, behind him.  
Suddenly... MEOWLLLLL!  Azrael leaps from a branch and swats 
the copter before crashing into a bush.

      GARGAMEL
Goooooood kitty!

GUTSY
Aaaaaaaaaaaaagh!

Gutsy, drops the wand and spins out of control, disappearing 
into the trees.

ON GARGAMEL: IN SLOW MO, he makes a diving leap for the wand 
as it tumbles toward an open subway vent.

Horses SCREAM as a late-night CARRIAGE stops just short of 
trampling Gargamel.  He stands, fire in his eyes... the 
scepter in his hand.

EXT. TURTLE POND - NIGHT

In the thicket by the pond Hefty struggles alone to add 
ingredients to the boiling pot. 

             HEFTY
        (reading)
      Hair of a Giant... Feather of a 
      flightless bird... 

The Winslows, Papa and the Smurfs charge onto the scene.

             PAPA
      Hefty!  Time to go!

             HEFTY
      Already, Papa!

Sophie and Smurfette rush in with Grouchy and Reina.  Everyone 
gathers around the pot as thick BLUE FOG spews from the brew.

             PAPA
        (unfurling the spell)
      Brainy... Do the honors?... You 
      earned it.

Brainy proudly, but humbly, takes the scroll and reads...

             BRAINY
      Unimoonibus... Bluticus... 
      Yarayak.... Kahol... 

WHOOSH!  A mighty WIND blasts through the park, spreading a 
thick FOG.  Veiled in the fog, a huge MOON appears to rise... 
its glow, distinctively BLUE.  The Winslows jaws drop.


THE SMURFS - Stem & Weiss - 6/16/09 
                                             101.

             HEFTY

      Look!

The pond waters being to roil.  As in the Forbidden Grottos, a 
glistening rock formation rises up.  A SHIMMERING PORTAL 
blazes behind the falling waters.  A rocky path emerges, 
leading to shore.

Suddenly, a horse-drawn carriage charges up in the distance.

             GARGAMEL
      Ya!  YAAAAAA!

             PAPA

      Go!  Go!

Lesser known Smurfs charge across the watery path and dive 
through the portal with hardly time to wave goodbye.

The carriage bears down with terrifying speed with Gargamel, 
standing beside Azrael, whipping the horses like Ben Hur.  
Panicked smurfs cross into the portal as fast as they can. 

Gargamel aims his scepter... ZAP!  A bolt of blue energy 
OBLITERATES THE PORTAL, trapping Papa and half the smurfs in 
our world while the other half are trapped in theirs. 

Gargamel aims again, this time directly at Papa and the 
remaining Smurfs.  As they SCREAM and scramble for cover, we 
hear the familiar whir of SPUTTERING ROTORS...

             GUTSY (O.S.)
      Pick on someone yer oon size, ya 
      smurrrfin wanker!

Gutsy has risen and is diving for Gargamel.

             PAPA
      Gutsy, noooooo!

BAM!  Gutsy kamikazees into Gargamels head.  The copter 
disintegrates, hurling Gutsy onto the horses face.  Gargamel 
falls back in the carriage, missing his shot.

IN SLOW MO: the wand flies through the air... little blue 
hands dive for it.  It falls to... CLUMSY.  He grabs... He 
bobbles... collapses... drops the wand into the murky pond.

             SOPHIE/PAPA

      Clumsy!

They run to help him.


THE SMURFS - Stem & Weiss - 6/16/09 
                                             102.

             BRAINY

      Gutsy!

All eyes turn to see the runaway horse, freaked by the blue 
creature clinging to its face, rear up at the WALL of the 
79TH STREET TRANSVERSE.  Gargamel, Azrael and Gutsy are thrown 
over the wall, toward the speeding traffic below.

   GUTSY & GARGAMEL
Aaaaaaaaaaagh!

AZRAEL
Yeeeeeeeeeoowl!

WHAP!  Gargamel and Azrael are comically flattened on the 
windshield of a passing bus.  It carries them away, with BLUE 
ad wrap celebrating: JET BLUE TO BELGIUM FROM $299!

Winslows and Smurfs are shocked at Gutsys sacrifice.  Then...

             GUTSY (O.S.)
      Well, doon jus stand thar!  Give a 
      Smurrrf a hand!

A tiny blue hand reaches over from the wall... Gutsys 
clinging safely above the speeding traffic.  The Smurfs CHEER 
as Sam, Hefty and others rush to pull him to safety.

Angle on Papa and Patrick.

             PATRICK
        (re destroyed Portal)
      What are you going to do?

Papa looks up at the moon as the fog clears away... Its 
clearly no longer blue.

             PAPA
      I dont know... I really dont know.

             HEFTY
      Hey... Look.

An inky BLUE spreads from where the wand went in.  The 
reflection of the moon is also blue, but the real moon is 
still only white.

Clumsy, lies weak on the shore, his head in Sophies lap.

             CLUMSY
      Im sorry guys... I-- blew it again.  

Spent and pale, Clumsys hand drops into the water.

             SOPHIE

      Clumsy?


THE SMURFS - Stem & Weiss - 6/16/09 
                                             103.

             CLUMSY
      I just wish... the moon was really 
      blue... and you all could go home.

Triggered at Clumsys hand in the water, the magic blue 
essence shimmers on the water.  BLUE ENERGY arcs over the 
surface of the pond, dancing on the reflection of the moon... 
Then, it rises up toward the Moon itself.

             GUTSY
      Grrreat Smurf!

Everyone looks up to see the Moon actually turning BLUE.  
Clumsys eyes open as the color begins to return to his hand,   
then spreads to his whole body.

             PAPA
      Great Smurf, indeed!  Clumsy!  Youve 
      done it!

Clumsy sits up, renewed as the portal begins to rise from the 
water again.  The Smurfs stare in awe as the rocky path re-
emerges to bear them home.

QUICK SHOTS ALL OVER NEW YORK: NIGHT-LIFERS and WILDLIFE stop 
to gaze up in amazement at the BLUE MOON.

IN THE PARK: Smurfs eagerly line up to walk the shimmering 
stone path to the portal, where Brainy directs them through.  
Each returns to their deep blue as they dive in. 

             BRAINY
      Come along everyone.  No telling how 
      long the spell will last.

Hefty approaches the portal, then turns and waves to the 
Winslows.

             HEFTY
      Good bye!  Well never forget you!

As the Winslows wave back, Hefty reaches out a tentative 
hand... WHOOSH!  Hes sucked through before he knows what 
happened.  A line of others wave goodbye and follow.

Gutsy, Jokey and Vanity and Romeo get in line.

             ROMEO
        (to Gracie and Patrick)
      Know how often Ive see love like 
      yours?
        (off their looks)
      Once in a Blue Moon.


THE SMURFS - Stem & Weiss - 6/16/09 
                                             104.

Patrick takes Gracies hand.  She pulls in close.

             PAPA
      Well never be able to repay you for 
      all your kindness...and bravery.

             PATRICK
      Youve already repaid me.  
        (squeezing Gracies hand)
      More than youll ever know.

Gracie smiles and takes Patricks arm.  He puts an arm around 
his family as they gather close around Papa and Clumsy.

             PAPA
      If you work together, and truly 
      treasure each other, everything will 
      be smurfy, indeed.

             REINA

      Smurf.

Everyone turns, LAUGHING, as Reina holds Grouchy one last time 
and utters her first words.

             REINA (CONTD)

      B-bye.

             WINSLOWS
      Shes talking!  Way to go Reina!  
      Good job, sweetie!  (etc.).

             GROUCHY
        (trying to hide his tears)
      I hate b-byes...  But I love you.

Sophie kneels down to Clumsy.  Her eyes are also welling up.

             SOPHIE
      Will I ever see you again?

             CLUMSY

      Papa?

             PAPA
      Keep an eye out for each other... 
      every blue moon.

Papas eyes TWINKLE as Sophie and Clumsy fall into a hug.

             SOPHIE
      Say its not just a dream.


THE SMURFS - Stem & Weiss - 6/16/09 
                                             105.

             CLUMSY
      Youre not dreaming, Sophie.  I am 
      your friend.

             BRAINY
      Papa!  Clumsy!  The spell!

Sure enough the BLUE ENERGY is FADING.  The Winslows share one 
last hug with Papa and Clumsy, then watch tearfully as they 
join Brainy and Smurfette at the Portal.

             WINSLOWS

      Goodbye.

             CLUMSY/BRAINY/PAPA/SMURFETTE
      Auf-Wiedersmurf!

Brainy waves and goes in.  Papa waves, takes Clumsys hand and 
steps in.  Clumsy locks teary eyes with Sophie... and hes 
gone.  The Winslows watch from shore as the BLUE ENERGY FADES 
and the Portal sinks back down.  But the moon... stays Blue.  

MUSIC UP: A NEW BLUE MOON SONG

                              FADE TO BLUE

END CREDITS:

The Smurfs return to their village, SINGING.  Reprising their 
dance number from the opening, this time, they get it right.

MORE END CREDITS.  Then...

Patrick sadly packs the personal effects of his office into 
boxes as he prepares to look for work.  Odile enters.

             ODILE
      What on earth are you doing?

             PATRICK
      Im... fired.  No?

             ODILE
      You silly, stupid, big strong man.  
      Do you know the last time anyone 
      stood up to me the way you did?
        (off Patricks confusion)
      You have what it takes to handle the 
      sharks in this office.  Up til now, 
      there was only me.  If you manage New 
      York... Im free to take to Paris.

She gratefully kisses his cheek and exits blissfully.

             ODILE (CONTD)
      Salut, Paris. Ici je viens!

Patrick watches her go... dumbstruck.

MORE CREDITS.  Then...

The Winslows frolic in Central Park.  Patrick and Sam fly the 
helicopter.  Sophie and Mom play princess nearby, while Reina 
chews happily on Tarzan.

Not faraway, in Turtle Pond, a wand is found... by Gargamel...
