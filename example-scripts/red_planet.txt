FADE IN:

MARS - VARIOUS SHOTS

Starkly beautiful, operatic landscapes.  Panoramas
revealing the Red Planet's arid, forbidding features:

Flat, rocky plains stretching to the horizon.  Red dunes 
of fine sand.  Ancient flood channels.  Abyssal canyons 
six miles deep.

                 CHANTILAS (V.O.)
       As our own planet reaches a point 
       where it may be uninhabitable
       in fifty years, we have begun the
       process of colonizing Mars...

EARTH - FROM SPACE

The familiar blue marble.  Only it's not so blue anymore.
More a sickly yellow-gray.

EXT. AMERICAN CITYSCAPE - DAY (2050)

A brutal, polluted, Malthusian nightmare.  Daylight so
bright it hurts.  The sulphurous, ozone-less sky casts
a pall over streets teeming with people, many wearing
respiratory devices and sun-protective clothing.

                 CHANTILAS (V.O.)
       ... Even as oxygen levels drop
       dangerously on Earth, algae
       introduced on Mars has been 
       creating what we hope will one day
       be an oxygen supply capable of
       supporting human life...

More images depicting 40 billion years of celestial
evolution unchanged by man:

Vast craters.  Icy, white polar caps.

An immense volcano, the base of which (though we have no
reference for scale) is large enough to cover Arizona.
A bright yellow sun setting in a pale gray-blue sky.

                 CHANTILAS (V.O.)
       ... Complications are part of 
       every endeavor, however.  And
       recently, the oxygen on Mars began
       to decline.  In order to discover
       the reason --

INT. APARTMENT LIVING ROOM  DAY (2050)

As a mother readies her young son for school, on a
TV we see a closeup of Bud Chantilas, 60.  Chironed 
below his name is a title:  "Chief Science Officer."

                                      2.

                 CHANTILAS (V.O.)
       -- We are about to embark upon the
       most ambitious undertaking in the
       history of human exploration:  the
       first manned mission to Mars...

The mother hands her son a lunchbox and raincoat.  Slips
a respirator over his mouth and nose.  Then kisses him
and sends him out the door.

                 CHANTILAS (V.O.)
       ... I am honored to be among the
       six people --

On the TV we begin seeing images of five other people:
four men and a woman, ages thirty to forty.

                 CHANTILAS (V.O.)
       -- chosen to become --

The mother crosses to a window, where the harsh, 
undiffused sunlight blasts through open blinds.

                 CHANTILAS (V.O.)
       -- Earth's first voyagers to 
       another planet...

She snaps the blinds shut, plunging the room into 
welcome darkness... A darkness which then becomes the
deep black of...

EXT. SPACE 

The endless universe.  Uncomprehended numbers of faraway
galaxies and star systems.  An oceanic emptiness to
object-seeking human eyes.  Which is why it's a relief
when we FIND...

The whole thing slowly turning as it floats (at 17,000
mph) silently through space.  As the ship floats by,
REVEAL... Mars.  Very large.  Very close.  Under which we
hear:

                 CAPCOM (V.O.)
       Mars-1, Houston.  You have
       acquired orbit.  Congratulations 
       on 182 days of smooth sailing, and
       welcome to Mars.  Houston out.

INT. MARS-1 - ACCESS TUBE - DAY

Inside Mars-1, ROBBY GALLAGHER, 40, has his face turned
to the daylight streaming in through a porthole.  
Sunglasses.  Aloha shirt.  Catching rays.

(NOTE:  Everyone communicates via comm-link headset)

                 GALLAGHER
       We get a good parking space?

Navy Lt. Commander KATE BOWMAN, 30, at the helm.  Calm

                 GALLAGHER
            (thinks, then)
       I like having one moon.  That
       way you just call it 'the 
       moon'...

                 SANTEN
            (rolls eyes)
       More color commentary from the
       janitor.

                 GALLAGHER
       Lieutenant Santen, the correct
       term is Mechanical Systems
       Engineer.

INT. MARS-1 - LAB - DAY

DR. CHIP PETTENGILL, 30, eager, pipes in from the

DR. QUINN BURCHENAL, 40, self-centered but good-natured,
works in the lab with Pettengill.

                 BURCHENAL
       To hell with the chit-chat.  After
       six months, I'm ready to get outta
       this hamster cage.  What do you 
       say, Bowman?

                 PETTENGILL
       Yeah.  How about it?

They're all chomping at the bit, and Bowman knows it.
She pauses.  Then --

                 BOWMAN
       Initiate all pre-launch systems
       checks, gentlemen.  We're eating
       dinner on Mars.

In a SERIES OF CUTS, we see the crew's individual 
reactions.  Six months of drills and boredom is about
to become the real thing.

Gallagher is last.  Turns his face from the sunlight.

                 GALLAGHER
       Finally.


7D
INT. MARS-1 - MEDICAL SPHERE - DAY (LATER)

Chantilas and Santen attach microchip biosensors to 
their chests.  Santen's still working on his chewing
gum.

                                      5.

                 SANTEN
       Last football game in high school,
       all the college scouts were there
       ... I knew I had to go out and
       play four perfect quarters... That
       game was my ticket out...

                 CHANTILAS
       ... I played rugby to hit and get
       hit.

Santen's still lost in his own thoughts.

                 SANTEN
       No room for mistakes today, 
       either.

Beat.  Chantilas sees how keyed up Santen is.  By way
of making a counterpoint to his nervous energy --

                 CHANTILAS
       My granddaughter's six today.

                 SANTEN
       Yeah?  Tell her 'Happy Birthday.'

                 CHANTILAS
       Sang it to her live... As live as
       one can be with a twenty-minute
       transmission delay.

Beat.  Santen stops chewing, momentarily calmer.

                 SANTEN
       ... She's turning six, and her
       Grandad's taking the first step
       on Mars...

Chantilas nods.  Santen starts working the gum again.

                 SANTEN
       Big day... Very big day...

Chantilas and Burchenal make a final inventory of
scientific gear to be transported to Mars.  Chantilas
hands over a piece of equipment.

                 CHANTILAS
       Better give the soil analyzer one
       last calibration test.

As Burchenal begins doing this --

                 BURCHENAL
       Got a nice speech planned for
       when you take that first step?

                 CHANTILAS
       I've organized a few well-chosen
       words.

                 BURCHENAL
       ... Armstrong's line was good.
       Tough to top that one.

                 CHANTILAS
       I'm not always consumed with being
       superior.

It's a friendly jab.  They're comrades after six months.
Burchenal laughs it off.  Hands back the analyzer.

                 BURCHENAL
       It's dead on.  Battery's at max
       charge.

            (then)
       Once you've had your big moment,
       we can start figuring out why
       oxygen levels took a nosedive
       up here.

                 CHANTILAS
       All of mankind's relying on us to
       find an answer.
            (as a punchline)
       And I'll be relying on you.

                 BURCHENAL
            (beat)
       If anyone can do it, it's me.

Six high-g seats are arrayed inside the small descent pod.
Stenciled-on names identify who will sit where.  Santen
and Pettengill check the MEV's onboard systems as Bowman
finishes pre-flighting the controls at her command seat.
Santen's still working his gum.

                 SANTEN
       Alpha Mach Indicator.

He snaps off a switch in a wall panel.  Snaps it back
on.  Pettengill watches a readout, sees a light flick
from red to green.

                 PETTENGILL
       Clear.

                 BOWMAN
       All set.  I'm going to the flight
       deck.

Starts out.

       O.M.S./R.C.S.

                 SANTEN
       Clear.

                 PETTENGILL
            (as Bowman passes)
       I'm still getting my head around
       the fact we're really doing this.

She goes.

                 BOWMAN
       Just keep it automatic.  Follow
       the routine.

                 SANTEN
       Optical Alignment Sight.

                 PETTENGILL
       Clear.

                 SANTEN
       Got half a million hits on my
       website yesterday... How many 
       you get?

                 PETTENGILL
       ... Eight hundred thirty-two.

Santen finds it funny.

       Inertial Measurement Unit.

                 PETTENGILL
       Clear... My public's small, but
       it's discriminating.  They actually 
       care about what we're doing... Your 
       fans are all teenyboppers.

                 SANTEN
       And you know you'd love having
       half of 'em... Master Timing Unit.

                 PETTENGILL

       I'll be on the flight deck with
       Bowman.

             himself)
       Five hundred thousand.
            (points at 
             Pettengill)
       Eight thirty-two.

He laughs, gives Pettengill a slug in the arm.  Then heads
out, passing Gallagher.  Snags Gallagher's aloha shirt,
wads it and tosses it back over his shoulder at him. 
Re:  Santen, when he's gone --

                 PETTENGILL
       Life's just like high school.

                 GALLAGHER

       It's jocks and us guys.

       You watch my back, I'll watch 
       yours.

As they cross to storage compartment and begin pulling
out a heavy, metal box --

                                      9.

                 PETTENGILL
       Who're you kidding?  You're a 
       jock.  You were on the NASCAR
       circuit...

                 GALLAGHER
       I tuned engines.  Not exactly
       jock stuff. 
            (then)
       Ears're still ringing.

As they lower the box, we see stenciled on it:  
"Autonomous Mapping Exploration and Evasion" with the
first letters of each word emphasized:  AMEE.

Gallagher slides a spacesuit sleeve onto his arm.  On the
sleeve is a flexible screen.  He activates it, and...

The metal "box" suddenly comes to life.  Unfolds like a
Swiss Army knife.  Extends four legs and a "head."  
Stands up on the two hind legs.  

As AMEE unfolds, the screen on Gallagher's arm flicks
on.  On it, we see whatever AMEE sees in AMEE-Vision
(basically a 180+ degree modified fish-eye panorama).

Gallagher whistles.  AMEE WHISTLES back.

       Hey, sweetie.

                 GALLAGHER

                 PETTENGILL
       She our navigator or your
       girl friend?

       Hey, it's been a long flight.
            (checking her systems)
       Looking good... Let's check
       your T.I.

He turns off the light.

On the sleeve screen we see what AMEE sees in the dark:
a thermal image of Gallagher and Pettengill.  Pettengill 
throws some punches in her direction.  AMEE doesn't move.

                 PETTENGILL
       Military removed her old reflexes
       before they transferred her, huh?

       She's your kind of woman.

Beat.  Gallagher switches something in AMEE's circuitry.
Hands her a pen.

                 GALLAGHER
       Gut him like a fish.

In a flash, AMEE thrusts her arm out at Pettengill and
whips it upward.  A blur of movement... But we see the
result:  there's a line drawn from Pettengill's navel to 
his sternum.  Pettengill shocked by the speed of the
attack.  Looks down at the ink mark running up his suit.

                 GALLAGHER
       That's my kind of woman.

                 PETTENGILL
       Real goddamn funny....  She
       could've hurt me.

                 GALLAGHER
       Don't make fun of my honey.
       They took away her knife, but
       underneath she's all Green
       Beret.

Gallagher fiddles with AMEE's circuitry again.

                 GALLAGHER
       She's back in navigator mode...
            (then)
       Okay, you're good to go.

He whistles.  AMEE WHISTLES back.

As her head and limbs fold up once more...

Bowman quickly begins to reset states.  Some hold, some

       Now!  Everything!  SEP, some kind
       of massive solar flare.

Santen's shutting off every system he can get his hands

       You, too.

From different locations, the crew hurries down access 
tubes and converges in the MEV elevator safe area.

The SHIP begins to flex.  CREAKS and WHINES.

The RADIATION ALARM'S STILL SHRIEKING.

Bowman and the men wait... wait... And then...

... a secondary wave of radiation hits.  Much more
powerful than the first.  Rips through the ship at the
speed of a bullet...

At 2000 FPS we see:

Paint warping off walls!--

Lights imploding!--

Electronics and circuitry being fried!--

The crew listening to the sounds of Mars-1's STRUCTURES
WEAKENING, beginning to come apart.

And then zap! it's gone.  Cooks off past the now-
motionless ship.

Inside the safe area, the crew shares a look.  Chantilas
opens the hatch.  The men emerge to find...

ALARMS SHRIEKING.  CIRCUITRY POPPING and FIZZLING.  U.V.

       I can't run damage assessment.  
       She's together now, but she might 
       come apart at any moment.

       Change of plans.  We're launching

them on.

The crew enters.  As they start cinching themselves into

INT. MARS-1 - FLIGHT DECK - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)

Bowman finishes preparing to abandon ship.  She's about
to go.  Reaches for a panel marked:  "MEV Launch
Release."  Flicks a toggle to "Arm."  The toggle won't
hold, snaps back to "Disarm."  She tries again.  Same
result.  The toggle won't stay on "Arm" unless Bowman
holds it there manually.  It only takes her a moment to
decide what to do next.  She's not happy about it, but
tries not to let her concern show --

       It's not up for debate.

                 GALLAGHER
       We'll fix the problem.

                 BOWMAN
       We don't know if the ship'll hold
       together that long.  I'm not
       risking the mission... Santen,
       it's your team now.  Hope you like
       the saddle... Lock it up.

Santen hesitates.  Has no choice... He POWERS UP MEV.
Seals the hatch.

       Crew secure?

                 SANTEN

As they respond, the looks on their faces say it all.
They're not just leaving her behind -- they know that by
staying, Bowman could very well be sacrificing her life.

                 ALL
       Secure.  Secure.  Secure.  Secure.

                 SANTEN
       We're green across the board.

       On my signal.

                 BOWMAN

She puts a finger on the toggle.  Then -- 

                 BOWMAN
       Get the job done.  A lotta
       people're counting on you.

Gallagher glances over at Pettengill.  Bowman flicks the 
toggle to 'Arm' and holds it there.

       Launch.

                 BOWMAN

Another moment... Then Santen slams two large buttons
on either side of him, and...

28

EXT. MARS-1 - DAY

EXPLOSIVE BOLTS BLOW.  As this is space, and a vacuum,
there's no sound.

29

INT. MEV - DAY

In here, however, it's loud.  The EXPLOSION REVERBERATES.
Then another EXPLOSION, and...

30

EXT. MARS-1 - DAY

MEV is blown free.  Again, oddly silent.  Small
maneuvering motors burn for a moment, nudging MEV out of
orbit toward Mars.

31

INT. MARS-1 - FLIGHT DECK - DAY

Bowman's alone, but she's got no time to worry about it.
There are still free-flows all over the board.  Bowman
can't get them to shut down.  They flicker, pop on and
off.  Systems start and shut down and start up again all
over the ship.  When suddenly...

31A

EXT. MARS-1 - DAY

The ship stops spinning.

31B

INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

Artificial gravity is lost.  Bowman is jolted by the 
sudden stop and begins tumbling in zero-g along with 
everything else not lashed down.

A red light comes on.  An ALARM sounds.  Bowman turns.
Smoke warning in sphere six.

INT. MEV - DAY

Descending.  Santen's throwing switches madly.

(NOTE:  Throughout MEV's descent, a COMPUTER VOICE 
announces various onboard systems failures.)

       Auto-guidance system's out.  Flare

Bowman frees a fire extinguisher.  Moves to the smoking
panel.  Yanks off the cover.  Aims the EXTINGUISHER.
TRIGGERS it.  And --

-- is hurled across the room by the force.  Smashes into
the far bulkhead... For a moment, though, it looks like
she's succeeded.  Then smoke begins to wisp out again.
She propels herself over, anchors her feet and jams the
nozzle into the panel.  Empties the extinguisher.  This
time it seems she's prevailed.  And then, in a gentle
digital V.O. Mars-1's P.A. --

MEV drops toward the planet at high velocity.  Sparks fly
off as the head shield cooks away.

39

INT. MEV - DAY

The high-g couches do what they can as the craft brakes
from 17,000 to 800 mph.  Santen tries to keep his eyes
focused on the gauges.  Gallagher's making a noise.
Humming a song behind clenched teeth.  Indistinct.
Almost a groan.  A groan that sounds a little like "Here
it comes, here it comes..."

40

EXT. MARS - DAY

MEV can't be seen, but a huge plasma trail can.  There's
a THUNDEROUS CRACK as the SHOCK WAVE reaches the surface.

41

INT. MEV - DAY

800 mph.  35,000 feet.  The needle passes a red mark.
Nothing happens.  As they continue to plummet, Santen
reaches over and with great effort, finds and pulls a
manual release lever.  We hear EXPLOSIVE BOLTS FIRE.

42

EXT. MEV - DAY

The top PANEL BLOWS off.  A drogue chute streams out.
And then main CANOPY WHOPS open.

The sudden deceleration pins them.  Eyelids flutter,
pupils roll back.  They're at the edge of consciousness.

OMITTED 

INT. MARS-1 - MEV DECK - DAY

More smoke.  Bowman's choking on it as she enters.  She
cracks a glowpanel for extra light, then moves to the
remaining spacesuit -- hers -- deflates the hanger that's
holding it, and hauls it on.  Yanks the hood over her
face and secures it, whereupon air begins feeding into
the suit... Bowman gulps it, relief for her searing lungs.

Still descending under the chutes.  Santen regards a
radar screen showing the Martian topography below them.

                 SANTEN
       We're off-target.  Terrain's
       crappy.

surrounding the entire outside of the craft.

The fire breaches the hatch to the access tube.  Bowman's
hurled across the room by the effect of the fire.  Beat.
Her eyes go to something.  She launches herself towards a
safety tether attached to a wall.  Clips on.  Reaches for
a control panel marked "MAIN HATCH" and throws it open.
And...

... instantly, Bowman's sucked toward the hatch, until --

-- WHAP!  The TETHER SNAPS TAUT.  Almost breaks her in
half.  Bowman a ragdoll on the end of the line.  Every
loose object on the ship starting to purge past her.
Smacking into her.  Bouncing off her.  The fire purging,
too.  Streaming around her body and head, nearly cooking
her alive as it vents into space.

49

INT. MARS-1 - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

49

Everything that's not lashed down is sucked toward the
Main Hatch... And then, as pressure equalizes with the
vacuum of space, the stream of flotsam slows and stops
flowing... The fires subside and die.  The ship is still
and dead.

The ALARMS CEASE.  With the pressure equalized, Bowman's
no longer being thrashed and pummeled at the end of the
tether.  She hauls herself to the controls.  Shuts the
hatch... The immediate danger's over.  And Bowman finally
allows herself a moment to be terrified.

50

EXT. MARS SURFACE - DAY

MEV crushes down on the uneven terrain.  Bounces.  Again
and again.  Rebounding, rolling, tumbling...

51

INT. MEV - DAY

A carnival ride from hell.

52

EXT. MARS SURFACE - DAY

A jagged outcropping.  MEV hits it.  Air bags tear open.

53

INT. MEV - DAY

The ride's now worse.  There's no cushion on one side.
Chantilas is directly over the unprotected area.  He
takes the brunt of each impact.

A horrible jolt rips loose Chantilas's g-seat.  He's
battered and rolled as MEV continues to tumble.   He's a
threat to all of them as he bashes about with each
rotation.  He takes a monstrous beating.

54

EXT. MARS SURFACE - DAY

MEV slowly grinds to a halt.  The bags that aren't in
shreds begin to deflate.  The icosahedron unfolds.  Opens
like a flower... And then silence.  Utter quiet that
seems to last forever.  When...

... the hatch blows.  A figure steps out.  Gallagher.  A
moment later, Chantilas is passed through the hatch.
He's unconscious.  Gallagher drags him a short distance
away as one-by-one, Santen, Pettengill and Burchenal
emerge.  Shaken but intact.  To Burchenal and
Pettengill --

                 SANTEN

       Yeah.

       He's coming around.

Chantilas's eyes slowly open.  Burchenal and Pettengill
join them.

                 SANTEN
       I don't feel any broken bones.
            (to Chantilas)
       We're here.  Everyone made it.

       How do you feel?

       Like someone's punching bag.

       The first one on Mars... Couldn't

       That's one small crash for man,
       one giant pile-up for mankind.

Chantilas and Burchenal smile.  For Pettengill, it's
no laughing matter.  And the joke makes Santen
uncomfortable.

Chantilas is propped against a rock, moving a device the
size of a paperback book across his abdomen.  It's a kind
of combination x-ray/sonogram.  He doesn't like what he
sees.  Clicks it off without showing anyone.

Nearby, Santen finishes doing something with his HHC
(book-size, 2050 descendant of a laptop).

                 SANTEN
       Distress signal's away.

Gallagher emerges from MEV.

                 GALLAGHER
       Radio's dead.  AMEE's screwed
       up... Repairs are gonna take time.

Burchenal and Pettengill have been looking through a pile
of broken equipment.  Exchange a glum look.  Then --

                 BURCHENAL
       Science package is k.o.ed, too.

       Shit.

                 SANTEN

       No more mission.

       Mission's not over yet,
       Pettengill.

                 PETTENGILL
       Oh, really.  You miss something?
       We lost the science gear.  We
       can't do what we came here to do.

       Quit whining.

Santen and Pettengill glare at each other a moment
longer.  Then, putting his command hat back on --

       range.

Santen turns his attention to his HHC.  Begins
calling up data.

INSERT - HHC

Hab info whizzes past:  schematics, a 360 degree pan from
the landing site, topo map of Mars... Santen zooms in on
the map to show where Hab's deployed.

                 SANTEN
       Based on the last uncorrupted nav
       state, I'd say... we're in
       this 60x120 kilometer ellipse.

Beat.  That's big.  That sucks.  And Burchenal's vast
intelligence can't accept it.  Re:  his HHC --

                 BURCHENAL
       All the mission data's in here.
       We just gotta close in on the
       downrange variables.  Tighten up
       the ellipse.  It's about the math.

                 GALLAGHER
       This is it.  That moment they told
       us about in high school, where one
       day we'd use algebra, and it'd
       save our lives...

They're already working on it.

       Shut up.

                 GALLAGHER
       Heard that a lot in high school,
       too.

Gallagher wanders off.  In b.g., we hear the OTHERS
discussing drag coefficients and whatnot.

Gallagher stares out at the Martian plain.  It'd be kinda
cool -- except he could die out here.  He yanks his HHC
out of the pocket on his thigh.  Mutters something.  The
Hab details appear.

Gallagher stares at the topo map.  Then the 360 degree

it some more.  Looks up.  Looks around.

       Hey, guys?

                 GALLAGHER

                 SANTEN
       What, Gallagher?

                 GALLAGHER
       I don't think it's about the math,
       I think it's about the picture.

       What picture?

       This one.

                 SANTEN

                 GALLAGHER

He holds out the HHC.  They walk over, look at the
panorama on the display.

                 SANTEN 
       We're not in that picture.  If we
       were, we'd know where Hab was,
       we're trying to figure that out.

Gallagher ignores him.  Tosses a rock in the sand.  Wraps
the panorama around it.  As he does, the HHC screen bends
and turns translucent.

                 GALLAGHER
       Say that's Hab.  About 30 degrees
       in the distance, it sees this
       mountain with the funny top.  At
       about 180 degrees, it sees this
       set of twin peaks.
            (indicates)
       Now, I see this mountain over
       there.  And these peaks over
       there.  And then this other peak
       maybe.  Which would put us on a
       line, say here.  Which leaves the
       angle to Hab about there.

       There's emergency medical
       gear at Hab.  We'll lock out the
       spine impulse.  If it's more

                 CHANTILAS
       He has to say no.
            (then)
       The four of you must carry on
       the mission.  It won't be easy.
            (then)
       Get going.

The four men look down at him a moment.

                 SANTEN
       You heard the man.

Santen starts off.  Burchenal and Pettengill AD LIB
their good-byes, then follow Santen.  Gallagher is last.
He's unable to go.  Chantilas meets his eyes.

                 CHANTILAS
       It's okay.  I got to see Mars...

Beat.  Chantilas sticks out his hand.  Gallagher
hesitates, then takes it.  The two men grip hands.
Chantilas releases him.  It's time to go.  Gallagher
turns, begins walking away.  After a moment, Chantilas
calls after him.

                 CHANTILAS
       Keep looking for that rock.

Gallagher turns back and salutes him.  Then continues on.

Chantilas watches him a beat, then takes a deep breath...
His eyes go to a stone lying in the dust.

With his finger, Chantilas traces a line in the dust
around the stone.  As he begins to trace another...

                 PETTENGILL (O.S.)
       ... It's not there.  Yesterday, I
       could see it.  Today, I couldn't
       find it.

INCLUDE GALLAGHER, SANTEN AND PETTENGILL

Doing various things nearby.  To Pettengill --

                 SANTEN
       What, you think Earth vanished?
       It's gone forever?

                 PETTENGILL
       I'm just saying it's weird not
       being able to see it.

                 SANTEN
       Okay, it's weird.  Get used to it.

Santen goes.  Pettengill looks at Chantilas and
Gallagher.

                 PETTENGILL
       It's not something I expected,
       that's all.

                 CHANTILAS

                 CHANTILAS
       Me, too.  But we don't have any.
            (crossing to him)
       When I want some, what I do is,
       I imagine I'm sitting down to
       breakfast in the restaurant in
       a five-star hotel, and a waiter's
       lifting the cover off a sizzling
       plate of bacon... And I can taste
       the bacon... I can taste it right

Pettengill goes, acknowledging Gallagher on the way out.
When he's gone --

                 CHANTILAS
       Some people aren't at home among
       the stars...

       My grandfather taught me to sail
       when I was a kid... He made me
       learn the stars in case all the
       G.P.S. satellites fell out of the
       sky at once.  Said anyone who put
       his life in the hands of anything
       run by batteries was a jackass.

                 CHANTILAS
       ... A real Yankee.

                 GALLAGHER
       He didn't like easy answers or
       quick fixes.  Wouldn't own
       anything he couldn't repair
       himself... he wouldn't've
       approved of this.

       Going to Mars?

                 CHANTILAS

                 GALLAGHER
       He'd say we're asking for more
       trouble.

                 CHANTILAS
       ... Say we didn't try.  We just
       finished poisoning the Earth, and
       everyone was dead in a hundred
       years.  Then what was the point of
       any of it?  Music, art, beauty,
       love.  All gone.  The Greeks,
       Gandhi, the Constitution, people
       dying for freedom and ideas... 
       none of it meant anything?  What 
       about religion.  Do we give up on
       God, too?

       You did just quit being a
       scientist one day, huh?

                 CHANTILAS
       My wife's death was violent,
       senseless.  The world I knew
       was shattered.  Science
       couldn't offer a way of 
       understanding it.  So I turned
       to philosophy.  Been searching
       for God ever since.

       No.  But we're gonna have a

       That's why you're here, isn't

       if my wife hadn't died in a plane
       crash... You could say it's partly
       a spiritual journey, yes.  The way
       out of the abyss her death opened
       up... Who knows?  I might find the
       answer to it all up there.

                 GALLAGHER
       Something that'll prove God exists?

                 CHANTILAS
            (smiles)
       Maybe I'll pick up a rock and it'll 
       say so on the bottom.  'Made by God.'

She's jumpered the circuits.  Has multimeters velcroed
all over the place.  Trying to reboot the entire ship.
Checks her loads, balances one more jumper, throws a
breaker.  The SHIP GROANS, FLICKERS TO LIFE, DIES.

She checks a meter, changes a jumper.

                 BOWMAN
       I'm not taking 'no' for an
       answer, you got that?  Do it.

She tries again.  This time the SHIP GROANS, FLICKERS TO
LIFE and STAYS ON-LINE.  Systems begin to come alive
around her.  Panels light up, turn from green to red.
Lights start to come on.  Artificial gravity returns.
Bowman can stand again.

                 BOWMAN
       Thanks for listening...

She moves to a set of valves.  Opens them.  AIR HISSES in
from an emergency supply.  She checks a meter, checks
again to be sure.  Then folds back the helmet of her
suit.  Breathes.

Bowman tries to bring the rest of the ship back to life.
Half a dozen systems are just plain dead and have to be

Light's beginning to come up outside.  Moments away from
entering the day side of Mars.  She opens a panel marked
"OBS" and throws a series of switches.  It works.

                 BOWMAN
       Okay, let's find the boys.

On a large viewscreen, Bowman can now scan the surface to
about one meter resolution.  She searches a spot.

At first, there's nothing but the crashed MEV in profile.
(Like a spy satellite, we are at an extreme angle, slowly
revealing more as MARS-1 grows less oblique and tracks
overhead.)

Then the severity of the damage becomes clear.  A body
lies near the wreckage.  There are no other signs of

then suddenly...

       No, I mean there is not one sign of
       the algae we sent up here... Even
       if it all died, there should be
       something.  A dried algal mat,
       traces on lee sides, something.

                 BURCHENAL
       He's right.  They're not just
       dead, they're gone.  Like they
       were scoured off.

                 GALLAGHER
       Maybe there was never anything in
       this valley.

                 PETTENGILL
       If we are where we think we are, 
       this area was covered with blue 
       algae as recently as a month ago.
       Valley before this one should have
       been blazing with orange-red
       chloroflectic.

                 BOWMAN
       Just pretend I'm your sister.

                 GALLAGHER
       I have two.  And neither one's
       this fine.

                 BOWMAN
            (a pause)
       The only way this works is if we
       both believe it doesn't matter.

                 GALLAGHER
       ... Like you could be Burchenal.

                 BOWMAN
       Well, maybe it could matter a
       little more than that.

                 GALLAGHER
       Okay.  So let's practice.  You go
       back in the shower and step out
       naked, and this time, I won't 
       make it matter too much.

Gallagher's sitting as before.  Thinking.

                 GALLAGHER
       Wonder if Bowman made it.

Burchenal sits nearby.  Thinks about it.

                 BURCHENAL
       I had a thing for her from day
       one.

Gallagher just looks over at him.  Beat.  Then --

                 GALLAGHER
       You think we were chosen 'cause
       we're single?  In case we died?

                 BURCHENAL
       I know I was chosen 'cause I got
       the only Macgregor Prize in bio-
       engineering.

Only Burchenal.  Who checks his readout.  Beat.

                 BURCHENAL
       Short time to live, but a long
       time to wait...

Santen stands on the edge of an abyssal canyon miles deep
and wide.  It's a glorious view.  FEET CRUNCH up behind
him.  Pettengill.  He falls in next to Santen.  After a
beat --

                 PETTENGILL
       I was going to get engaged when
       we got back.

       And a lotta girls're gonna miss
       me.

A long beat.  Then, almost as if he knows what
Pettengill's thinking --

                 SANTEN
       My flying ability isn't an issue
       now.  With Hab destroyed, it makes
       no difference where we landed.

                 PETTENGILL
            (beat; disbelief)
       You're out here calculating
       excuses...

                 SANTEN
       There's nothing to excuse.  It's
       moot.  No impact.

                 PETTENGILL
       What about Bud Chantilas?

                 SANTEN
       Moot.  He'd've died here anyway.
       Same as us.

                 PETTENGILL
       ... You're amazing.  Your life's
       about to end, and you still can't
       admit you failed at something.

                 SANTEN

            (beat)
       I can come across as a hardass.  I 
       know that.  But, technically, I
       didn't fail.

                 PETTENGILL
            (beat; stunned)
       I came here to forgive you.

                 SANTEN
       Yeah, well, screw you.  I don't
       need forgiveness from pussies.

Pettengill stares at him.  Hating him.  His face
contorted with hate.  And lashes out.  Does something
next that Santen wasn't expecting... He shoves him.

                                (CONTINUED)

Hard.  Past the edge of the cliff.  Santen's eyes are
wide with shock, but his training, his athletic ability
are already kicking in.

The shove upset his balance and every part of him fights
to regain it.  It happens for an instant.  Arms flail,
heels dig.  He reaches back.  Catches Pettengill's suit,
backhand.  Spins himself around.  Still off balance.

Still going over the edge if he lets go.  Reaching out
toward Pettengill with the other hand... And Pettengill's
following his own twisted instincts now, too.

With the shove, he's crossed an emotional threshold, and
he's not pulling back.  Fights Santen's hands.  Knocks
them away.

Only to find that each time they shoot right back and find
a new spot to grab.  Santen's desperate, clawing.  In
Earth's gravity, maybe he'd have gone over already.  But
here, now... he fights his way back onto his own feet.

Away from the cliff edge.  Wild with an adrenalized
survival energy that now turns to absolute fury.

Pettengill's no match for it.  Santen unleashes body
blows and head butts.  Savage enough to make a hairline
crack in Santen's own visor.

Even in the suit and helmet, the blows hurt.  He
slams Pettengill into the dirt.  Punishes him as they
roll in the red dust... but Santen begins to slow.  His
breath has been growing labored.  He's now gasping for
air.

Stops.

Darts a look at his readout.  Still has some air.  But the
exertion has been too much.  The suit's depleted supply
can't feed him what he needs fast enough.  He lets go of
Pettengill.  Hypoxia overcoming him.  Crawls away
on hands and knees.  Willing himself to move.  As if by
doing so he'll keep death at bay that much longer... And
now Pettengill gets up and comes over.  Enraged.  And...

... drives his foot down on Santen's head.  Slams it into
the ground.  Stunning Santen.  Then stomps him again.
Santen's visor spider-webbed by the crushing blow.  His
blood spattering against the inside of the cracked glass.
Like a windshield in a car accident.  A fatal one.

Pettengill stares down at Santen's head.

of the cliff.  Watches it fall.  It falls a long time.

EXT. HAB (MARS) - DAY

Burchenal's thinking aloud.  The dedicated scientist who
can't stop working through all the steps again...

                 BURCHENAL
       ... Mars' polar ice is mostly CO2.
       We use low-order nuclear detonation
       to melt the ice.  That releases
       CO2.  CO2 buildup creates a
       greenhouse effect.  Mars starts
       warming up.  When it's hot enough,
       we seed down some algae.  The
       algae grows and emits oxygen.
            (then, to Gallagher)
       Want me to shut up and let you die
       quietly?

                 GALLAGHER
       Nah, keep talking.  It's kinda
       peaceful.

                 BURCHENAL

            (beat)
       They sent us here to figure out
       what happened to the oxygen.
       Question now is, what happened to
       the algae?

Pettengill walks INTO VIEW around the remains of Hab.
Stops near them.

       Santen's dead.

                 PETTENGILL

They stare at him.  He's dirty and battered.

                 PETTENGILL
       He was almost out of air... Said
       he couldn't die like that.  Wanted
       to end it like a samurai... Jumped
       off the cliff...

Gallagher and Burchenal exchange a look.  Then Gallagher
checks his readout.

       I'm under a minute.  What's it
       gonna be like?

                 BURCHENAL
       Hypoxia?  Dizziness.  Skin'll
       tingle.  Vision narrows.  Then
       anoxia.  Shock, convulsions,
       acidosis...

       Gonna hurt?

       Yeah.

                 GALLAGHER

                 BURCHENAL

Suddenly, a WARNING TONE goes off on Gallagher's readout.
It gets slightly harder to breathe... then harder
still... Gallagher starts to gasp.  Falls to his knees.
Burchenal and Pettengill barely able to watch.  Know
they're next... Gallagher down on all fours now, sucking
hard on the last of his air... When suddenly all his fear
and anger and frustration peak, and in an act of
desperation and defiance, he unfastens his helmet.  Pushes
back the gelatinous visor.  And shouts...

                 GALLAGHER
       Fuck this planet!

A scream against the void.  Against death.  The final
word dragged out to the very last bit of air in his
lungs... Burchenal looks away... The word fades... Drops
to nothing... No air left to make a sound... The next
inhale will bring no relief.  But it can't be stopped.
It's reflexive.  Involuntary... Gallagher shudders,
holding back.  Until he can't any longer... and his lungs
contract.  Sucking in the worthless Martian atmosphere...
And... something unexpected occurs... Gallagher's still
on his feet.  No shock, convulsions and acidosis... He
exhales.  Inhales again... Then --

       I'm breathing.

                 GALLAGHER

He turns to Burchenal and Pettengill, who are watching in
amazement.

                 GALLAGHER
       It's like being at high altitude...
       but I'm breathing it!... We can

grin.

       I don't know what's going on.  But
       I'll sure as hell take it.

Pettengill's ALARM goes off.  Beat.  Much more
tentatively, he folds back his helmet and breathes, too.
Not rejoicing like the others.

                 PETTENGILL
       ... It's not possible...

Beat.  The enormity of what he's done hits Pettengill.

       Mars-1, this is Houston.  We got
       your message.  Looks like we got a
       world of trouble here, and you're
       carrying the load... We sent you a
       beacon as soon as we found out 
       about that solar flare, but the 
       flare beat us to you... Analysis
       of your telemetry indicates Mars-1
       orbital failure in thirty-one 
       hours.  Good news is we'll have
       out of there by then... We believe
       we can restore engine function for
       a main engine burn and exit from
       Mars orbit... The ground crew is
       presumed End of Mission.  They
       died trying to do their job.

make a pile of scraps from what's left of Hab.  To
Pettengill --

                 BURCHENAL
       Terraforming get even close to 
       creating breathable air up here?

Pettengill's distracted, still struggling with his 
conscience.

       No.

                 PETTENGILL

       And the oxygen levels were already
       dropping when the sensors all 
       died... So how can there be more 
       O2 now than ever and no algae to 
       make it?

       drone can't fly by itself.

Gallagher yanks something out of the wreckage.  Holds up
tangle of wires and chewed-up circuits.

                 GALLAGHER
       Here's the radio... so much for
       trying to reach Bowman.

He junks it.  Beat.

system.  The indicator's red.  Bowman wants green.  She
kicks the console.  Still red.  She gets on the radio --

                 BOWMAN
       Houston, Mars-1... No joy on all
       scenarios for engine ignition...
       That includes giving the console a

Using a small torch, Gallagher finishes lighting the pile
of scrap on fire, then stands back.

       Hab cost a billion dollars.  At
       least it's good for something.

We hear AMEE's DRONE in the dark overhead.  The men warm
themselves by the campfire.

                 PETTENGILL
       If the rover's radio works, we can
       tell Bowman there's breathable

       They taught us always to keep a

                 GALLAGHER
       That's what Chantilas and Santen

                 BURCHENAL

       Yeah.

            (to Pettengill)
       Which is why I have trouble seeing
       Santen tossing himself off any 
       cliffs.  Committing suicide.

Pettengill looks up --

            PETTENGILL
       ... His ego was too big... he 
       couldn't take failure... Believe
       me, I was surprised, too.

                 BURCHENAL
            (unconvinced)
       I'll bet.

They're about to continue... when they hear a sound out in
the darkness.  Something MECHANICAL.  CRUNCHING over 
ROCKS.  Beat.  Gallagher whistles.  Beat.  AMEE WHISTLES
back.  A moment later, she walks into the firelight.

                 GALLAGHER
       Way to get here, sweetie.
            (moves to her)
       How you doing?

He looks her over with his suit-light.

                 GALLAGHER
       Kinda banged up, huh?  Have to
       rename you LAME-EE.

The other two men join them.

       She seems a little outta whack.
            (to AMEE)
       Let's check you out... On your 
       back.

She obeys.  Puts her limbs in the air.  As Burchenal and
Pettengill look on, Gallagher opens AMEE's service port.
Looks around with the suit-light.  Then --

                 GALLAGHER
       Until she breaks down for good.

                 BURCHENAL
       We wait 'til she breaks down, that
       drone'll crash.  Let's yank her 
       Mars positioning system now.

One of AMEE's legs twitches.  Gallagher runs the logic.

                 GALLAGHER
       ... M.P.S. hard drive's modular.
       It's self-powered.  We could run
       it through an H.H.C.  We'd have
       command of the drone.
            (then)
       But that'd be killing her.

                 BURCHENAL
       Want me to pull the plug?

                 GALLAGHER
       No... I'll do it.

He makes a move toward AMEE... And what happens next
happens very fast...

AMEE slams Gallagher with the arm nearest him.  The force
of the blow knocks him ten feet.

With her two back legs, AMEE grabs Pettengill.  Squeezes
him.  Looks like she's gonna squeeze the life out of
him... Then uses her legs to throw him.  A very long way.
He lands hard and crumples.

Another arm already has Burchenal pincered by the wrist. 
Twists it.  Forces him to the ground in pain.  The way a
martial artist would.

Gallagher madly punches buttons on his sleeve unit.

       AMEE, stop!

                 GALLAGHER

AMEE rolls over.  Still holding Burchenal's wrist.  A
tin-can armadillo with the strength to keep a large man
on his knees.  Making him suffer.

And hey, she stops.  We think he's reached her... When
she plunges an arm into Burchenal's chest.  Not piercing
his suit or flesh, but jamming it in deep.  Using her
pincer-hand to grasp a rib.  Twisting.

The RIB SNAPPING horribly.  Burchenal screaming in pain...
Then AMEE withdraws her arm.  And moves off into the
darkness.

Gallagher goes to help Burchenal.  Pettengill stumbles
back, terrified.

       She's in military mode.  The crash
       must've flipped her back... Help
       me get him to the fire.

As they drag the groaning Burchenal --

                 PETTENGILL
       Why'd she turn on us?

We hear the DRONE ZIP by overhead.

                 GALLAGHER
       We tried to take her eyes.  That
       made us the enemy.

                 PETTENGILL
       You can't override her?

                 GALLAGHER
       I tried.  She won't respond.

They've set Burchenal down.  Gallagher examines him.

       Rib's broken.

                 GALLAGHER

                 BURCHENAL
       Tell me something I don't know.

            (thinks, then)
       She's playing war games.
            (off their looks)
       She's running through her military
       programs.  She knows she's unarmed,
       so she's using guerilla tactics.
       Breaking your rib was a version of
       an old Viet Cong trick.  Wound one
       of the enemy.  The others have to
       help, and it slows 'em down.  Makes
       it easier to pick 'em off.
            (beat)
       Sooner or later, she'll play
       search and destroy... And then
       she'll come and kill us.

There's a long beat as that sinks in.  Then --

                 BURCHENAL
       Even with AMEE out there, we'd
       better get what sleep we can.
       I'll take the first watch.

Bowman flips more switches.  Regards the engine ignition

off that scenario.  There's one more.  She takes a deep
breath.  Begins working through the steps... Reaches the
final one and...

... the engine ignition indicator goes green.

Bowman whoops.  Gets on the radio.

The last of the fire flickering out.  Gallagher's on

Gallagher switches on the AMEE-vision screen on his
sleeve.  We see just snow and interference...  Burchenal
stirs awake.

                 GALLAGHER

       Only hurts when I breathe.

       Sun's coming up in a couple

Gallagher indicates the sleeping Pettengill.

                 GALLAGHER
       You think he had something to do
       with Santen's death?

Pettengill does.

Gallagher regards AMEE's drone.

       Screw you.

As dawn breaks, Gallagher walks off a short distance.  To 
the drone, as he unzips the front of his suit.

                 GALLAGHER
       I'm taking the first piss on Mars.
       Wanna watch?

Hurting and shivering, Burchenal walks nearby and does 
the same.  Beat.

       Damn.  You sure get some arc in

       How're we gonna find our way?

                 GALLAGHER
       Have to make the best guess we can.

Burchenal sees the sun's just beginning to break the 
horizon.  Beat.  He suddenly grabs a titanium rib from 
Hab and shoves it in Pettengill's hand.

He power-screws off a cover.  Looks at what's inside.

       Well?

                 BURCHENAL

                 GALLAGHER
       It's a 50-year-old, off-the-shelf

Gallagher has cobbled together a radio from 50-year-old

while Gallagher carefully removes one of his two suit-
radio microphones.  Checks with a meter, then solders
it onto his jerry-rigged transmitter.

                 GALLAGHER
       Testing, testing...

He adjusts a tiny pot as he continues to call out.  A
green LED comes on, flickering with his voice.

       Does it work?

       Let's go.

As they head off --

                 BOWMAN
       I have work to do here.  Then I'll
       be in comm blackout on the dark
       side.  Call you when I come back
       around.

                 GALLAGHER
       Roger... And thanks.

                 BOWMAN
       Wish it could be more.

                 GALLAGHER
       Hey, it's something... and it's
       nice just knowing you're still up
       there.

                 BOWMAN
       ... I don't mind dying, but I hate
       the idea of being alone.  So you
       guys stay in high gear.  I want to
       see friendly faces around here
       again.

OFF which...

       Hi.

                 GALLAGHER

REVEAL Bowman in the doorway looking in.

She tries to look past him.  He moves to block her view.

       How you doing?

                 GALLAGHER

                 BOWMAN
       Fine... As soon as someone tells
       me why there's an indicator on
       the flight deck saying the
       temperature in here's above
       normal.  About ten degrees.

                 GALLAGHER
       ... Fahrenheit or centigrade?

A look.  Then she blows past him.  Finds Burchenal
tending a huge contraption of glass tubing, Bunsen
burners and filtration tanks.

                 GALLAGHER
       He's teaching me.  About biology.
       I've developed an interest in --

                 BOWMAN

       Fermentation?
            (then)
       A few billion taxpayer dollars in
       this mission, and you're using the
       lab equipment for a still.

                 GALLAGHER
       We're sterilizing it.

                 BOWMAN

       Nice try.
            (then)
       What's the fermentation base?

                 BURCHENAL
       Freeze-dried taters.

                 BOWMAN
       How would you propose I explain to
       Houston that two of my crew went
       blind on moonshine vodka?

       Carefully?

                 GALLAGHER

Bowman eyes them both darkly a long moment.  Then --

                 BOWMAN
       So, what, this establishment
       doesn't serve women?

They're off the hook.  Burchenal pours her a cup.  She
looks at it.  Tosses it back.  Woooof.

                 BOWMAN
       You making hootch or jet gas?
            (then)
       How much you got so far?

                 BURCHENAL
       About three liters.

                 BOWMAN
       You're done.  Dismantle this 
       thing.  Offer equal rations to
       Pettengill and Chantilas.
            (then)
       Lieutenant Santen doesn't drink
       or approve of those who do...
       Since he's on duty on the flight
       deck, what he doesn't know
       won't hurt him.  How much're you
       cutting this?

                 BURCHENAL
       It's about seventy-five percent
       alcohol... Can't believe you took
       it in one shot standing up.

                 BOWMAN
       I learned to drink in the Navy,
       boys.

OFF which, as Bowman pours herself another snootful...

INT. MARS-1 - PRIMARY SPHERE - DAY

Chantilas and Pettengill have joined Gallagher, Bowman
and Burchenal.  There's only a little vodka left.
They're all looped.

                 BURCHENAL
       ... I can figure out what went
       wrong on Mars.  I can probably fix
       it.  And then mankind'll build
       burger franchises and breed like
       guppies and destroy the planet, 
       too.  And then it's really
       good-bye, 'cause there aren't any
       more friendly ones... We're buying
       a couple hundred years, tops.

                 GALLAGHER
       Maybe we've learned a lesson from
       what happened on Earth.

                 BURCHENAL
            (beat; to Chantilas)
       There were frogs around when you
       were a kid, right?

       Yes.

                 CHANTILAS

                 BURCHENAL
       And then we killed 'em.  Every
       last one... Since frogs breathe
       through their skin and react to
       toxins in the environment faster,
       that should've been a warning,
       don't you think?  Canary in the
       coal mine kind of thing?

                 BOWMAN
       What's your point?

                 BURCHENAL
       Man's a party animal.  If we're
       doing okay, nothing else matters.
       That's not gonna change.

                 CHANTILAS
       Unless there are larger forces
       than biology at work.

                 BURCHENAL
       Uh-oh.  We gonna talk God now?
       'Cause I'll need another pop.

                 CHANTILAS
       Not God.  Faith.

                 BURCHENAL
       Faith?... Had a girl friend named
       Faith.  She cheated on me... with
       a girl named Chastity.

Burchenal's fun when he's drunk.

                 CHANTILAS
       You're riding 309 million
       kilometers into outer space and 
       back in a rocket ship nobody ever
       had time to test properly.  You
       don't do that without a little
       faith.

                 BURCHENAL

                 CHANTILAS
       Works that way with life, too.
       Sooner or later, we surrender to 
       things beyond our control.  To do
       that and still keep moving
       forward requires we believe in a
       right outcome.

                 BOWMAN
       Gotta have hope, right?

                 BURCHENAL
       Hope's just another way of 
       postponing disappointment.

                 CHANTILAS
       And I believe it's the only way we
       can realize the very best in us...
       Which, by the way, also happens to
       be a pretty good definition for
       God.

                 PETTENGILL
            (to Chantilas)
       If you're American, how come you
       sound British?

He's totally ignored.  Continuing --

                 BURCHENAL
       Listen, forget hypotheticals for a 
       moment, alright?... I say to hell 
       with humanity,.  I say we get to
       Mars, and we take it over for
       ourselves.

                 GALLAGHER
       Radio back?  Say it sucks and 
       don't bother coming?

                 BURCHENAL
       Whatever keeps out the riff-raff
       ... Chantilas can handle the 
       religion thing.  Gallagher can
       keep the space john working.
       Pettengill's...

       pretty much everything else.

Chantilas rolls his eyes, then stands, ending this line 
of discourse.

                 CHANTILAS
       And with that, I suggest we go
       to bed.

                 BURCHENAL
            (off Bowman's look)
       Think I'll take the suggestion.

He stands, and saying their "good nights," they head
out, taking Pettengill with them.  When they're gone --

                 GALLAGHER
       Heavy stuff.  Smart people.

                 BOWMAN
       How about you, Gallagher?  Never
       heard you express an opinion.

                 GALLAGHER
       Okay.  I think you should wear 
       a bra.

That shuts her up for a few moments.  Then --

                 BOWMAN
       Bras are designed to support your
       breasts on Earth, where there's
       real gravity.  Why would I need
       one in space?

                 GALLAGHER
       'Cause it's very distracting.
            (then)
       Not as distracting as seeing you
       step out of the shower, but...

                 BOWMAN
       I make sure to lock the door now.

                 GALLAGHER
       I know.  Tried walking in on you by
       accident a dozen times since then.

He looks serious.  Beat.  He smiles.  It's a joke.  A
smile breaks on Bowman's face.  Then --

       An observation.

Beat.  They're very close.  And very drunk.  It's when he
should kiss her.  But he doesn't.

The moment passes.  They both know it was there and now
it's gone.  Drift apart.  Feel stupid...

EXT. MARS SURFACE - DAY

Gallagher, Pettengill and Burchenal move across the
landscape strung out in a single line.  Miles from 
where they started.  Everyone's breathing hard.
Pettengill and Gallagher doing better than Burchenal,
who's dragging behind.  Right now, Gallagher's in front.

OVER the COMM-LINKS --

                 BURCHENAL
       Sure we're heading the right way?

       Pretty sure.

                 GALLAGHER

                 PETTENGILL

       No, no, there was one time.

       Of course, it turned out to be my
       assistant's fault.

Pettengill stops, suddenly alarmed.

       What's that?

                 PETTENGILL

                 GALLAGHER

            (stops)

       What?

Pettengill points off into the distance.

                 PETTENGILL
       Over there.  Like the ground's
       moving.

                 GALLAGHER
       I don't see anything.

                 PETTENGILL
       ... It's gone now.  But I
       definitely saw something.

Gallagher looks at him a moment, wondering if
Pettengill's hallucinating... When his eyes go to
Burchenal for the first time.  He sees that Burchenal's 
fallen way behind... And that AMEE's drone is
hovering directly over his head.

                 GALLAGHER
            (tense, concerned)
       Burchenal, you're too far back!

                 BURCHENAL
       Drone zeroing in on me?

       Affirmative.

As Burchenal picks up the pace, OVER the RADIO we hear --

       Gallagher?

Gallagher TURNS OFF his COMM-LINK.

                 GALLAGHER
       I'm off the comm-link.  What's up?

Bowman's never hesitated in the execution of her command
responsibilities.  She does now.  What she's about to say
is hard even for her.

       Bowman?

                 GALLAGHER

And then --

                 BOWMAN
       The only place to ride Cosmos
       is inside the rock sample
       container.

       Sounds comfy.

                 GALLAGHER

                 BOWMAN
       It's very small... Houston and
       Borokovksi have been going over
       the schematics.  They've done all
       they could to figure out how to

       They couldn't.
            (then)
       Only two people fit, Gallagher.
       Two people barely.

The news storms Gallagher's head.  He just stands there.
Trying to absorb it.

                 GALLAGHER
       ... someone has to stay behind...

       How we doing?

                 BURCHENAL

Gallagher hesitates, weighs telling him.  Then answers.

Burchenal's slowing again, the pain holding him back.  He
glances up at the sound of AMEE's DRONE over his head.
Tries to move faster.  Does for a few moments.  Then
can't keep it up.  Stops.

       Shit...

                 BURCHENAL

                 GALLAGHER

       ... I'm hurt, I'm tired, I'm
       thirsty... I can't do this.

He falls on the ground.  Gallagher sees and stops.

       Get up!

                 GALLAGHER

                 BURCHENAL
       Screw it.  I'm through.

The drone's circling like a buzzard.

Gallagher looks at him.  He and Pettengill could leave
now, and there'd be no decision about who's going on
Cosmos and who's staying behind.  Beat.  Beat.  Then
Gallagher starts hustling back to Burchenal.  Passes
Pettengill, who just watches him go by.

Gallagher reaches Burchenal.

Gallagher hoists him up.  It hurts, but Burchenal stands.

                 BURCHENAL
       ... This air's too damn thin.  I
       can barely breathe...

Gallagher puts a hand in Burchenal's back.  Starts
pushing him.

                 GALLAGHER
       C'mon.  Left foot, right foot, hop
       like a bunny -- I don't care.
       Let's go.

Burchenal groans, but he's doing what Gallagher says.  He
has no choice.  It's either that or fall on his face...
They plod ahead like that for awhile.  When Gallagher
starts singing --

                 GALLAGHER
       'Better stop, look around.  Here

END INTERCUT.  Gallagher and Burchenal are still a little
giddy.  Pettengill's looking around at the vast
nothingness.

Gallagher, Burchenal and Pettengill hustle down a hill.

       There's nothing big enough here.

                 GALLAGHER
       ... Winds could hit two-fifty.  I
       was stationed in Antarctica fixing

       If you didn't have a choice?  Dig
       a snow-cave.  I guess.

                 BURCHENAL
       So let's dig one.

                 GALLAGHER
       There's no snow.  And we can't dig
       rock.

There's a funky-looking hillock nearby.  Five feet high,
as big around.  Burchenal's gone over.  He kicks it.  The
soft volcanic rock crumbles away, revealing... snow.

       Permafrost.  

                 BURCHENAL

He scrapes away some.  

                 BURCHENAL

Gallagher puts a hand on him.

       Take it easy.  

Pettengill stops a moment.  Breathing hard.  

                 PETTENGILL
       We've come this far.  We gotta
       make it all the way.  We gotta

He finishes sealing the entrance.  They settle in.  It's
a very tight fit, but not bad considering.  Lit by their

hurt ribs.

                 BURCHENAL

The three men sit as the DUSTSTORM HOWLS outside.
Illuminated by their suit-lights... We see how really
trashed these guys are.  They look like an Everest
expedition caught at camp five for a month.  Dirty,
bearded, battered, sore, thirsty, hungry, tired, scared,
and now shivering with cold.  Burchenal has the added
burden of his injury.  Just checking the time like he
does now hurts like a motherfucker.

                 BURCHENAL
       How far's Cosmos from here?

Gallagher's lost in thought.  Finally realizes
Burchenal's asked him something.

       What?

                 GALLAGHER

                 BURCHENAL
       Cosmos.  How far you think it is?

       Borokovski better have a good

They sit in silence a while.  Burchenal thinking hard
about something.  Then --

                 BURCHENAL
       There's a thing... Something maybe
       science doesn't fully explain...
       That drives us on when everything
       else fails.  That extends itself
       to other people... Like when you
       kept me going back there.

Gallagher meets his eyes.  Beat.

                 BURCHENAL
       Chantilas would say it's got
       something to do with the Almighty.
       Maybe it does.  Or maybe it's just
       something special about the human
       spirit... Whatever, I'm grateful

       I didn't do it because I wanted 
       you to live.  I did it because
       I hated myself for what I was
       really thinking.

       What was that?

                 BURCHENAL

                 GALLAGHER
       That if I left you, I'd survive.

                 BURCHENAL
       What're you talking about?

                 GALLAGHER
       Cosmos only has room for two
       people.

Beat.  Burchenal and Pettengill can't believe it.

                 PETTENGILL
       You're saying one of us can't go?
       After all this?

                 GALLAGHER
       I've already decided.  You're both
       going.

            (off their looks)
       The mission's not over if you can
       get back and tell 'em what you've
       seen.  That's a helluva lot more
       important than anything I can
       offer.

            (then)
       I'll help you rig Cosmos.
       Then we say good-bye.

There's a long beat.  And a noticeable lack of argument.
Burchenal does have a conscience, though...

            (re:  Burchenal)
       Now he thinks I'm responsible for
       Santen's death.

Gallagher and Burchenal exchange a look.  Pettengill
can read into it.

                 PETTENGILL
       Don't you trust me, Gallagher?
       'You watch my back, I'll watch

       behind and take off with me?

                 GALLAGHER
       That's right, he is.

Gallagher's the only one you'd call awake.  But that just

She hears from Houston instead --

                 CAPCOM (V.O.)
       Mars-1, this is Houston.  
       Commander, we don't know about
       your clock, but ours is running
       out of time down here.  You've 
       been outta contact with 'em three
       hours.  Those boys came a long way
       on shoestrings, but that's a 
       ferocious storm, and no one could
       survive it... Here's where it is
       ... If you don't punch it in the
       next window, we're getting down to
       a gnat's ass.  You're risking your
       life, that ship, and the future of

       for what?... If they haven't made
       contact by the time you receive 
       this, you're ordered to return 
       home ASAP... We'll catch you 
       coming home... Houston out.

There's a long beat.  Then Bowman keys the radio.  Her
words are measured, her tone deliberate.

Next, he sees Pettengill's missing.

       Shit.

On screen, we see AMEE'S POV as she closes in on
Pettengill and runs him down.

There's nothing Gallagher and Burchenal can do about
what's going to happen next.  They can only watch.

Pettengill's cornered.  He turns.  Faces what he knows
is coming.  Accepting his fate.  Our vision's limited
to what AMEE sees.  There's no sound.  But the brutality
of her attack is plain enough.

then his eyes close.  The reaction of a dead man... And
then the screen goes dark.  Beat.

       There's still algae here.

He sweeps the beam out across the landscape.  Patches
of algae extend out beyond the reach of the light.
Glowing pink.  Burchenal bends down and grabs a handful.
The pinkish glow dissipates as he touches it.

                 BURCHENAL

                 GALLAGHER

                 BURCHENAL
       Some kind of nematodes.  They were
       eating Pettengill.  Sparks 
       ignited 'em.

There's a patch of algae near Burchenal.  He shines his 
light on it.  We see more nematodes.

                 BURCHENAL
       They're feeding on the algae.
       That's where it went...

                 GALLAGHER
       Thought there wasn't any life
       here.

                 BURCHENAL
       There shouldn't be.

Burchenal whips out a telescoping rod.  A titanium vial 
on the end.  

                 BURCHENAL
       They're gonna flip out over this
       back home.

He jabs the rod into the nematodes.  A sample is sucked
into the vial and frozen by liquid nitrogen.  The vial 
seals shut.

                 BURCHENAL
       Let's get moving.

They begin walking -- 

            GALLAGHER
       You sure it's smart to take those
       things with us?

                 BURCHENAL
       Smart?... You don't understand
       the importance of this, do you? 

                 GALLAGHER
       I'm the janitor, remember?

            BURCHENAL
       Earth's losing oxygen.  You see 
       how those things burned?  They
       make it.  They eat algae,
       and they make O2... Gallagher, 
       we don't have to move to a new 
       planet if we can save the old 
       one.

As Burchenal's words sink in -- 

OMITTED

EXT. MARS SURFACE - NIGHT (LATER)

Gallagher and Burchenal walk across a vast field of 
algae.  Gallagher pauses to look. 

                 GALLAGHER
       Been years since I've seen green 
       fields.

Burchenal's ahead of Gallagher, when something catches
his eye... The algae in front of him has begun to glow.
The glow swiftly surges toward him like a wave.  The
wave reaches his feet, surrounds him.  Burchenal shines
his light down.  In the beam, we see nematodes beginning
to swarm up his legs.

       Go back!

       What?

                 BURCHENAL

                 GALLAGHER

Burchenal runs back, the wave moving with him.

                 BURCHENAL
       Run, goddamn it!

Gallagher begins running back the way they came.

Burchenal's injured rib slows him.  More nematodes catch 
up.  The swarm of nematodes on his legs grows.  
Burchenal stumbles and falls.

Gallagher continues running... When suddenly the glowing 
wave surges into the algae ahead of him.  Gallagher
stops.  He looks around.  The wave of nematodes is moving
in on him from all sides.

Burchenal's on the ground, hurting, his body swarmed by 
nematodes, some already eating through his suit and 
beginning to devour him.

                 BURCHENAL
       Stay there!  You won't make 
       it!... Sons of bitches're already
       inside my suit...

Beat.  Burchenal struggles out of his life support vest.

                 BURCHENAL
       You're outta air.  You'll need 
       this for the launch.

He tosses the vest to Gallagher.  Then --

                 BURCHENAL
       You said you're not important 
       'cause you aren't a scientist...
       You're wrong.

Burchenal tosses him the vial containing the nematode
sample.

                 BURCHENAL
       Accomplish the mission, Gallagher.

       Burchenal...

                 GALLAGHER

                 BURCHENAL
       Put your helmet on.  It's gonna 
       get hot here in a sec.

Burchenal pulls out his ignition lighter.

Gallagher draws his helmet over his head.  Beat.

                 GALLAGHER
       So long, Burchenal.

Beat.  Burchenal manages a smile... Then triggers his 
lighter and drops it into the sea of nematodes.  
Instantly, they COMBUST -- an enormous, fiery chain 
reaction that EXPLODES out across the field and all 
around Gallagher.

This is too much... Even for Gallapher.  He starts to 
lose it.

                 GALLAGHER
       I can't... the worms... We found
       life... Burchenal sacrificed

He stops.  Swaying with exhaustion and the prospect of 
defeat.  Then drops to his knees.

       Yeah.  In Cyrillic.

Finds it anyhow.

       Launch diagnostics.  Avoid

He runs it.  Everything's in the green... until it
reaches "Ignition Power."  Green is 300 volts at six
amps.  There's exactly zero.  It's dead as a doornail.
The program suggests the replacement part number.
Gallagher stares at the readout, not wanting to believe

       First, about the worms... They 
       ate the algae.  Maybe Hab, too...
       But what's important is they make
       oxygen.  I guess that's why we
       could breathe.  Burchenal says 
       they might even be able to save 
       Earth.  So get someone back here
       quick.  And tell 'em to be careful
       ... These things are omnivores.

AMEE walks right up to him.  Not a pause.  Raises an arm
into the air.  Gonna plunge it into Gallagher's brain.
When...

... at the last possible second, Gallagher jerks away
from the death-blow.  Rolls over.  Underneath Cosmos.
Triggers a switch he's wired there, and...

BOOM!  Cosmos' PARACHUTE SHOOTS out of its box, which is
positioned so as to kick the chute out laterally.  The
chute engulfing AMEE.  Gallagher now rolling out from
under Cosmos.  Pulling out his torch, and...

... the fuel-soaked parachute EXPLODES into FLAMES.  The
fire all around her.  Burning up into her maintenance
port, which Gallagher'd opened to Hab and never closed
again.  Melting circuitry and wiring there.

Even as the parachute burns away, the fire in AMEE's belly

finally...

Gallagher grabs an arm.  Flips her over.  Stabs the
rod deep into the open, smoldering port on her underside.

the rod into her one more time, and the pincers release,
the hand falls.

Gallagher reaches into the second port again, dredging up
AMEE's E-source -- a power cell the size of a soda can.
Disconnects it.  If this were the jungle, AMEE would be a
slain animal, the battery would be her heart -- and
Gallagher would celebrate his victory by eating it.  Here,
now, he's gotta get into space...

130

SAME SCENE - FEW MINUTES LATER

130

Gallagher finishes jerry-rigging the battery inside AMEE.
Shuts the battery port and begins sweeping rocks out of
the sample container -- his "capsule."

Gallagher's about to pull his helmet over his head...
when he stops... He rips something.  Skewers it on the
rod that finished off AMEE.  Bends OUT OF FRAME and does
something we can't see.  Gallagher turns back to Cosmos.
And now we see...

... the American flag patch from the shoulder of his
suit.  "Flying" from the rod.  Planted in the Martian
turf.

Gallagher pulls his helmet on.  Looks at the tiny rocket
with its rock box.

                 GALLAGHER
       This should be interesting....

Gallagher slides into the sample container.  There's
supposed to be room for two.  There's barely room for
one.  But he's in.

Beat.  Gallagher takes several deep breaths.  Closes his
eyes.  And punches it.  We hear the IGNITION kick ON...
and then, with a GRINDING ROAR, the thirty-year-old
ROCKET MOTORS COME TO LIFE.

Inside his capsule, Gallagher's rocked by vibration.

132

INT./EXT. COSMOS - NIGHT

132

The wide canyon where Cosmos lies lights up from the
enormous EXPLOSION of the ENGINE.

And, slowly at first, the little ship begins to rise.

Gallagher's rattled harder by vibration.

And now, as Cosmos picks up speed, the g-forces press him
against the hard floor of the box.

The heat shield glows bright red two inches from
Gallagher's face.

When the second stage kicks in, the force rips the shield
away completely.

MICRO DUST PINGS against Gallagher's visor.  Inside the
helmet, his eyes and ears begin to bleed.  His face
distorts from the 9-g's pulling down on him.

Cosmos reaches the atmospheric envelope.  And bursts
through.

Released from Mars' gravity and atmospheric friction,
Cosmos accelerates.

Gallagher's head is snapped sideways by the increased
velocity.

And then, at last, the second-stage ROCKET MOTORS 
SPUTTER and DIE.  The second stage falls away... Cosmos
floats in the deathly quiet of space...

INT. MARS-1 - FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT

133

Bowman's making final preparations for her return.  When
her eyes go to a screen on the instrument panel...
Something's shot up into the atmosphere ahead of her...
She looks up from the screen, looks out the window.
Beat.  It hits her...

       Abort.  Reroute.  Orbital
       maneuvering.  Power the O.M.S.

She flips a joystick out from underneath the dash in
front of her.

                 BOWMAN
       I need roll, pitch, yaw, X, Y, Z.

She's flying the ship now.

EXT. MARS ORBIT - NIGHT/DAY

Small HYDROGEN BURSTS begin to shift Mars-1.  Bit by bit
the large ship dives down into a lower orbit to catch
Cosmos.

135

INT./EXT. COSMOS - NIGHT

Gallagher drifts on the edge of unconsciousness.  On his
wrist display, we see that Burchenal's life-support pack
is running low on air.  Mars-1 approaches.  Closer and
closer.  More HYDROGEN BLASTS slow Mars-1.  Both ships
nearing the daylight.  And when Mars-1 is as close as
Bowman dares bring it...

136

INT. MARS-1 - FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT

She triggers a final breaking burst.  Throws off her seat
harness.

137

INT. MARS-1 - VARIOUS SHOTS - NIGHT

Bowman races through the ship.  Exits into...

138

INT. MARS-1 - HAB RETRIEVAL DECK - CONTINUOUS ACTION -

Bowman runs herself across the room.  Jams her feet into 
EVA boots.  Moves upward into the EVA upper body section. 
Locks it shut.  Fully encased now.  Like a large
crustacean with legs.

Gallagher's out of air.  He's either unconscious... or
dead.  Cosmos and Mars-1 entering the sunlight now.

INT. MARS-1 - HAB RETRIEVAL DECK - DAY

                 BOWMAN
       Seal this level!  Open the dock!

The large outer doors of the dock open.  Air and loose
items purge.  Gallagher and Cosmos float 300 yards away.

Bowman unclips her suit from its anchoring device and
yanks something off the wall.  Like a 40mm grenade
launcher with a power retrieval cable.  Bowman shoulders
it.  Aims.  Pulls the trigger... the device emits a thin
laser beam.

regards a readout on the gun: "OBJECT OUT OF RANGE."  She
lets go of the gun.  Looks around.  Propels herself up to
the long "Canadian arm" which is used to bring Hab into
the bay.  The arm attached to a linear acceleration track
pointing out the open hatch.

A receptacle on the back of Bowman's EVA suit matches the
large Hab retrieval ball on the end of the arm.  Bowman
backs herself against the ball.  Clips her suit onto it.

                 BOWMAN
       Last acquisition.  Line release.
       Full velocity.

And the linear accelerator shoots the arm down the track
and hurls Bowman out into space.  The ball stays embedded
in her back.  Trailing a line back to Mars-1.

143

EXT. MARS ORBIT - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY

143

Bowman flies toward Gallagher and Cosmos.  No means of
stopping herself.  Crashes hard into Cosmos.  Momentarily
stuns herself.  Then recovers.  Moves to Gallagher.  Puts
her visor against his.  And screams.

                 BOWMAN
       Gallagher!  Gallagher!

She's shouting at the top of her lungs, but inside
Gallagher's helmet there's only a muffled HUM transmitted
through two face-plates.  Bowman grabs onto Cosmos.  Says
something we can't hear.  The linear accelerator yanks her
violently backward.  Begins retracting Bowman and Cosmos
back toward the open Hab retrieval bay.

Mars-1 is swallowing up Bowman, Cosmos and Gallagher.
At 45 mph.  They almost make it through the door cleanly.
Cosmos catches slightly on one side.  Flips them around
as they plunge inside.

144

INT. MARS-1 - HAB RETRIEVAL DECK - CONTINUOUS ACTION -

Cosmos rams the end of the arm.  The arm fractures away
but still stops Cosmos from ramming through the inner
bulkhead and destroying Mars-1.

                 BOWMAN
       Seal!  Emergency atmosphere!  Now!

The OUTER DOOR SLAMS SHUT.  The room is buffeted in a
white mist.  The atmosphere is restored.

Gallagher's limp, unresponsive.  Bowman checks his
readout.  No air.  No heartbeat.

                 BOWMAN
       Not after all this, damn it.

She grabs an emergency cutting tool.  Hooks it into the
front of Gallagher's suit.  Rips it open from stem to
stern.  

A first-aid station is bolted to the wall.  Bowman grabs
a pair of paddles from a defibrillation unit.  Jabs them
against Gallagher's chest.  As she triggers them --

145

INSIDE GALLAGHER'S BODY

We FOLLOW the ELECTRICAL SHOCK as it courses through
neural networks and reaches his heart.  ZAP!  Nothing.

sees there's no response.  Dials up the defibrillator.
Hits him with the paddles again.  Once more --

       We were put into a situation we
       didn't expect and weren't ready
       for.  We all made mistakes.
       Things we'd take back if we

       the end, we accomplished the

       That's what people should
       remember.  That the men who died
       down there were all heroes, too.

Beat.  Gallagher reaches into his pocket.  Pulls out a
rock and looks at it.

       Memento?

                 BOWMAN

                 GALLAGHER

       I'll say it again:  you're not
       who I thought you were.

Gallagher meets her gaze... then draws her to him and
kisses her.  It's been a long time coming.  They both
make it last.  And then, holding her, smiling, looking
into her eyes --

                 GALLAGHER
       Universe is full of surprises.

And that's the way we leave them.  Holding each other.
Tired.  At the beginning of a long journey.  The CAMERA
PUSHING IN ON the small rock in Gallagher's hand until it
FILLS the FRAME and SLOWLY TRANSFORMS INTO...
