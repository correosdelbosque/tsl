FADE IN:

EXT. VINCI COUNTRYSIDE - RENAISSANCE - DAY

A TRAVELING MERCHANT WITH AN UNFORGETTABLY ETCHED FACE
rambles past a timelessly beautiful Italian countryside
on a trusty mule.

A jaw-droppingly storybook castle looms before him. The
merchant dismounts and pulls forth a cask of wine. Set-
tling down upon a tree stump, he removes his hat and
inhales the fresh air with a life-loving sigh.

The merchant brings the cask to his lips when suddenly a
LOUD EXPLOSION is heard causing the merchant to douse
himself with a blast of vino.

                 UNFORGETTABLE MERCHANT
       Leonardo, che pazzo...

The merchant shakes his fist up to a swish pan that
swings up toward a smoking window of the awesome castle.

The charismatic LEONARDO DA VINCI, with his trademark
beard, drifts through the smoke of a mammoth room. A
flash of light causes him to put on a pair of very early,
very cool sunglasses. Something extraordinary reflects
off them.

Da Vinci moves to the Something, a gloriously incredible
machine.
The opening CREDITS REVEAL its dazzling idio-
syncrasies.

TWO COUGHING APPRENTICES haplessly try to disperse smoke
from the still billowing, mysteriously spectacular
Machine.
Mirrors attached to parts of it reflect beams
of light which cut through the smoke like a Renaissance
laser show.

                 DA VINCI
       Marcolino, mettiamoli il plumba.

The apprentice throws a lever. A shunt near the furnace
turns.
Steam escapes upwards.

Da Vinci's pride goes dead as the implications hit.

The apprentices scurry out. Mind reeling, Da Vinci turns
his back to the viewer, before a wall of frescoes.

Spinning back around, using the edge of his cloak, Da
Vinci pulls out the large gleaming crystal with a pop.

INT. DA VINCI'S WORKSHOP

With an accompanying blast of smoke, Da Vinci bursts
through some double doors into his workshop, sadly
reflecting upon the crystal in one hand and the tonged
bar in the other.

His workshop is a spendiferously enigmatic blend of
laboratory and studio; On a table in the foreground is
a fresh clay equestrian statue; a large VOLUME of
sketches, the inkwell nearby; a MODEL of what looks like
a HELICOPTER; Da Vinci flings the tonged bar on the table
among these goodies.

Pocketing the crystal, Da Vinci meanders through his
workshop casually tinkering with various experiments.
Leonardo stops at an easel displaying a finished-except-
for-the-mouth portrait of Mona Lisa, who happens to be
seated in a stool before the easel. She broadly smiles,
revealing the worst dental work of her epoch. Da Vinci
shakes his head and moves out onto a

       O.K., one coat, one hat. Some personal
       items.
There's your wallet. I think
       you'll find everything in there.

A black hat is dropped onto the counter. A black coat is
then dropped beside it.

                 SKEETER
       Haven't seen one of these in a
       long time.

                 HAWK
       Like that, Skeeter? Keep it.

                 SKEETER
       Hey, you got to sign for this!
       Don't you want the receipt?

                 GATES
       I got him, Charlie. So the Hudson Hawk
       is finally getting out. Remember all
       the reporters that were here when you
       came in?... "World's greatest cat
       burglar." Now, who gives a fuck?
            (turning serious)
       I've got a proposition.

                 HAWK
       Answer's no, Gates.

                 GATES
       As your parole officer, I've found
       you a job.

       No way.

                 HAWK

                 GATES
       It's a terrific job. An auction
       house.
One night's work and you're
       free.
No checking in with a shrink,
       no community service...

                 HAWK
       I want to do community service. I
       want to teach the handicapped how
       to yodel. I ain't stealing no
       more, Gates.

                 GATES
       Ten years later, you're still
       impressed with yourself. Same old
       coat, same old hat. You're extinct,
       Hawk, out of style.

                 HAWK
            (to trenchcoat)
       Coming from you that's a powerful
       statement. Look, aren't you
       supposed to stop me from committing
       crimes. You know, Book-em-Dano,
       Give-a-Hoot-Don't-Pollute.

Hawk and Gates come to a final checkpoint. Gates jiggles
in and out of his pocket, a set of keys.

                 GATES
       You ain't out yet, wise guy. I
       can set you up and send you back
       any time I want. It's a very fine
       line between ex-con and escaped con.

                 HAWK
       Gates, Gates, Gates. Go fuck
       yourself.

                 GATES
       This hard-on's got my keys.
       Seymour! Be seeing you, Hawk.

Gates moves to the bars and reaches in his pocket. It is
empty.

Hawk strides to the Massive Sliding Concrete Door/Wall
between him and freedom. As music crescendos and Hawk
glows his first smile.

       On the gate!

                 GUARD

                 HAWK
       See you around, Michael.

                 GATES
       Hudson Hawk, you're under arrest.
            (cackles)
       Just kidding. Good opening line
       though, huh? I've got a
       proposition....

                 HAWK
       Answer's no, not even if you
       bathe.

The Concrete Wall/Door slams shut behind Hawk.

                 GATES
       Why do you treat your parole officer
       with such disrespect? I've found
       you a job. An auction house. One
       night's work then you're free like
       no ex-con's ever been. No checking
       in with a shrink, no community
       service teaching retards how to
       play air hockey. It's a great deal,
       I can't lie.

                 HAWK
       The only thing you can't do is get
       sex for free. I know I was in
       prison for basically the 80's,
       but, call me batty, aren't you
       supposed to stop me from committing
       crimes. You know, Book-em-Dano,
       Call-for-back-up, Give-a-Hoot-
       Don't-Pollute.

Hawk begins to strut off. Gates and the car keep up.

                 GATES
       You wouldn't be out if it wasn't
       for me! I did the dog and pony
       for you! You think the parole
       board would have let you out after
       what you did to them?

       How was I supposed to know they
       were women?

                 GATES
       You told them they looked like the
       Three Stooges!

                 HAWK
       One of them was bald and kept
       saying "Sointinly."

Gates simmers himself with a self-control smile.

                 GATES
       Remember that guy in the cell next
       to you who hung himself?

       Yeah.

                 HAWK
Scratchy...

                 GATES
       Remembeer that shoe you lost...

                 HAWK
       Uh, yeah. Now that we've
       established my photographic
       memory...

Gates pulls on a glove and is handed a shoe from a STONE-
FACED DRIVER.

                 GATES
       One phone call and your shoe will
       become a piece of evidence "found
       in Scratchy's cell" and his
       suicide'll become a murder.

                 HAWK
       Gates, I don't want you to take
       this the wrong way, but this is
       the fucking stupidest thing I ever
       heard in my life.

                 GATES
       This is the beauty part. It's
       bullshit, but I can make it stick
       because I'm a good guy parole
       officer and you're a bad guy who's
       about to find out that there's a
       thin line between ex-con and
       escaped con.

A PRISON GUARD from above loudly click-loads his rifle.
Gates gives the shoe to Stoneface and the car roars off.
An identical police car, lights flashing and no siren,
zooms up in its place.

                 GATES
       What's your favorite sport, Hawk?

Gates opens the back door of the police car and says
"Baseball."
He is handed a baseball bat. Hawk backs
up as Gates moves threateningly toward him.

                 HAWK
       I meant, ping pong. Listen, I'd
       rather go back in than whore for
       you....

            (stopping)
       Oh, have you got ten dollars on you?

A PRISON GUARD from above turns as not to be a witness.
Hawk feebly calls up to him.

       Help?

Police?

                 HAWK

Gates swings at Hawk, who pretends not to notice until
the last second. Hawk ducks and slam-kicks his calf.
Gates crumples, using the bat as a crutch. Hawk boots up
the bat for a two-handed catch. Gates cowers in fear of
becoming a home run. Hawk lowers the bat and gives him a

       I don't believe this. I've been

A BACKFIRE rings out. Hawk hits the ground, thinking
it is a gunshot.

HAWK'S ON THE GROUND P.O.V.

A gasping 1960 Caddy comes to a stop and a pair of a too-
fancy-to-be-tasteful shoes comes out. Hawk looks up to
see TOMMY 5-TONE MESSINA, his older, maybe-maybe-not-wiser
best friend.

                 TOMMY
       That's the first thing I did.
       Smooch the ground and taste the
       freedom. Sorry I was late, Eddie.
       Miss anything?

                 HAWK
            (getting up)
       As always, your timing, as your
       shoes, is impeccable... Don't tell
       me those things are in style now.
       Good to see you, Tommy 5-Tone,
       been having a lousy day.

       Water Ballet pageant? Believe me,
       it's overrated.

Hawk pauses to say something, then just hugs Tommy.

                 TOMMY
       Where's the kiss? No tongue this
       time, I promise.

A laughing Hawk gives Tommy's stomach a slap before
getting in the car....

                 HAWK
       Looks like you've been expanding
       your...

The Caddy thunders past a sweet Manhattan view. "Come

pletes an intimidating hand puzzle.

       That's your definition of "Hard?"

       Show off. Hey, boss tune. "Let's

       ask you a question, you still
       think you're the greatest cat
       burglar who ever lived?

                 HANK
       Nope.
Now I'm the laziest damn
       cat burglar that ever lived. I'm
       giving it up. No more stealing.

                 TOMMY
       Now that you're born again, what
       do you wanna do? Statue of
       Liberty? Entertain some ladies?
       Broadway tix? Seduce some women?
       Play Nintendo? Bone some chicks?

                 HAWK
       What's Nintendo? Just get me to the
       5-Tone. If I don't get a cappuchino
       soon, I'm going to strangle someone.

                 TOMMY
       You still got a thing for those
       unmasculine European coffees?...
       Who's your buddy?

Tommy pulls a styrofoam cup from a paper bag.

                 HAWK
       The man knows, the man knows!

Hawk takes off the cap with a stimulating whiff.

                 TOMMY
       So tell me, Mr. Coffee, what went
       down outside the prison?

                 HAWK
       Oh, not too much. Gates tried to

Tommy brakes and cappuccino flies. Hawk half-heartedly
tries to lick up with his fingers.

Tommy quivers a folded tabloid over to Hawk, who
anxiously unfolds it.

The tabloid headline glares MONKEY SLAIN IN GANGLAND HIT,
above a chilling photo of a monkey-sized chalk outline on
a dark street (an archive picture of a healthy, happy
monkey is in the inset).

Hawk loses all control with a helpless howl. The

It's changed.
Hawk and Tommy enter into what has become
the ultimate pseudo-art deco-fern littered-nightmare,
packed with noisy, INSUFFERABLY SELF-ABSORBED YUPS.
A violently erotic and pretentious video plays upon
elevated T.V. sets set up all around the place.

Hawk's mouth gapes as he drifts by a sickening COUPLE
toasting wine coolers, and two very YOUNG BROKERS high-
fiving each other after missing a dartboard.

                 TOMMY
       I didn't know how to tell you. A
       couple brokers stopped in for Stoley
       Spritzers one night. Next thing I
       know Fast Track Digest votes us
       "Watering Hole of the Month." Now,
       I'm shopping for Aqua Salmon wallpaper.

                 HAWK
       I read about these people in Newsweek.
       Where's all the regulars, Crazy Jeff
       Cava, the Todd sisters, Indian Joe?
       Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph? You
       took down Captain Bob's steering wheel?

                 TOMMY
       All gone. But look on the bright
       side, half the joint is yours.
       Blackjack, get my irritable partner
       a cappuccino. I gotta go be a boss.

Tommy lifts a piece of the bar and moves behind it.
Snatching up a menu, Hawk calls out...

                 HAWK
       Reindeer Goat cheese pizza? I
       admit, I've been known to go wild
       and order a Canadian Bacon in my
       time, but.. reindeer goat cheese?

Hawk lights up a cigarette. A TORTOISE SHELL NON-SMOKER
immediately turns to him wearing a "Yes, I mind if you
smoke" button.

       Can you read....smoker?

                 TORTOISE SHELL NON-SMOKER

            (Huh?)

       No.

                 HAWK
       The Candy Man can, Felix. You
       know, I thought this was a country
       where you could do any stupid
       thing you wanted; drive to work
       naked, spank a chiropractor, make
       love to a V.C.R. Maybe that's why
       I became a random collector of
       kneecaps.

                 TORTOISE SHELL NON-SMOKER
       Hey, big guy. Smoke all you want.
       Have mine....

                 HAWK
       Thank you, Jesus.

The Non-smoker fumbles out a pack of cigarettes and
flees.
Tommy slides a cappuccino in cup and saucer down
the bar saloon-style. A smiling Hawk picks it up, turns
away from the bar and closes his eyes, bringing the cup
to his lips until it EXPLODES re-splattering coffee over
Hawk's war-torn blazer. Nobody notices.

All Hawk sees is the usual sea of oblivious and loud
self-obsession until he scans to a far corner table of
Mafia types where a cocky thug ANTONY MARIO, smiling
directly at Hawk, thrusts a silencer-gun back down his
pants.

The threatening, hair-slicked-back leader, CESAR MARIO,
gives Hawk a come-hither finger wiggle.

BACK OF THE BAR

With concern, Tommy watches Hawk walk over to them.

                 HAWK
       Cute shot, Antony.

                 ANTONY
       Fuck you, Eddie.

With sudden ferocious anger, Hawk cracks Antony across
the jaw into a chair. A SCARFACED BODYGUARD, pulling
a knife, is kept in check by the cool Cesar.

                 HAWK
       Cesar Mario, Antony Mario, when
       did the circus get in? Who killed
       my monkey?

                 CESAR
       Hawk, my hand to God, didn't whack
       little Eddie...I never had anything
       against that kooky chimp. I
       actually found him, "endearing."

                 HAWK
       Yeah.
Face down. Two endearing
       shots to the back of his endearing
       head.
That's your trademark, Cesar.
       What did Little Eddie ever do to...

                 ANTONY
       So some little banana eater got
       iced, what's the big...

Hawk is ready for another thwack, but Cesar defuses him.

                 CESAR
       Shut up. Why won't you do the
       auction house?

                 HAWK
       Auction houses are very popular this
       season. Call me superstitious, but I
       don't like to commit a crime less
       than 24 hours after getting out
       of the joint.

Cesar reveals a black canvas bag as Hawk wearily sits.

                 CESAR
       It's very simple. There's a safe
       on the seventh floor. You take
       their From the safe you take out
       a thingie and put it in this
       thingie...

                 HAWK
       Or you cut off my thingie.
       Directions even your brother
       would understand.

                 ANTONY
            (defensively)
       Yeah, directions even I could
       understand.

                 CESAR
       Silence. Hawk, you're the best.
       No one but you can do it. So don't
       give me a line of bullshit about
       how you really want to go straight,
       open a hardware store and sell
       spatulas...

       You know what, Cesar, if the Mario
       brothers weren't Jersey's third
       largest family, I'd say kiss my ass.
       But considering your status, I'll
       say slurp my butt.

Antony angrily pulls out his silencer-gun. Tommy merrily
comes forward with a bottle of wine.

                 TOMMY
       Have you lovely folks tried our
       house wine. I think you'll
       enjoy...

                 ANTONY
       Beat it, Tommy, no dinosaurs
       allowed.

Tommy equally merrily smashes the bottle over Antony's
head.

                 CESAR
       Enough! I'm going to tell you
       something. Forget Gates, forget
       your little shoe. You don't do
       the job and I'm going to put you

       They're playing at Shea.

       Figures. I got to be robbing an

                 TOMMY
       Since when are you a Mets fan?

       I've always been a Mets fan.

The wires go up to a row of seven humming, RECORD button

Tommy presses the REWIND buttons on the V.C.R.'s.

INT. SEVENTH FLOOR AUCTION AUDITORIUM--NIGHT

Moving beneath a video camera and a dazzling set of
Hanging Horse Mobiles, a Heavyset guard, BIG STAN, moseys
through the dimly lit main auction house auditorium. The
auditorium chairs are strewn out in the middle beside a
turbo Floor Washer.

Next to a painting of Happy Children Riding Horses at the
back of the auditorium stage, Big Stan hefts himself upon
a comparatively TINY BLUE CHAIR and begins to tip back
and snooze.

INT. GUARDS' STATION

The Security Guards look to the seventh floor screen to
see an unfolding shot of Big Stan mid-snooze.

Tommy goes up to a circuit box and pulls down two large
switches.
Strenuously upbeat Ray Conniffesque singers
continue to sing the song, orchestrally accompanied, when
Tommy and Hawk are not.

With the soundtrack singers taking over, Guard Two sips
a cup of coffee. He doesn't swallow.

His sights zero in on the Blue Chair on the seventh

He looks to the chair remains, then back again.

INSTRUMENTAL

1st CHORUS

  Would you like to swing on a star

  Carry moon beams home in a jar

  And be better off than you are

  Or would you rather be a mule

1st VERSE

  A mule is an animal with long funny ears

  He kicks up at anything he hears

  His back is brawny and his brain is weak

  He's just plain stupid with a stubborn streak

  And by the way if you hate to go to school

  You may grow up to be a mule.

  Carry moon beams home in a jar

  Or would you rather be a fish

  A fish is Ann... Won't do anything but swim in a brook

  He can't write his name or read a book

  To fool the people is his only thought

  And though he's slippery he still gets caught

  But then if that sort of life is what you wish

  You may grow up to be a fish

3rd CHORUS

  Would you like to swing on a star

  Carry moon beams home in a jar

  And be better off than you are

  Or would you rather be a pig

3rd VERSE

  A pig is an animal with dirt on his face

  His shoes are a terrible disgrace

  He's got no manners when he eats his food

  He's fat and lazy and extremely rude

  But if you don't care a feather or a pig

  You may grow up to be a pig

Hawk bolts right at the bustling up guards and locks them

A malevolently snobbish British Butler, ALFRED, enters in
distaste.
He makes a stressful glance to three VANITY
FAIRS on a coffeetable that has a photo of a MAGNETIC
HUSBAND-WIFE-DOG COMBO with the caption: MAYFLOWER POWER.

Suddenly a line across Gates's neck turns red and blood
begins to gush like a tourist attraction. Gates crashes
down upon the table holding the punch bowl and the stereo,
sending it to the ground, cutting off the music. The Dog
Poker picture falls atop the carnage like a lid.

Blown away, Hawk tries to wiggle his way out of the
recliner.
Alfred wipes off his blade with a handkerchief.

       Took Mr. Ed humptied dumptied it over
       Gates's head. And gets this, he said

                 TOMMY
            (professorial)
       Ah yes, a rare Renaissance piece.
       Da Vinci's "Sforza," an equestrian
       model of a never executed statue.
       I consider it to be the prize of
       tonight's auction of objets
       d'equestrian. Horse things.

The cappuccino machine sparks. A perplexed Hawk takes
a couple extra seconds to back off.

                 HAWK
       Okay, you got me, Mr. PBS.

                 TOMMY
            (holding up newspaper)
       Morning edition.

       Attempted!

                 HAWK

                 TOMMY
       Seems two thieves "attempted" to
       steal it last night, but thanks to
       three "courageous" guards, it will
       be ready for tonight.

                 HAWK
       "Attempted." At-tempt-ted! I
       didn't want to steal the thing in
       the first place, but I do have my
       pride.
Face it, when it comes to
       burglary, and sex, I....

Hawk takes the newspaper. There is a picture of the
Three Security Guards in a cheery pose behind the
"Sforza."
Hawk squints to see that Security Guards One
and Two are still wearing the thumbcuffs.

                 HAWK
       Uh, this I don't understand...

                 TOMMY
       Forget about it, I mean, why try?
       Eddie, you know the game, what are

       Cops, Mafia, and butlers forcing me
       to commit a crime which now it appears
       I didn't commit at all -- It's all too
       fucking peculiar for me. Let me ask

       tuxedo cost?

INT. RUTHERFORD'S AUCTION HOUSE--NIGHT

49

Dressed in his not-quite-fitting but suave blazer, Hawk
enters the now well-lit auction house auditorium (chairs
all set out).
Bored WORKMEN in coveralls lug equestrian
items on to a podium from the familiar freight elevator.

                 ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
       ... fan-taas-tic example of
       Florentine bronze... Who will start
       at 140,000? 40,000... 160,000...
       180,000... 240,000.

Someone raises their paddle as Hawk passes beneath the
hanging horses and finds an aisle seat near the stage.
AN ENCHANTINGLY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN suddenly takes the
aisle seat next to him. Hawk inhales some smitten
steam as she concentrates on the stage.

                 HAWK
       All these years (of attending
       auctions) (coming to these auctions),
       I still get goosebumps. The paintings,
       the sculptures.... the things that
       aren't really paintings or sculptures...

                 THE WOMAN
       ....the pretentious vultures who don't
       even look up from their calculators to
       see what they're buying. Now that gives
       me goosebumps. Auctions are disgusting.

The Woman laughs at his gear switch then catches herself.

       Lot Fifteen, an equestrian piece

AUCTION ENTRANCE

Big Stan, the hefty guard from the heist, enters the area
wearing a blue ribbon.

AUCTION AREA

51

Big Stan is walking in back of the seated bidders: An
oblivious Hawk in the foreground starts to scan VARIED
BIDDER-TYPES, raising their paddles to babble out dollar
figures; a GAUDY ROCK STAR and his GLOOMY-CHIC ENTOURAGE,
A KING FAROUK-TYPE with a BORED TEENAGE AMERICAN HOOKER,
and a scary NORDIC PRINCESS in a monocle and a tiara.

THREE STANDING ASSISTANTS frantically man a table of
phones set up down before the stage. One raises his
arm.

                 ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
       Sold!
To the caller from
       Newfoundland.

A STYLISH FEMALE ASSISTANT takes out an impressive replica
of the "Sforza" from the safe behind the podium and brings
it to the Auctioneer. The crowd a-a-hs...Hawk laughs
and shakes his head.

                 ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
       And finally, Lot number 17,
       thought to be lost in the war,
       and again last night, the Da
       Vinci "Sforza," the jewel of the
            Fan-taas-tic...
sale.

                 HAWK
            (re: Auctioneer)
       Is looking like a constipated
       warthog a prerequisite to getting
       a job in the art world?

                 ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
       There have naturally been questions
       of its authenticity, so to verify
       we have Doctor Anna Baragli of the
       Vatican. Doc?

                               (CONTINUED)

                 ANNA

       constipated than others.

                                      34.

51

Hawk uneasily laughs as Anna makes her way up the stage
and pulls out a large magnifying glass. A look of
distress passes over her face. Hawk closes his eyes in
anticipation.

                 ANNA
            (suddenly serene)
       Perfection. The Vatican extends
       its jealousy to the lucky bidder.

                 ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
       We'll begin the bidding at 20
       million dollars. To you, sir.
       20 point 5. Twenty-one. Your bid
       madame -- twenty-one point 5. Twenty-
       two.
Twenty-two point 5.

Hawk opens his eyes in confusion. He scans Anna coming
off the stage, gliding toward the phone table. Hawk
floats into the aisle, curling toward her as she picks
up a phone and murmurs into it.

                 DARWIN MAYFLOWER
       100 million clams (smackers), Waldo!

The crowd orgasms as Vanity Fair cover boy, DARWIN
MAYFLOWER works the aisle, playfully mussing up the
appreciative, tiaraed Princess's hair, giddily high-
fiving the Rock Star, and smooching the Hooker.

                 ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
       100 million dollars to Mr. Darwin
       Mayflower.

Hawk turns to gaze at the enigmatically familiar figure.
Anna looks up from the phone to do the same. She
swerves her attention to the back-turned Hawk.

Darwin moves to one of two reserved empty seats as his
wife, Minerva, makes her entrance par excellahnce. She is
outrageously dressed with a mammoth Tiffany watch that
extends from her wrist down to, acting as a leash,
her obnoxious little dog, BUNNY.

                 MINERVA
       100 million and one. Waldo.

                 MINERVA
       Don't hate me, baby... Bunny.

                 ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER
       Fan-taas-tic, the bid is at 100
       million and one dollars. Any more bids?

Commencing a slow motion sequence, Big Stan comes out
of a nearby door, zipping up his fly. He immediately
scopes Hawk in the space before the stage.

The Mayflowers lower themselves into their seats with
devoured canary smiles.

       Go-ing!

                 ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER

Big Stan pulls out his gun, untheatrically, as not to
cause a scene.
Anna sees this and follows Big Stan's
eyeline to Hawk.

Hawk turns to re-pursue but stops dead at the sight of
the gloating Big Stan.

       Go-ing!

                 ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER

Big Stan launches a gallop toward Hawk, who spins and
veers back round up the aisle.

The Mayflowers zero their sights on the activity.

       Gone!

                 ECCENTRIC BALD AUCTIONEER

The gavel comes down in super slow-motion.

Anna's leg pokes out of the aisle, tripping the guard.

Hawk brakes at the end of the Mayflower's row and smiles
in relief, casually turning to Darwin and Minerva.

The gavel continues to come down in super slow-motion.

Both Darwin and Minerva Mayflower suddenly DUCK DOWN.

Smile vanishing, Hawk spins toward the stage.

Breaking out of slow-motion into wide-angle, the entire
podium explodes sending debris, equestrian pieces, and
eccentric bald pieces searing into the screaming,
battered crowd.

Knocked off his feet, Hawk gropes into a standing
position.
He sees the Mayflowers make a smooth exit.
He starts to give chase until he sees a battered Anna
rising from the ground.

A hanging unicorn cracks from the damaged ceiling and
swooshes down towards Anna.

Hawk bolts upon some auction chairs and makes a flying
leap.
He slams Anna out of the unicorn's pulverizing
Path.
They weary up off the ground and move down the
aisle, calm in a storm of panicked art patrons.

                 ANNA
       My God, that was bold of you,
       you didn't have to do that...

                 HAWK
       It was nothing--anybody would
       have done the same thing--
       It's an impulse...

                 ANNA
       No, I meant you didn't have to
       tackle me and rip my dress.

       Oh.

                 HAWK

Anna touches Hawk's lips and laughs.

                 ANNA
       I was just kidding. Thanks for
       saving my life, tough guy. Why
       was that guard chasing you?

                 HAWK

his skull, pokes his head next to Cesar's.

Cesar and the Bodyguard/Driver turn to Antony and scream,

Hawk, with an unchanged expression of pure white knuckle
fear, comes to a tranquil gurney-wheels-gently-squeaking
stop, beneath an underpass bridge.

Lit by the flames of the ambulance crash, a sneering
young man in wire rim glasses emerges from the darkness,
carrying a steel suitcase. He kneels before Hawk and
opens the suitcase revealing a complex computer appara-
tus.
He begins mumbling into a cellular phone.

Hawk opens his mouth to speak when a malevolent, SILENT
DEADPAN WRAITH eerily glides down a wire from the bridge.
Both agents are dressed in outfits that seem to be a
melange of fascist uniform and haute couture.

On the fingers of one Wraith hand is carved the word HATE.
On the other hand is the word FROG. The Frog Hand hands
a befuddled Hawk a card. It reads: MY NAME IS KIT KAT
AND THIS IS NOT A DREAM.

Hawk looks up with a "huh" expression as Kit Kat chops
his neck, knocking him off the gurney.

The sneering computer guy hangs up his phone and pulls
forward a small designer cattle prod from his apparatus.

                 HAWK
       This is turning out to be a very
       bad night.

                 SNICKERS
       When it rains, it pours. Name's
       Snickers. The plane leaves in 40.

Snickers zaps Hawk in the leg with his strange-noised
device.
Hawk a-a-ghs into a fetal position. Snickers
returns to his suitcase and is passed by a PLEASANT YOUNG
BLACK WOMAN in the "outfit."

                 ALMOND JOY
       Almond Joy. I know, it's silly. But
       it's better than when we first started
       out, our code names were Diseases. Do
       you know what it's like being called
       Clymidia for a year.

       Whoops, forgot....

She deftly kicks the rising up Hawk across the face, flip-
flopping him onto his back. A nearby portable potty booth
slams open, revealing the biggest member of the group.
He
fe-fi-fo-fums out and slams the door. The back of his coat
catches in the slammed door. He obliviously moves forward,
dragging the potty forward. He stops with a confused ex-
pression, then continues moving forward with the lavatory.
He then quickly turns, tipping the big potty onto himself.
The other agents shake their heads.

                 BUTTERFINGER (poking his head out)
       My name's Butterfinger.

                 HAWK
       No shit. (really)

Rumbling up, Butterfinger effortlessly picks up and props
up Hawk on the gurney. The mysterious group parts to re-
veal a much more mature and cynically subdued man dressed
in big lapels and a hat.

facial move.

                 DARWIN
       Listen, for those kind of wages, I
       could have built the factory in
       America! They're Vietnamese, but
       don't they know they're Vietnamese,

       auction, asshole?

       Because I didn't want to get hurt,
       taterhead.

A FAX MACHINE comes to life as Darwin babbles.

                 DARWIN
       What can I tell you, I'm the
       villain. Initially it was a
       priority to keep a lot of buffers
       between you and me, but since most
       of them are dead now, I thought
       what the heck. Hawk, you come
       highly recommended. I would have
       done some things differently at
       the auction house, but hey, I want
       to be in business with you.

Darwin scans the Fax message with annoyance, and then
shoves it into a violent paper shredder.

       I'm sorry, I have to take this.
       Those are valid points though...

Darwin picks up the phone and goes Mr. Hyde, while giving
Hawk "Can you believe this guy"-type gestures.

Darwin holds the phone over a 50 cent piece-size siren in
his armrest.
Darwin presses a button and a PIERCING

Darwin bolts out. Hawk hangs back, waiting for Rod

       the "Sforza" for reasons other
       than putting it in the Da Vinci
       museum we're building in Vinci.
       Hopefully, these organizations
       think our plan has been ruined

       If I seem vague, grand. We want a

Lying atop the table in heels, shades, and a heart-

audibly spew from a headset she wears.

Surrounding the table is a VARIED GROUP OF OLD MONEY AND
NEW MONEY BOARD MEMBERS ranging from a nine year old
INDIAN PRINCE to a SWEET ELDERLY AMERICAN WOMAN. They
converse to the person at their side in businesslike
tones, oblivious to Minerva.

The board applauds as Alfred pushes Hawk inside.

                 MINERVA
       Hello......Bunny, Ball-Ball!

Minerva lobs a ball in the air. Bunny, the annoying dog,
scurries beside Hawk to catch it.

Moving down toward the other end of the table, Hawk takes
in the surreal surroundings with battle fatigue. He sees
ONE BOARD MEMBER take a luxurious sip of cappuccino.
Minerva paces up upon the table.

                 DARWIN
       Hawkasaurus we got you clothes,
       great hotel, and a 250,000 lira

       That's two hundred dollars a day?
       So he can get a hooker and some

With a yawn, Alfred pulls out a pair of state-of-the-art
handcuffs.

Hawk kicks out at Alfred, who nimbly moves slightly and
gives a pummel to Hawk's body somersaulting him over the
edge of the table, into an empty seat.

       Listen Hawk, this might be difficult

       from the achieving of goals and when
       you make your first billion by the

       You don't speak English? You know,
       you have very beautiful eyes for a
       man.

INT. ENTRANCE CASSETTE ROOM - PHONE

Hawk comes out onto a circular open-air hallway. He
scans up to some rooftops and makes a note...until he
sees a line of International Phone Boothettes. Checking
for Flunkies, he rips one up.

                 HAWK
       Operator, yes, I'm having a wonderful
       buon giorno. I want to make a collect
       call to Tommy 5-Tone Messina, that's
       right, in New York. Stock broker.

The Flunkies drift into view. Hawk hangs up and seethes
off.

Hawk saunters down a long resplendent hallway toward a
room at the end bustling with excitement. Coming to the
mouth of the room, he looks to two gold framed mirrors on
either side of the opening, rubs his head, and scribbles.

                                      50.

Hawk takes in the majestic beauty, and practical details,
of the room--windows, statues, a Massive Ornate Lighting
Fixture--as he moves down one of the twin winding stair-
cases leading to a path of people behind velvet ropes and
the object of their gaze...

THE DA VINCI CODEX

--an old book enclosed in a glass case, propped open to
the familiar BEAUTIFUL DRAWING of a MAN inside a CIRCLE.

                 ANNA
       Here we enter the Da Vinci room.
       Are we all following? Leonardo is
       best known to us as a painter. But
       it is his gift as an inventor who
       drew together science and art that
       is most incredible.

Hawk brightens to the return of Anna, carrying a portfolio
bag, striding down the stairs with a group of INVESTORS
AND FAMILIES.
She brightens back, giving him a quick
verbal breath and a hand squeeze.

                 ANNA
       Tough guy. What are you-- (How's
       your head.) What are you doing here?

                 HAWK
            (vegetable)
       Yes, and my giraffe loves it,
       too... (I heard it was a great place
       to pick up girls.)

She laughs, going into her public voice.

                 ANNA
       As you know, the Da Vinci Codex,
       has lived in the Vatican for
       centuries and will continue to
       live here for centuries more.

                 HAWK
            (under his breath)
       That's what you theenk.

                 ANNA
       Question, sir?....His untiring pen
       predicted the airplane, the
       submarine, the bicycle, the
       helicopter, and even the tank.

A LITTLE BRAT trailing the group, moves next to Hawk,
bitching away to her STUFFED ELEPHANT, POKEY.

       This is so bor-ing! Do you hate
       Italy as much as I do, Pokey?
            (bad ventriloquism)
       Si, senor! Italy sucks the big
       one!
Why can't we go to the Epcot
       Center!

The Little Brat stops and lets Pokey the elephant dangle

                 ANNA
       These more dangerous designs
       inspired him to develop a secret
       code that uh...

The stuffed elephant suddenly goes flying over Anna's
head.

The ALARM goes off. The Massive Ornate Lighting Fixture
swoops down from the ceiling, inverting in air, and slams
down over the Codex, transformed into a makeshift cage.

Strange green gas comes billowing out of the vents.
Needless to say, everyone goes crazy.

Coughing gas, Hawk peeks to see that a line of light
sensor alarms imbedded in the tablets are what set the
alarm off.

Two GAS MASKS drop airlinesquely from the mouth of the
entranceway and TWO RACING-IN GUARDS wrangle them on.

The Little Brat sees that Pokey the stuffed elephant has
been beheaded by the cage/lamp. She is pulled away and
spanked.

                 LITTLE BRAT
       Pokey, come back!

Anna yanks a notetaking Hawk away as the gas blusters in
around him.
The Two Flunkies, eyes on Hawk, are hap-
lessly making their way up the opposite staircase.

                 ANNA
       Come on, this stuff will knock you
       out.
Have you ever had the feeling
       you were being followed, Mr. Bond.

                 HAWK
       Never, why do you ask?

Reaching the top of the stairs, just outside the door,
Anna briskly pulls Hawk into a PIECE OF WALL THAT IS
REALLY A DOOR.

Anna shakes her head as she opens a door into...

A four foot high mail train rumbles down the track of a
mini-underground station. Workers latch onto mail bags.
Hawk and Anna emerge from a small door.

                 HAWK
       The Vatican IRT.

                 ANNA
       The Pope takes his mail very
       seriously. Christmas cards, Easter
       seals, delivers up to ten at night.
       It's actually not such an unusual
       set-up. The secret passageway on
       the other hand... Are you going to
       tell me why you did that, or are
       you going to blame it on Dumbo?

       believe that crazy elephant? The
       Vatican is made of constant
       mysteries meant to be enjoyed,
       not explained.

       sentence. It can apply to people.

                 HAWK
       You're somewhat of a unmysterious
       thang yourself.

             jacket)
       My life's a little boring...

                 HAWK
       Yeah, mine too. Want to have some
       dinner with me tonight? A nice
       dull boring dinner. Scrabble,
       Knock-knock jokes, anecdotes about
       famous dead Italians....

                 ANNA

The Two Flunkies stumble into the station, looking around.
Anna and Hawk crouch down.

       And I'll bring my entourage...

                 ANNA
       Secret passageways don't mean as

Hawk and Anna peck each other with a smile. He crawls
out an exit door. As he leaves, Anna's smile disappears.
She pulls out a rosary and gives herself a self-scolding
bang on the head. She then darts to a large crucifix
and looks up.

                 ANNA
       Father, it's obvious. He's up to

A CARDINAL paces in an enigmatic Vatican area. Anna
clacks up to him.

                 CARDINAL
       Did he mention the Mayflowers?

                 ANNA
       No, your Eminence. He's definitely
       going to steal the Codex. I can
       feel it, I'm not sure when...

                 CARDINAL
       Attempt, to steal you mean. The
       vanity of this man, Hudson Hawk.
       The Vatican has foiled the advances
       of Pirates and Terrorists. We
       will not lie down for some schmuck
       from New Jersey. Must you flirt
       with him so effectively?

                 ANNA
       That's the only way. A wise woman
       once said "Polite conversation is
       rarely either."

                 CARDINAL
            (chuckling)
       Let me be the one to quote
       Scripture. ...As an agent of
       our organization, you are put in
       awkward situations. Just
       remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil,

Hawk grabs up the phone and dials....

       make a long distance collect call
       to New York number... 212 555-1898.

                                      55.

The Mayflower limousine creeps to the edge of the piazza,
behind an oblivious Hawk.

                 HAWK
       What?
Yeah, it's Italy, honey. I
       can barely hear you too. You sound
       like you're under a volcano. What?
       Yes.
Thank you. Buon Giorno to you.

Hawk turns, putting a finger in his ear. Seeing the
limo, he FREAKS and balls himself into a corner.

                 HAWK
       Come on, Tommy, pick up, you
       Reindeer goat cheese-eating

Hawk pokes his head to see a Darwin and Minerva (holding
Bunny) emerge from the limousine. As he turns his concen-

building to cheerfully speak with Darwin and Minerva and
get licked by Bunny, before they all pile into the limo.

                 HAWK
       Tom-my, Tom-my, come on Tommy.

Hawk slams down the phone and turns to see the limousine
pull off.

Hawk angrily bursts from the door and is painfully CLOTHES-
LINED by agent Butterfinger, who is dressed as a mailman.

Crumpled on the ground, Hawk kicks out with his foot, into
Butterfinger's stomach, doubling him. Hawk then grabs him
by the head and rams into the glass of the booth.

Hawk rotates off for an escape...but the rest of the CIA
crew cuts him off holding barely concealed guns; Snickers
dressed as a maitre 'd, Almond Joy as a Bermuda-short
tourist, and Kaplan in his usual emsemble.

Kaplan and the crew quickly disperse in different directions
as Hawk howls in frustration. Kit Kat moves behind Hawk and
perfectly mimics him.

Without looking, Hawk elbows the mimic Kit Kat in the
face.
Kit Kat gives Hawk a strange smile and hands him
a card that reads: BEWARE THE BLUE WIRE.

Hawk looks up from the card. Kit Kat is gone, but
Butterfinger scampers in his place.

where the Codex is bathed in a holy light.

He hefts up the two now frameless mirrors and puts them
each in a groove of a collapsible yardstick running
across the top.
The parallel mirrors now face out from
each other.
Hawk sprays a blast of Clairol to reveal the
light sensor beams, and then with a deep breath, he
thrusts the mirrors into the beams.

The light bounces harmlessly off the mirrors and Hawk
exhales.
He balances the connected mirrors then crawls
through his tent-like passageway.

Hawk squirts acid from a biker's bottle on the cracks of
the rectangular glass case that holds the Codex. The
acid sizzles.

Muttering Italian into his walkie-talkie, Burly Guard
rushes into the room and looks down to the sensor
deflecting mirrors.

Burly Guard approaches the Codex and sees the dripping
acid.
He also notices a fishing hook attached to the
binding of the Codex. The fishing wire leads out of
the glass case.
The Guard reaches to touch it when
suddenly the wire is pulled tightly upward by a
moving-out-from-behind-the-statue Hawk.

He then hurls a softball, smashing a window
on the other side of the room.

The familiar Vatican Guard and a Guard Three barrel

Gas Mask drops from the doorway. The Vatican Guard
pulls it on and gives a "That's Life" shrug of
shoulders to the fainting Guard three.

Hawk puts on the missing gas mask and launches a grapple

Hawk dashes atop a nearby wall and hurls his grapple
across a road around a tree branch. Hawk ties the end of
grapple line, tosses on a friction belt, takes a breath
and JUMPS OFF THE WALL.

Rising up, over the roof, the Vatican Guard aims a gun
at Hawk's sliding away back.

Suddenly, Tommy, in black-cat burglar gear, backhands the
guard across the face, sending him back down the roof.

The gun, bouncing down the front of the roof, goes off...

children.
He slowly spins off the lamppost and sails
down upon...

Panting and discombobulated, Hawk looks across the table

down.
It is Anna. Hawk unpretzels and laps his canvas bag.

                 ANNA
       Oh I was worried you weren't going
       to drop by....

                 HAWK
       Am I late? You look really nice.

       Where did you get the hawk?

                 HAWK
       Ossining, New York.

                 ANNA
       Why do they call you Hudson Hawk?

                 HAWK
       The hawk is a slang word for the
       wind that blows in the winter time.
       I grew up in a town called Hoboken
       in New Jersey. Well, Hoboken is
       on the Hudson River. So, Hudson
       River.

                 ANNA
       Hudson Hawk. So, why did they call
       you Hawk?

                 HAWK
       Anytime anybody needed something stolen
       --needed a favor from me, they'd come to
       me and I'd perform that favor like a
       hawk.
You know, like the wind.

                 ANNA
       Where'd you get these?

                 HAWK
       I had a little accident around
       the house.

       What happened?

                 ANNA

                 HAWK
       I fell on some chickens.

       Does it hurt?

       Yes, it hurts.

                 ANNA

                 HAWK

                 ANNA
       Maybe I can make them better.

                 HAWK
       See what you can do. Don't tickle.
       Don't tickle...

       Come here, I want to tell you
       something. I got to whisper it.

                 ANNA
       I can't do this.

                                      64B.

                 HAWK
       What's the matter?

                 ANNA
       It's been a long time for me.

                 HAWK
       Well, it's been a really long time
       for me. Outside of a friendly dog
       sniffing my genitals yesterday,
       it's been a slow decade.

       I don't make love every ten years,
       I get a little crankly.

       You know, I may have forgotten how
       to kiss girls.

THE CRUCIFIX LIGHTS UP AND BEGINS SHOUTING IN ITALIAN.

                 HAWK

                 ANNA
       Somebody robbed the Vatican.

       Really.

                 HAWK

Anna slides on her shoes and makes a hasty retreat.
She bumps into the canvas bag. The Codex slides out.
They both catch it in mid-air. Anna's eyes pop. She
wrenches the Codex away and kicks. Hawk pulls her into
a compassionate back-against-his-stomach hug. The Codex
falls to the floor unharmed.

                 HAWK
       It's not what you think. Okay,
       maybe it is....

                 ANNA
       You went and did it! You really
       did it! In one day, less than a
       day, of planning, you did it.
       You started the week stealing the
       Sforza and you ended it swiping
       the Codex.

       Yeah, but --

                 HAWK

                 ANNA
       What are your plans for the
       weekend? Hoisting away the
       Colosseum? Hawk, but I... Tell
       me, did the devil make you do it
       or did Darwin and Minerva

                 SNICKERS

Butterfinger pulls up the book on Da Vinci that Anna
wrote and starts reading like a schoolboy.

                 BUTTERFINGER
       "Da Vinci had fears about his
       more dangerous designs, so he

Foam shoots out over the coffee. Hawk smiles down at

                 ANNA
       For two years, I've been tracking
       the Mayflowers' peculiar interest
       in three Da Vinci pieces. Their
       Sforza replica was as fake as
       the "gas leak" that supposedly
       destroyed it.

                 HAWK
       Does everyone in the world know
       more than I do? Jesus, I'm just

       Way to go, Anna.

                 ANNA
       Hudson Hawk had some interesting
       things to say about Darwin, Minerva
       and you. Basically, that you're
       part of the same car pool.

                 KAPLAN
       Anna, Anna, Anna. If this was true,
       Almond Joy would have handed you
       your heart right after you handed
       me the codex. Now the trick is
       this.
As soon as the Mayflowers find
       out that we have the codex, they'll
       want to make a deal, those greedy
       pigs.
So, we'll deal. They buy.
       We bust. Operation Deflower
       Mayflower.

                 ANNA
       What about Hudson Hawk?

                 KAPLAN
       I wouldn't worry about him. He's
       going to be very well taken care
       of.
Now you look tired. Maybe
       you should go back to Rome and get
       some sleep.

       that Operation Deflower Mayflower

Kaplan, Hawk, and the other agents march into the mammoth
room of the opening scene. In the place of where one
remembers the gold machine are undulating sheets, beneath
which are unassembled parts of the machine.

Inside, a ball goes whizzing out of a tennis ball
machine.
In tennis gear and goggles, Darwin Mayflower
thwacks it against the wall of (now faded) frescos.

Also in tennis threads, Minerva is laying on a chaise
lounge, pressing a gadget that causes another ball to
shoot out.
Darwin batters it. The ball richochets
into the forehead of an "amused" Alfred, retrieving
balls in sweat pants.

       Jolly.

                 ALFRED
Good. Shot. Sir.

Hawk reaches for the Codex. Kaplan pulls it over to
Darwin, who slits the binding and tugs out another
geometrically perverted orystal.

                 HAWK
       Another piece of the puzzle for
       the Da Vinci Alchemy project.

Kaplan, Darwin, and Minerva look up to Hawk, then to each
other, all start to speak, then all stop. This quandary
is deferred by the entrance of the twin Flunkies.

       So, sister, what you are saying is
       that Hudson Hawk is not willingly
       working for the Mayflowers but
       Kaplan and the Candy Bars are?

Anna moves out of the confessional curtains, wearing a
FULL NUN HABIT for she is a Nun. The gaspingly beautiful
church unfolds as they walk.

                 ANNA
       You got it. Operation Deflower
       Mayflower is a joke and I'm the
       punchline. I thought we were using
       the CIA to get Mayflower, but really
       the CIA is using me to keep us away
       from Mayflower.

INT. ROME CONFERENCE ROOM--NEXT DAY

Beneath the wacky portrait, Darwin circles the board-
member filled conference table as Minerva smooches Bunny.
Everyone watches Alfred place a bar of Gold and of Lead
in the hands of a blindfolded Hawk at the middle of the M.

                 DARWIN
       So, Captain Hawk, in one of your
       paws you got a gold bar worth
       about 8 thou. In the autre, you
       got lead that won't get you
       gelato.

                 MINERVA
       Surely a master-thief like you can
       tell the difference.

                 HAWK
            ("What's my Line")
       That's one down to Kitty
       Carlisle...

Hawk "weighs" the two bars in his hands--digs with his
fingernails.
He rips off the blindfold in subdued
frustration.

       Cool, isn't it? Weight, feel,
       malleability, they're all but identical.
       On the periodic chart of elements,
       they're but one proton apart. Great

            (casually goosing Alfred)
       Alchemy! Is the business term of
       the 90's, my man! Minerva read
       about it in an airline magazine
       about four years ago. I dumped
       some lira into research...Shazam,
       we come across a diary by one of
       Da Vinci's apprentices detailing
       La Machine de Oro, the gold machine
       for those at home, and the rest is
       about to become history. Money
       isn't everything, gold is. Fuck
       T-bills! (Fuck blue chip stocks!)
       Fuck Junk Bonds! I got the real
       deal!
Money will always be paper
       but gold will always be gold!

                 MINERVA
       A couple of years of steady
       production and we'll flood the
       market with so much gold that gold
       itself, the foundation of all finance,
       will lose its meaning. Brokers,
       economists, and fellow entrepreneurs
       will drown in the saliva of their
       own nervous breakdowns.

                 HAWK
       Sounds like a party. Markets will
       crash-crash. Financial empires
       will crumble-crumble.

                 HAWK
       Except yours-yours. The goal of
       world domination.

                 MINERVA
       In 1992, Europe is coming together
       to become one business superpower.
       It's one party we're going to
       love to poop.

Darwin clicks on the slide machine revealing a drawing of
the helicopter model from the opening scene. He and
Minerva rapid-fire out instructions to a dazed and
nauseous Hawk.

       Well, that said, the last ingredient

Minerva angrily throws the dog off her lap and whips a
tennis ball into its mouth.

                 DARWIN
       I'll torture you so slowly you'll
       think it's a career! I'll kill

Alfred quickly slaps on the state-of-the-art handcuffs
and the blindfold. The viewer's viewpoint stays on a
writhing Hawk.

       I'll kill all you. Even the old
       lady.

Hawk kicks back on the table, "jump ropes" the cuffs,
then picks the lock with his teeth. Hawk rips off the
blindfold to see that the entire room is empty except
for Tommy, standing at the other end, in an incongruous
Italian leather coat.

EXT. FAMILIAR PIAZZA--DAY

The piazza from the fascist E.U.R. building are bustling
with office workers laughing, smoking, and hustling.
Darwin, Minerva and Kaplan are a solid troika in the
center of the steps. The other agents stroll in the
periphery.

                 KAPLAN
       I just don't think it was a
       smoking hot idea to leave them up
       there alone.

                 MINERVA
       Relax George, that's why we put the
       the old pasta slurping guinea on the
       payroll to begin with. To keep Hawk
       in line. They'll talk about "being

            (raising glass)
       You gotta love male bonding.

As Darwin slaps Kaplan on the back, behind them, Hawk and

large M on the stairs.

Flying off the M, moving to the edge of the stairs, Hawk
and Tommy, latter holding his gun, sprout up from their
own debris and continue savagely brawling. The wigging
out passersby give them space.

                 HAWK
       You fucked my freedom for a lousy
       job!

Hawk roars forward like a bull and helmets Tommy. They
roll together down the massive staircase past Darwin,
Minerva, and the CIA who react with "This can't be
happening" catatonia.

Two SHOTS go off as Hawk and Tommy crash to the bottom of
the staircase.
Hawk rises up in a daze to see Tommy on
the ground with two bloody bullet holes.

                 HAWK
             Tommy. No, not like this!
Tommy!
       Tommy!
Ecco! Tommy! Tommy, don't
       go out like this! No! No! Ecco!

Hawk falls to his knees as Snickers hustles toward him.
Suddenly, sirens are heard as a police van pulls up.
Snickers stops.

Four policemen blast from the back of the van. One holds
back the crowd.
One strenuously pulls Hawk into the van.
The other two drag in Tommy.

The villains look to each other for non-existent guidance
as the van pulls away.

They both hop on Vespas and roar off after them.

       Well, guys, on that note, it's
       time for bed.

                 HAWK
       I couldn't agree more. You sleep
       here.

Ignoring the entendre, Anna rises up, closes the
shutters, and turns OFF the MUSIC.

                 ANNA
       I'll get you some sheets.

                 HAWK
            (to Tommy)
       Yeah, let's get you some sheets.

Hawk leaps up and moves toward Anna and her bed.

                 HAWK
       It's a very special night...

       Yes, it was...

       Is...

                 ANNA

                 HAWK

Hawk moves in for a tender kiss. Anna pecks him.

                 ANNA
       Was.
There's things you don't
       know about me.

                 HAWK
       There's things I do know about you.
       And about me. And about that bed.

Anna warmly laughs, dumping two pillows and two sets of
sheets into his outstretched-for-a-hug arms. Tommy is
poking his head over the couch in the background, holding
in his laughter.

                 ANNA
       This is not the time, Hudson.

                 HAWK
       Don't call me Hudson.
            (looking off in
             exasperation)
       Can't we just have a late night
       cappuccino?

                 ANNA
       I'm sorry, the machine's still
       set up for poisonous foam.

                 HAWK
       Oh yeah, I remember.

       Good night.

                 TOMMY

       It's a very special night.

                 HAWK
            (smiling)
       That's it. Hit the floor. If I'm
       getting no cappuccino and I ain't
       getting no trim, I'm at least taking
       the couch.

Hawk flops on the couch and puts his head on a pillow.

INT. ANNA'S APARTMENT - NEXT DAY

Sunlight through the shutters hits Hawk's now-smiling
face as it rests, unmoved, on the pillow. Into this
happy image comes Snickers' electric catle prod. It
zaps Hawk awake.

With a howl, he spins up on the couch to see behind him
Kaplan and the rest of the Candy Bars, except for Kit
Kat.
All are laughing in amusingly casual clothing --
T-shirts, tank tops, turned-the-other-way baseball caps.
They have an eerie fraternity on spring break ambience.
Butterfinger even has a cooler of brewskis.

                 KAPLAN
       The license plate on the police
       van had a Vatican prefix, I'm
       losing respect for you guys.
       You were that close, buddy, to
       getting away with this crap.

Tommy's snoring from the floor becomes apparent. Hawk
kicks him.
He whinnies in irritation, then finally
awakens to take in the situation.

       What's...

       Where's Anna?

                 TOMMY

                 KAPLAN

                 HAWK

       hour, we'll grab a shower, pick up
       some croissants and shit...

                 KAPLAN
       You know, I really wish I could
       come up with glib repartee the way
       you guys can, but I can't, so I'll
       just paralyze you. A.J.?

                 ALMOND JOY
       Curari darts. When it comes to
       instantaneous loss of all physical
       control below your neck, I can't
       recommend them more highly.

As she speaks, Almond Joy saunters forth, putting a
small, classy blow gun in her mouth like a cigarette.
She flicks open a cigarette case, revealing blow darts.
She blows one into Hawk's neck. He splays into a
jellified sitting position. Tommy leaps up only to get
one in the chest. He crumples next to Hawk on the couch.

Snickers joins Almond Joy to maneuver their paralyzed
bodies into identical one-arm-over-the-couch-legs-
crossed-effeminately position. The vivid heads of Hawk
and Tommy amusingly bark out in helplessness.

                 TOMMY
       I'll bite your tongues out.

                 HAWK/TOMMY
       We're going to kill you! We're
       going to rip your lungs out!

                 HAWK
       Let me get my teeth at you!

                 TOMMY
       Come on, you chicken shit sons and
       daughters of bitches, my head
       against your heads. Fair fight --

                 HAWK
       This is how I go out! Like a hunk of
       fucking Play-Doh! Like some Gumby
       in a store...

The Candy Bars laugh even more. Rambunctiously,
Butterfinger dribbles his beer.

                 HAWK
       Keep laughing, Jumbo.

                 KAPLAN
       Hawk, the Louvre is yesterday's
       news, or should I say this
       morning's...

Kit Kat suddenly emerges from the chimney in a Santa out-
fit, holding a bag of goodies. He flips out a newspaper.
"LOUVRE ATTACKED -- Billions in Artwork Destroyed, Guards
Slaughtered, Da Vinci Model Missing." The Candy Bars
cheer and hoot.

                 SNICKERS
       I admit we displayed a lack of
       nuance, didn't wear black, didn't
       sing 'Swinging On a Star.' It
       hurts me to think that if we
       showed Butterfinger which way to
       point a bazooka, the Mona Lisa
       might still have a head.

Guilty chuckles. Almond Joy playfully musses up a
sheepishly-smiling Butterfinger's hair.

                 KAPLAN
       But we weren't being graded for
       neatness, only results.

To the sound of the holy DA VINCI THEME, Kaplan pulls out
the Da Vinci helicopter model from Kit Kat's bag of
goodies.

                 TOMMY
            (still looking at
             the newspaper)
       Damnit, Yanks lose again.

                 HAWK
       How'd the Mets do? Could you
       turn to Section D?

Butterfinger tips the couch forward, sending our smart-
ass heroes to thud on their backs on the floor. Kaplan
menacingly hovers over them.

                 KAPLAN
       You guys still might be the
       fairest cat burglars of them all.
       Maybe if you weren't such snobs,
       some innocent guards would still
       be alive. It's irrelevant now.
       You're irrelevant now.

Kaplan flicks a switchblade and cuts into the bottom of
the helicopter model, unleashing the small, intricate
mirror from the opening.

       Tonight, in the castle at Vinci,
       we make gold.

                 SNICKERS
       Next month, in Tokyo, London,
       Paris, and Moscow, we make
       financial chaos. This is no joke.

                 KAPLAN
       But this is -- 'Mrs Hawkins, can
       Eddie come out and play baseball?'
       'But don't you kids know Eddie is
       paralyzed from the neck down?' 'Yeah,
       we want him to be third base.'

Suddenly, Anna la-de-dahs into the apartment, hefting up
two big grocery bags.

                 ANNA
       Rise and shine, sleepy heads.

       Hi, Anna.

                 HANK & TOMMY

       Hi, Anna.

                 ANNA
            (panicked, backing up)

Anna suddenly pulls a gun and some handcuffs from a
drawer; her voice turning hard and collected. She points
the gun directly at George. His face drops.

                 ANNA
       ... don't be foolish, Mr. Kaplan,
       this Bud's for you, why don't you
       give me that crystal?

Anna flings the cuffs at Kaplan's feet. He smiles. The
other Candy Bars smile. Almond Joy calmly felines
forward, maneuvering out her blow gun and blow darts.
Anna swerves the gun toward her.

                 ALMOND JOY
       Anna-Bannana-Fo-Fanna, you're not
       going to shoot little old me,
       you're not oging to shoot little
       old anybody, I read your dossier,
       sister.

Almond Joy blows a dart into Anna's throat. She convulses
forward, pirouetting to the ground right next to Hawk.

                 HAWK
       Why didn't you shoot?

                 ANNA
       I'm sorry Hudson

                 HAWK
       Don't call me Hudson. I told you
       only the nuns call me -- why did
       she call you sister?

                 ANNA
       I'm sorry, Hudson, I really meant
       to tell you...

The Candy Bars raucously laugh. Kit Kat holds up a card
that says RAUCOUS LAUGHTER.

                 SNICKERS
       He didn't know?

                 ALMOND JOY
       He didn't know?

                 BUTTERFINGER
       Ah, Hawk likes a nun!

Snickers and Butterfinger pull out habits from a nearby
drawer dancing with them. Biting his lip off, Tommy
painfully whimpers, trying to hold in his own laughter.

                 HAWK
       Those better be tears you're
       crying, Tommy.

                 ANNA
       It doesn't mean I don't love you.

It's your job to love me.
       You probably love Butterfingers.

                 ANNA
       Uh, well, yeah, in a weird Catholic
       way I do, but you... you.

They try to stretch their heads forward for a kiss. Their
lips almost touch, until Butterfinger pulls Anna up and
flops her over his shoulder.

                 KAPLAN
       Miss Baralgi's Da Vinci expertise
       allows her to go to the next
       course. As for you... a souvenir.

Kaplan tosses the empty Da Vinci model on the floor.

                 KAPLAN
       You know, Hawk, I'd like to think
       in a way, we did this job together.
       In another life, we could have been
       friends. But I fear not in this one.
       You're about to find out. Ciao.

Kaplan turns to depart with Kit Kat and the Anna-toting
Butterfinger.
Anna's upside-down head speaks.

       Later, guys.

                 ANNA

                 TOMMY
       Easy for you to say.

Snickers takes the bag of goodies from an exiting Kit Kat
and moves forward along with Almond Joy.

                 SNICKERS
       Boys, we got some good news and
       some bad news.

                 ALMOND JOY
       The good news is that you'll be
       completely unparalyzed in two
       minutes.

                 SNICKERS
       The bad news is that that gives
       you only five seconds to defuse
       the bombs.

       Bombs?

Snickers and Almond Joy snicker and pull out rifles that
have time bombs attached to them. Almond Joy fires hers
upward.
The bomb launches from the rifle and suctions
atop the ceiling. It reads 2:05...2:04.

Hawk and Tommy moan and "oh-oh-oh" up at the bomb. Hawk
manages to move one of his legs feebly upward. Tommy
manages to move one of his arms feebly upward. Snickers
and Almond Joy are totally entertained.

                 SNICKERS
       I'm glad it has to be like this.
       I'll shoot mine in the kitchen.

Snickers hefts up his rifle and turns toward the kitchen
when suddenly, with his alive leg, Hawk boots Snickers in
the genitals.
His rifle falls into Tommy's alive hand.
He shoots the bomb into Snickers' head. Wearily
unparalyzing, Tommy then tips over, grabs Anna handcuffs
and attaches Snickers' leg to the couch.

                 SNICKERS
       Almond Joy, more paralysis!

Almond Joy fumbles with her blow gun and her curari blow
darts.
She gets one in the gun when Hawk stiffly roars
up from the dead, grabs her by the shoulders, and wraps
his lips around the other end of the blow gun. He
shotguns the dart into her mouth. She crumples onto the
couch, dead from the neck down.

                 ALMOND JOY
       This is what I get for darting a
       nun.

Like the living dead, Hawk and Tommy start to shuffle
away.
Snickers tries to pull off the bomb as it, and its
brother on the ceiling, go: 00:59...00:58...

       You can move?

       Yeah.

EXT. BENEATH A CASTLE TURRET - DUSK

Hawk and Tommy rumble around a castle turret. They stop
next to a drainpipe to pant. Tommy is carrying the golf

       Anna, Hawkmeister, you're probably
       wondering why you're still alive.
       We didn't want you to go to Hell
       without knowing our dream came true.
       But we still are having some trouble
       putting that damn crystal together.
       Alfie and I've been going at that
       thing all night.

       Well, put it together.

       Fuck you.

                 HAWK

       Of course, Alfred does have a point.

       Don't do it Hudson.

       Hay, what did I tell you about calling

       If you pull this off, I can't promise
       that I won't kill you. I mean, who

       Why is the world so jam packed with
       such idiots. Every shmoe has the
       fantasy that the planet revolves
       around them. It rains, car crash
       stops traffic, you say, "How could
       this happen to me?" It's a natural
       inclination. But for I; this isn't
       a fantasy, it is reality. You are
       on my planet! You walk around the
       corner for coffee, out of my sight,
       you do not fucking exist! The lives
       of shmoes like you have meaning only
       in relation to the rich, to the

Da Vinci had it in his machine.

Using a long steel pole, Technician One adjusts a
myraid of mirrors so they are in a proper angle with
a series of lenses culminating on the top of the
machine.

Technicians Two (black-eyed) and Three pour various
chemical powders and liquids into corresponding
compartments on the machine, beautifully decorated
by the chemical's zodiac sign.

Darwin places a lead bar in its proper place.

Hawk glides to Anna and undoes her handcuff.

Alfred rushes forward with a howl. Hawk meets him

Hawk fires in some gut punches while
dodging the blade.

for forgiveness. She aims steadily, and fires...

She fires again. The bullet pings off Hawk's belt
buckle.

Hawk's turning to chastise Anna, allows Alfred to kick
Hawk back against a wall. Alfred lunges out with his
blade, hitting the wall off-angle. Hawk yanks the shaft.
Alfred goes with the flow and presses the shaft on Hawk's
throat.

Gasping, Hawk looks to a rip in Alfred's shirt and sees
a hinge and lever on the shaft. With an all or nothing
jerk, Hawk flicks the lever. The shaft clicks on the
hinge.

Alfred's greater strength and narrower grip makes it
fold away from Hawk and suddenly it is Alfred's throat
which is caught in the V-shaped trap! The momentum of

wall until the point of the "V" hits it --
