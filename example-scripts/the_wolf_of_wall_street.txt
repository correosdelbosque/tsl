INSERT - TV COMMERCIAL - DAY  

Over jungle sound effects, the CAMERA is low, moving 
through brush from the POV of a stalking animal.  As the 
brush parts, revealing Wall Street and the New York Stock 
Exchange, we HEAR the resonant voice of GENE HACKMAN.    

                 GENE HACKMAN 
       The world of investing can be a 
       jungle.  

WE SEE a charging, snorting BULL.

       Bulls.  

                 GENE HACKMAN 

WE SEE a ferocious, growling BEAR.

                 GENE HACKMAN 
       Bears.  Danger at every turn.      

Pretentious CLASSICAL MUSIC kicks in.   

                 GENE HACKMAN 
       Thats why we at Stratton Oakmont 
       pride ourselves on being the best.   

VARIOUS SHOTS -- a conservative young MAN reviews a stock 
portfolio with a wealthy older COUPLE; a smiling young 
WOMAN sits before a computer talking into a headset.


                 GENE HACKMAN 
       Trained professionals to guide you 
       through the financial wilderness.  

WE SEE the Stratton team - an ethnically diverse group 
of ACTORS with their handsome, grey-templed CHAIRMAN.        

                 GENE HACKMAN 
       Stratton Oakmont.  Stabilty.  
       Integrity.  Pride. 

WE SEE a shot of the black glass Stratton Building, and: 

INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - BULLPEN - DAY  (FEB 95)

Absolute bedlam.  300 drunken STOCKBROKERS, most in their 
early 20s, chant wildly as JORDAN BELFORT, handsome, 30, 
stands beside a DWARF dressed in tights, cape & helmet.


                 JORDAN
       Twenty five grand to the first 
       cocksucker to nail a bullseye!  

The bullseye is a large dollar sign in the middle of a 
giant velcro dartboard.  

                 JORDAN 
       Watch and learn, people!

The Brokers go apeshit as Jordan grabs the Dwarf by his 
pants and collar.  In the Crowd, cash flies as side bets 
are made.  Jordan winds up, aims for the dartboard.   

                 JORDAN 
       One.  Two.  Throw!!

The Brokers cheer, and as the screaming Dwarf takes 
flight, hurtling toward camera, we FREEZE FRAME:

                 JORDAN  
       My name is Jordan Belfort. No, not 
       him, me. Im a former member of 
       the middle class raised by two 
       accountants in a tiny apartment in 
       Bayside, Queens.  

A SERIES OF POLAROIDS -- (1969)

Jordan, 7, smiles as he poses behind a lemonade stand, 
his parents Max and Leah behind him; Jordan, 13, stands 
holding a styrofoam cooler, selling ices on the beach; 
Jordan, 18, smiles as he holds an Amway sales brochure.  

                 JORDAN  
       The year I turned 26, I made 49 
       million dollars as the head of   
       my own brokerage firm--

EXT. LONG ISLAND EXPRESSWAY - DAY  (FEB 95)

A CHERRY RED Ferrari Testarossa ZOOMS down the L.I.E.

                 JORDAN 
       --which really pissed me off 
       because it was three shy of a 
       million a week.

The Ferrari weaves in and out of traffic. 

                 JORDAN 
       Hey, my Ferrari was white, like 
       Don Johnsons in Miami Vice.

We see the same Ferrari, now in WHITE, as it zooms away, 
a BLONDE head bobbing up and down in Jordans lap. 

EXT. LONG ISLANDS NORTH SHORE - DAY   (FEB 95)

A twin-engine Bell Jet helicopter descends over a huge 
mansion, with sparkling pool, tennis court and waterfall.

                 JORDAN  
       See that humongous estate down 
       there?  Thats my house.   

INT. JORDANS ESTATE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY  (FEB 95)

We see NAOMI, 24, blonde and gorgeous, a living wet dream 
in LaPerla lingerie.

                 JORDAN 
       My wife, Naomi, the Duchess of Bay 
       Ridge, Brooklyn, a former model 
       and Miller Lite girl.

Naomi licks her lips; shes incredibly, painfully hot.  

                 JORDAN 
       Yeah, she was the one blowing me 
       in the Ferrari, so put your dick 
       back in your pants.     

Over the following, WE SEE a quick SERIES OF SHOTS


All taken from TV; a mansion from Lifestyles of the Rich 
and Famous; wealthy PEOPLE applauding at a polo match;   
a yacht sailing crystal blue seas; Robert Wagner and 
Stephanie Powers toasting with champagne on Hart to Hart.

                 JORDAN 
       In addition to Naomi and my two 
       perfect kids, I own a mansion,    
       private jet, six cars, three 
       horses, two vacation homes and    
       a 170 foot yacht. 

INT. HOTEL BEDROOM - NIGHT (FEB 95)


Sweaty, wild-eyed and naked, Jordan fucks an HISPANIC 
HOOKER from behind.  

                 JORDAN  
       I also gamble like a degenerate, 
       drink like a fish, fuck hookers 
       maybe five times a week and have 
       three different Federal agencies 
       looking to indict me.  

He dismounts, snorts some coke through a straw, then uses 
it to blow some into her asshole.  

                 JORDAN 
       Oh yeah, and I love drugs. 

Jordan looks up suddenly, paranoid, as if hes hearing 
voices. 


INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT  (FEB 95)

Jordan, drooling and stoned out of his skull, wears a 
rumpled custom-made business suit as he mans a set of 
controls next to his frantic co-pilot, CAPTAIN DAVE.

                 CAPTAIN DAVE
       Pull up!  Jesus!  Were gonna 
       crash!!

Jordans head bobs as he pulls back on the stick.      
The helicopter rises sharply, then levels out, hovering     
30 feet above a huge mansion.  Down below, through 
Jordans hazy, DOUBLE VISIONED POV, we see a sparkling 
pool, tennis court and waterfall. 

                 JORDAN 
       Check this out -- despite my 
       completely fucked-up state, I 
       could fly straight while still 
       seeing two of everything.

He closes one eye; his POV sharpens.  Putting pressure on 
the stick, the helicopter descends slowly over the 
driving range... then LURCHES and SLAMS to the ground. 

                 JORDAN
           (to Captain Dave)
       Ya guzza git hazarous doozy pay, 
       buddy.   


INT. JORDANS ESTATE - FRONT DOOR - DAY  (FEB 95)


Morning.  Sober now, impeccable in suit and tie, Jordan 
heads for the door holding a glass of orange juice.

                 JORDAN  
       Yes, on a daily basis I take 
       enough drugs to sedate greater 
       Long Island. 


EXT. JORDANS ESTATE - CONTINUOUS  (FEB 95)

He pops two white pills, swigs some juice, then speaks 
directly to the camera as he heads for a waiting limo.

                 JORDAN
       I take Quaaludes for my back, 
       fifteen to twenty a day.  


                 JORDAN 
       I use Xanax to stay focused, 
       ambien to sleep, pot to mellow 
       out, cocaine to wake up and 
       morphine because its awesome. 


EXT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - LONG ISLAND - DAY  (FEB 95)


The limo pulls up to the black glass office building.  
Jordan gets out, heads inside through a back door.   

                 JORDAN 
       But of all the drugs under Gods 
       blue heaven, theres one thats my 
       absolute favorite.

INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - JORDANS OFFICE - DAY (FEB 95)

Gadgets, computers, oxblood leather furniture.  With   
the DIN of the brokerage firm bleeding in, Jordan uses   
a credit card to cut a line of coke on his desk.  As he 
peels a crisp $100 DOLLAR BILL off a wad, rolls it up:

                 JORDAN 
       Enough of this shitll make you 
       invincible, able to conquer the 
       world and eviscerate your enemies.  

He SNARFS up the line, gestures to the cocaine.    

                 JORDAN 
       Im not talking about this.  Im 
       talking about this.
           (Jordan unfurls the 
            $100 with a SNAP)
       Money is the oxygen of capitalism 
       and I wanna breathe more than any 
       other human being alive.

He crumbles it into a ball and tosses it into a corner, 
where it comes to rest with two dozen others.  Over his 
back as we TRACK HIM out of his office toward what sounds 
like the ROAR of a mob--

                 JORDAN 
       Money doesnt just buy you a 
       better life -- better food, better 
       cars, better pussy -- it also 
       makes you a better person.  You 
       can give generously to the church 
       of your choice or the political 
       party.  You can save the fucking 
       spotted owl with money.

INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - BULLPEN - DAY   (FEB 95)

Arms akimbo, Jordan stands above the bullpen, a huge open 
space with tightly packed rows of maple colored desks.  

                 JORDAN 
       But most of all, in any country in 
       the world, money can buy you love.  
       Fuck the Beatles.

His 300 BROKERS, mostly young men with their jackets off, 
scream wildly.  They worship him.      

                 JORDAN 
       With that in mind, at the tender 
       age of 22, after marrying my 
       girlfriend Teresa--

EXT. WALL STREET - DAY  (MAY 87)

An express bus pull up -- its sign reads Wall 
Street....  

                 JORDAN 
       --I headed to the only place that   
       befit my high-minded ambitions...

Jordan emerges, kisses TERESA goodbye, then joins a sea 
of Commuters heading to work.  

                 JERRY FOGEL (PRE-LAP)
       You are lower than fucking pond 
       scum.

INT. L.F. ROTHSCHILD - BULLPEN - DAY  (MAY 87)


Computers, telephones everywhere.  At their desks, 45 
shirt-sleeved BROKERS read their Wall St. Journals,  
readying for war.  Like an eager puppy, Jordan follows 
broker JERRY FOGEL, 30, thick-lipped and bow-tied...  

                 JERRY FOGEL
       You got a problem with that?
           (reads name tag)
       Jordan?

                 JORDAN
       Nope.  No problem at all. 

                 JERRY FOGEL  
       Your job is connector, which 
       means you'll be dialing the phone 
       over 500 times a day, trying to 
       connect me with business owners.  
       And till you pass your Series 7, 
       thats all youll be doing.  Sit.

Jordan takes a seat at the desk next to Fogels.   

                 JERRY FOGEL 
       Just so you know, last year I made 
       over 300k and the other guy you'll 
       be working for made a million.

                 JORDAN 
       A million dollars?  I could only 
       imagine what a douchebag that guy 
       must be.

A manicured hand lands on Jordans shoulder.  Its MARK  
HANNA, 30s, charismatic, movie-star handsome. 

                 MARK HANNA
       Jordan?  Mark Hanna.  
           (re: Fogel)
       Good, youve met Jerry.  One of 
       the smartest guys in the office.  
       Whos ever sucked a dogs cock out 
       of loneliness.

Fogels smile turns to a frown.  He hands Jordan a stack 
of 3x5 index cards.

                 JERRY FOGEL
       Smile and dial.  And dont pick 
       your fucking head up till one.

                 MARK HANNA 
       Dont mind Jerry, his father raped 
       him as a child.  Besides, I'm 
       senior broker here, he's a 
       worthless piker.  I heard you 
       pitched stock at your job 
       interview.

                 JORDAN
       Had to do something to stand out.

                 MARK HANNA
       I fuckin love that!  Lets grab 
       lunch later.  Windows good with 
       you?



                 JORDAN
       Great.  Yeah.

Hanna gives him a wink, looks at the clock on the giant 
electronic stock ticker encircling the room -- 9:30 a.m.    

                 MARK HANNA
       Lets fuck!!

RING!!!  Absolute pandemonium at the BELL signalling the 
opening of the stock market.  Feet fly off desks; Brokers 
and their Connectors dial phones like mad.  The CAMERA 
PUSHES IN on JORDAN, mesmerized as he takes in the ROAR.  

                 BROKER #1
           (to Broker #2)
       Miniscribe's a fuckin steal!  
       Thirty eight bucks a share!

                 MARK HANNA
           (into headset)
       Your broker in West Virginia?  
       What are you buying, a coal mine?  
       It's the 80s, the game is high-
       tech.

                 BROKER #2
           (to Broker #3)
       Fuckface!  I got 50,000 July 50s! 

                 JORDAN 
       You want to know what money sounds 
       like?  Visit a trading floor on 
       Wall Street.  Fuck this, shit 
       that.  Cock, cunt, asshole.  I 
       couldnt believe how these guys 
       talked to each other--

Fogel notices Jordan sitting there frozen.  He covers his 
mouthpiece, kicks the desk violently.

                 JERRY FOGEL 
       Dial the cocksucking phone!

Jordan snaps out of it, starts dialing.

                 JORDAN 
       I was hooked within seconds.    

Mark Hanna slams down his phone in victory, scrawls out a 
buy ticket.  He places the ticket into a glass cylinder 
which he slips into a plastic pneumatic tube.

                 JORDAN 
       It was like mainlining adrenaline. 

The tube is WHOOSHED into the ceiling and were suddenly-- 

INT. WINDOWS ON THE WORLD - DAY  (MAY 87)

CLOSE ON a COKE SPOON whose contents disappear up a 
nostril.  PULL BACK TO REVEAL...

The lunchtime power spot with panoramic views of the 
city.  At a corner table, a paranoid Jordan looks around 
as Hanna does another bump of coke.  None of the other 
DINERS seem to notice or care.

                 MARK HANNA
           (offering the spoon)
       Got enough for one more?  Tootski?

                 JORDAN
       No.  Thanks though.

Hanna slips the vial into his pocket as HECTOR, the 
tuxedoed MaitreD, approaches.

                 HECTOR
       Mr. Hanna, what can I bring for 
       you on this glorious afternoon?

Hanna surreptitiously palms Hector a $100; Jordan 
notices. 

                 MARK HANNA 
       Heres the game plan, Hector. 
       Bring  us two Absolut Martinis 
       straight up.  Precisely seven and 
       a half minutes after you deliver 
       those youll bring two more, then 
       two more every five minutes until 
       one of us passes out.

                 HECTOR
       An excellent strategy, sir. 

                 JORDAN
       Actually, Im good with 7-Up.

Jordan might as well have farted at the table.

                 MARK HANNA
       First day on Wall Street, Hector.     
       Give him time.
           (Hector offers menus)
       No thanks, Im not eating.

Hector heads off.

                 JORDAN 
       You can get high during the day 
       and still function?  

                 MARK HANNA
       High is the only way to do this 
       fucking job.  Guy who coined the 
       term three-martini lunch was a 
       woman.  Cocaine and hookers, my 
       friend, the keys to success.  

Jordan smiles, not sure if Hanna is kidding.  

                 JORDAN
       I gotta say, Im really excited 
       about being part of your team.    
       I wanna do all I can for our 
       clients and -- 

                 MARK HANNA
           (reciting an ad)
       Here at L.F. Rothschild, our 
       clients arent just important, 
       theyre family.  Just as long as 
       we get our taste first.  Remember 
       something, Jordan, your top 
       priority in this job: make us 
       money.  If the clients get rich 
       along the way, bully for them.  
       Got a girlfriend?

                 JORDAN
       Wife.  She cuts hair.

Mark swallows a comment about that.  Gets to business.

                 MARK HANNA
       OK, first rule of Wall Street.  
       Nobody -- and I dont care if 
       youre Warren Buffet or Jimmy 
       Buffet -- nobody knows if a 
       stocks going up, down or fucking 
       sideways, least of all stock 
       brokers.  But we have to pretend 
       we know.  Make sure you stay 
       relaxed.  Nobody wants to buy 
       something from someone who sounds 
       like they havent gotten laid in a 
       month.  Take breaks when you feel 
       stressed, jerk off if you can.  
       You like jerking  off, right?



                 JORDAN
       Well... sure.

                 MARK HANNA
       Good, jerking off is key.  And I 
       highly recommend cocaine, which 
       will make you dial faster, which 
       is good for me.  Churn em and 
       burn em, baby.


A BUSBOY stops by with a fresh napkin for Mark who thanks 
him.  Then, discreetly as possible, Mark removes a fresh 
vial of cocaine tucked within and takes a quick snort.  
Jordan realizes: thats why he palmed the maitre d $100.

                 JORDAN  
       For the next six months I learned 
       the ways of Wall Street.


INT. STRIP CLUB - NIGHT  (OCT 87)

As STRIPPERS grind in b.g, Jordan parties with Mark Hanna 
and dozens of BROKERS and TRAINEES.  Jordan sips a 
martini and studies Mark Hanna, hitting on a STRIPPER.

                 JORDAN  
       That fall I passed my Series 7.  
       Finally it was here.  

INT. ROTHSCHILD BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY  (OCT 87)

Briefcase in hand, Jordan boards the elevator with a 
dozen other BROKERS.  

                 JORDAN 
       My first day as a stockbroker, a 
       future Master of the Universe.

And as the doors close, on screen WE SEE: OCTOBER 19th, 1987

INT. L.F. ROTHSCHILD - BULLPEN - DAY  (OCT 87)

Total chaos.  Jordan dials the phone as all around him 
Brokers panic, screaming into headsets.

                 JORDAN 
       They called it Black Monday.
       By four p.m. the market was down 
       508 points, the biggest one-day 
       drop since the crash of 29. 

4 p.m.  The closing bell RINGS; the entire place goes 
silent.  Brokers look at each other, stunned.

                 MARK HANNA
       Holy.  Fucking.  Shit. 

And as the Brokers start commiserating with each other...

                 JORDAN 
       L.F. Rothschild, a company that 
       had been in business since 1883, 
       closed its doors within a month.

INT. JORDAN & TERESAS APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY (DEC 87)      

Jordan sits at the table perusing the Times classifieds.  
Teresa approaches with two coffees.  Sits next to him.

                 TERESA
       So Ill take an extra shift, dont 
       worry about it.  

                 JORDAN
       You work too much as it is. 

                 TERESA
       We could pawn my engagement ring.

                 JORDAN 
       Were not pawning anything.  Im 
       gonna be a millionaire, Teresa.    

                 TERESA
       You know that doesnt matter, 
       right?

He smiles, kisses her.  Together, they peruse the ads. 

                 JORDAN 
           (points to an ad)
       Nobody Beats the Wiz.  I could 
       be a stock boy. 

                 TERESA
       Youre a stock broker.

                 JORDAN 
       No ones hiring brokers right now, 
       sweetie.

They go back to the ads.  After a few beats, she points--

                 TERESA 
       This place is.

EXT. STRIP MALL - PARKING LOT - LONG ISLAND - DAY (DEC 87) 


In a suit, Jordan emerges from an 85 Datsun.  He looks 
around confused, heads toward an unmarked storefront.

INT. INVESTORS CENTER - DAY  (DEC 87)

The antithesis of L.F. Rothschild, with cheap furniture 
and a dozen misfit BROKERS giving loud, obnoxious sales 
pitches.  Jordan enters, a modern man among cave people.  
DWAYNE, slovenly, 35, with a walrus mustache, looks up.

                 JORDAN
       Im looking for Investors Center?

                 DWAYNE
       Thats us, hey.  Dwayne.

                 JORDAN
           (as they shake hands)
       Jordan Belfort, I called earlier.  
       I was a broker with Rothschild.  

Dwayne motions Jordan to a seat.  Nearby, a Broker in 
ratty Keds, TOBY WELCH, is screaming into his phone.  

                 TOBY WELCH
       Im tellin you, this stock is 
       goin up!...  Cause I know, 
       okay?!...  I have inside 
       information!

Jordan looks at him, appalled at what hes hearing.

                 JORDAN 
       Where are your quotrons?

                 DWAYNE
       No quotrons, we sell off the pink 
       sheets -- penny stocks.

Dwayne slides Jordan a large thin book; its pages are 
literally pink.  He explains as Jordan flips the pages:

                 DWAYNE 
       Company dont have enough capital 
       to be listed on NASDAQ, their 
       shares trade here.  
           (points to the book)
       Like these guys, Aerotyne?  They 
       make radar detectors out of a 
       garage in Dubuque.  

                 JORDAN
       Six cents a share?  Who buys this 
       crap?

                 DWAYNE 
       Schmucks mostly.  Mailmen, 
       plumbers, people thinking they can 
       get rich quick.  They answer our 
       ads, Popular Mechanics, Hustler.       


                 JORDAN
       The spread on these is huge.

                 DWAYNE 
       Sos your commission, thats the 
       point.  Blue chips stocks you get 
       what, one percent?  Pink sheets 
       are fifty. 

                 JORDAN
       Wait a second.  Youre telling me 
       if I sell two thousand dollars 
       worth of stock, my commission is a 
       thousand bucks?   

                 DWAYNE 
       Technically, yeah, but not even 
       the biggest schmuck buys two 
       thousand dollars of this shit.


INT. INVESTORS CENTER - (LATER THAT) DAY  (DEC 87)

As others Brokers bark into phones, Jordan sits, phone 
cradled in his shoulder, making notes. A few beats, then:

                 JORDAN
           (into phone)
       Mr. Fleming, good morning, Jordan 
       Belfort with Investors Center in 
       New York City.  You recently 
       responded to one of our ads...  

A few of the other Brokers glance over, eavesdropping.  

                 JORDAN 
       The reason Im calling is that   
       an extremely exciting investment 
       opportunity crossed my desk today.  
       Typically our firm recommends no 
       more than five stocks per year: 
       this is one of them...  

A few more Brokers look over...

                 JORDAN 
       Aerotyne International is a 
       cutting edge tech firm out of the 
       Midwest, awaiting imminent patent 
       approval on a new generation of 
       radar equipment...

LATER.  Now all the Brokers listen in rapt attention.


                 JORDAN 
       -- so if Aerotynes shares rise    
       to only a dollar -- and our 
       research indicates they could go  
       much, much higher -- your profit 
       on a mere three thousand dollar 
       investment would be upwards of 
       fifty thousand...  Thats right, 
       you could pay off your mortgage.  

Seconds tick by; an eternity, then he starts writing:

                 JORDAN 
       Four thousand dollars, will    
       that be check or money order?...     
       Thank you, sir.

Jordan hangs up, scrawls out a buy ticket.

                 JORDAN   
       Just like that I made two grand.    
       The other guys looked at me like 
       Id just discovered fire. 

Toby Welch and the other cave-Brokers stare at him. 

                 TOBY WELCH
       Howd you fuckin do that?

INT. INVESTORS CENTER - (ANOTHER) DAY (FEB 88)

Jordan sits at his desk in mid-pitch, totally focused.   

                 JORDAN 
       Its a rock-solid company, sir, 
       its the next Microsoft...      
       Six thousand.  Terrific.

As Jordan continues talking, wrapping up the sale...

                 JORDAN  
       Though I knew I was selling 
       garbage, within twelve weeks I  
       was making a fortune.

And as he starts scrawling out a buy ticket...

                 JORDAN 
       And as a wise man once told me,  
       my only responsibility was to   
       put meat on the table.   

CLOSE ON a 1988 Jaguar, parked outside a diner...


INT. KACANDES DINER - BAYSIDE - DAY  (JUN 88)

Wearing a suit, Jordan sits in a booth reading the  Wall 
Street Journal as a WAITRESS serves the food.  DONNIE 
AZOFF, preppy-looking, 25, with horn-rims and bright 
white teeth approaches from the takeout counter.  

                 DONNIE 
       That your Jag in the lot?  


                 JORDAN
       Yeah.  

                 DONNIE 
       Nice ride.  Donnie Azoff.

                 JORDAN
       Jordan Belfort.

                 DONNIE 
       Ive seen it around.  We live in 
       the same building.  Twelfth floor?  
           (Jordan nods)
       What do you do, bro?

                 JORDAN 
       Stock broker.  

                 DONNIE 
       Kids furniture, me and my brother- 
       in-law.  Making any money?  

                 JORDAN
       Seventy grand last month.

                 DONNIE 
       Get the fuck out.  You made 
       seventy grand in one month.

                 JORDAN
       Seventy two actually.

Donnie studies him, isnt sure if hes full of shit.

                 DONNIE 
       Tell you what.  You show me a pay 
       stub with $72,000 on it, Im 
       quitting my job right now and 
       coming to work with you. 

As Jordan retrieves his briefcase to find a paystub --  

As Jordan hands Donnie his paystub and sure enough, its 
north of seventy-two k.

                 DONNIE 
       Holy shit. 

Jordan watches as Donnie crosses to a pay phone and 
dials.

                 JORDAN 
       And he did quit his job, which    
       I thought was a little weird.     
       I mean I had just met this   
       fucking guy.

A few beats, then into phone:

                 DONNIE
       Yo Paulie, its Donnie...  Yeah, 
       listen, I quit. 

Jordan studies Donnie as he continues his conversation...

                 JORDAN  
       There were other things about him 
       too, like his phosphorescent white 
       teeth and the fact that he wore 
       horn rims with clear lenses to 
       look more Waspy.  He also married 
       his first cousin --

INT. BAR - DAY  (JUN 88)

Jordan sits in mid-conversation with Donnie over beers.  

                 DONNIE 
       No problem, if we have a kid whos 
       a retard, well just leave it on 
       the steps of some institution. 

And as they continue drinking...

                 JORDAN 
       He was also a closet drug fiend. 
       Id known him less than a week 
       before he talked me into smoking 
       crack.

EXT. BACK OF BAR - DAY  (JUN 88)


Jordan and Donnie get high. Donnie holds a flame under a 
crack pipe.


                 JORDAN 
       The weird thing was when hed do 
       crack, his face would contort into 
       this bizarre, frozen mask like the 
       Phantom of the Opera.

Donnie does a hit of crack; his jaw twitches, then his 
facial muscles contort, locking up like a stroke victim.  
After a few beats, he hands the pipe to Jordan.

                 DONNIE 
       You now, take a hit!

Jordan takes a deep hit and holds it.  A beat, then:

                 JORDAN
       Omigod, I fuckin love you!!

                 JORDAN 
       I knew I had to make him my 
       partner.

INT. INVESTORS CENTER - DAY  (SEP 88) 

Jordan looks on as Donnie works the phone like a madman. 

                 JORDAN 
       Which turned out to be a great 
       move - Donnie was a fast learner 
       who transitioned into the penny 
       stock business quickly.  

EXT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO SHOP - DAY  (SEP 88)

Jordan and Donnie pull up to a defunct auto body shop, 
which has a For Lease sign in the window. 

                 JORDAN 
       So within months we started our 
       own firm out of an abandoned auto 
       body shop.

INT. KACANDES DINER - DAY  (OCT 88)

Jordan sits with CHESTER MING, ROBBIE FEINBERG, ALDEN 
KUPFERBERG (SEA OTTER) and BRAD, muscular and bald, 
with a Fu Manchu mustache.  

                 JORDAN 
       In addition to Donnie, I also 
       recruited my friends Sea Otter, 
       Chester and Robbie, who were at 
       the time all middling pot dealers. 

As a WAITRESS serves cheeseburgers:

                 JORDAN
       --see everyone wants to get rich, 
       so youre already half way there 
       by the time the call starts.

                 SEA OTTER
       I sold weed once to this Amish  
       dude, had one of those beards with 
       no mustache?



                 ROBBIE FEINBERG
       So?  

                 SEA OTTER
       He only wanted to make furniture.  

                 CHESTER MING
       Whats that got to do with 
       anything? 

                 SEA OTTER
       He just said everyone wants to  
       get rich.

                 ROBBIE FEINBERG
           (to Jordan)
       Thats true, you did.  

                 SEA OTTER
       Buddhists too, they dont give a 
       shit about money either.

                 CHESTER MING
       Man I could sell weed to anybody, 
       get a convent full of nuns fucking 
       wasted.  

And as Brad looks at Jordan and shakes his head:

INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO BODY SHOP - BULLPEN    
(OCT 88) 

We see the above guys working the phones. 

                 JORDAN 
       Brad, the guy I really wanted, 
       took a pass, since hed become the 
       Quaalude king of Bayside. 


EXT. BRADS HOUSE - BACKYARD GYM - DAY  (OCT 88)

Bare-chested, wearing kung fu pants, Brad sells ludes to 
a couple of HIGH SCHOOL KIDS. 

                 JORDAN  
       They were absolute morons, my 
       friends, but like I always said--


INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO BODY SHOP - BULLPEN - DAY   
(OCT 88)

Jordan emerges from his office into the garage area   
(the bullpen), looking on as Donnie, Chester, Robbie, Sea 
Otter and four other BROKERS (now including RUGRAT and 
Toby) make sales calls from the cheap desks.  

                 JORDAN 
       Give me them young, hungry and 
       stupid and in no time Ill make 
       them rich. 


EXT. MARINA - LONG ISLAND - SUNSET  (MAY 89)


On lounge chairs at the edge of a dock, bottle of wine 
nearby, Jordan sits with Teresa.  He smiles as she opens 
a jewelry case -- inside is a diamond tennis bracelet.

                 TERESA 
       Omigod.  Jordan.


                 JORDAN
       You like it?

                 TERESA
       Its beautiful.

Jordan helps her try it on.  She smiles, but he detects a 
wave of... something. 

                 JORDAN 
       Theyre small, I know, but the 
       stones are really high quality. 

                 TERESA
       No, no.  I love it.



                 JORDAN
       Then what?

They sit in silence.  Finally:

                 TERESA
       I dont know, its just -- these 
       stocks, these crappy companies. 

                 JORDAN
       In five years the Corleone family 
       will be completely legitimate. 


                 TERESA
       Why cant you be legitimate now?

                 JORDAN
       Its not illegal, Teresa, 
       technically.  I mean theyre real 
       stocks, theyre just...

                 TERESA
       Never gonna make anybody money. 
           (a few beats; then)
       Wouldnt you feel better selling 
       this junk to rich people, who can 
       afford to lose the money at least? 

                 JORDAN 
       Rich people dont buy penny 
       stocks.



                 TERESA
       Why not?

And on Jordans look:

                 JORDAN 
       Because theyre too smart, thats 
       why not.

INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO BODY SHOP - DAY  (AUG 89)


CLOSE ON Jordan, brow furrowing as his wheels turn.  

                 JORDAN 
       I mean what person of any 
       substance would trust this bunch 
       of jerk-offs?  Like the Pinhead, 
       Robbie Feinberg.

       trust him to pick up a rock.

                 JORDAN

       even think without moving his

       Well, you can probably figure that  
       out for yourself. 


INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO BODY SHOP - REAR - NIGHT  
(MAR 90)


The camera PUSHES IN on Jordan as he stands before a 
large dry erase board.

                 JORDAN 
       But what if they didnt sound like 
       jerk-offs?  What if I took this 
       bunch of nincompoops and molded 
       them in my own image?  I 
       reinvented the company, gave it a 
       new image, a new name.  Something 
       patrician, blue-blooded, something 
       that reeked of tradition and anti-
       semitism.  

And as his Brokers settle in to folding chairs--

                 JORDAN
       Gentlemen, welcome to Stratton 
       Oakmont.   The clients weve gone 
       after in the past -- theyre done.  
       We will now target exclusively the 
       wealthiest one percent of 
       Americans.  The methods weve used 
       -- over.  Loud, obnoxious sales 
       hype is worthless with these 
       people.  

                 JORDAN 
       In military terms its like carpet-
       bombing -- noisy, menacing and 
       only marginally effective.  As 
       Stratton brokers you will be laser-
       guided smart-bombs aimed at high-
       priority targets.  You will 
       establish an initial relationship 
       with your clients selling only 
       blue chip stocks -- then and only 
       then will you attempt to sell the 
       pink sheets, where the real money 
       is.  Now the key to every sale is 
       this:  

Jordan writes the word URGENCY on the board.

                 JORDAN 
       No one buys stock unless he thinks 
       its going up and going up now.  
       You must convince your client to 
       buy before the takeover happens, 
       before the lawsuit is settled, 
       before the patent is granted.    
       If he says Ill think about it and 
       call you back, its over, youre 
       dead!  No one calls back!  So you 
       have to create urgency --  

INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO SHOP BULLPEN - DAY     


Another day.  With Stratton Oakmont signage visible in 
the b.g., Jordan is on speakerphone with a potential 
CLIENT, the other Brokers listening in.

                 JORDAN
       --and once Kodak settles the 
       lawsuit, institutions will be 
       permitted to buy their shares in 
       large blocks again.  And when that 
       happens, which is any day now, 
       what do you think will happen to 
       the price of Kodak stock? 

                 CLIENT  
       Itll go up?

                 JORDAN
       Exactly.  Which is why you should 
       pick up 5000 shares today, a 
       $200,000 investment.  


INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO BODY SHOP - REAR - NIGHT


Jordan stands addressing his Brokers.


                 JORDAN
       Then you lower your voice.

Jordan pitches the client, his voice lowered.

                 JORDAN 
       Believe me, sir, you will not be 
       sorry. 

INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO BODY SHOP - REAR - NIGHT 


Jordan stands before the Brokers.

                 JORDAN 
       Then you wait.  Whoever speaks 
       first loses.  At this point, where 
       are we in the sale?  Chester?

                 CHESTER MING
       About to close?

                 JORDAN
       No, you sweet and sour douchebag!  
       Were at the beginning of the 
       beginning!  This is where the sale 
       starts.  You as a salesman are 
       almost hoping he says no so you 
       can finally do your fucking job!

INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO SHOP BULLPEN - DAY 

Jordan sits at the phone, waiting for a response.

                 CLIENT 
       I dont know, I dont think so. 

INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO BODY SHOP - REAR - NIGHT

Jordan stands before the Brokers.

                 JORDAN
       He doesnt know, he needs to 
       think, hes gotta ask his wife!  
       The fact is it doesnt matter what  
       the fuck he says!  If hes already 
       agreed that the stocks going up, 
       then the only real objection he 
       has at this point is he doesnt 
       trust you!  And he shouldnt trust 
       you, youre a fucking salesman!  
       So what do you say?


INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO SHOP BULLPEN - DAY     

Donnie talks on the phone to a Client.

                 DONNIE 
       Let me ask you this, sir -- had I 
       been your broker for the past 
       three to four years and made you 
       money on a consistent basis, you 
       probably wouldnt say you need to 
       think about it, youd probably say 
       pick me up three or four thousand 
       shares, am I right?  


                 CLIENT #2 
       Maybe.

The place is crowded; now 20 Brokers make up the sales 
force.  Sea Otter pitches a client. 

                 SEA OTTER
       Wait a second.  You mean to tell 
       me if I put you in Union Carbide 
       at 7 and took you out at 32--

Even more crowded, with 30 Brokers.

                 ROBBIE FEINBERG
       If I put you in Texas Instruments 
       at 11 and took you out at 47--

More Brokers still - now theres 45.

                 CHESTER MING
       --Walmart at 16 and took you out 
       at 95, you wouldnt say Chester  
       pick me up 10,000 shares?  Cmon.

                 CLIENT #3 
       Well yeah, in that case I would.


INT. STRATTON OAKMONT II - BULLPEN - DAY (NOV 90)

New offices now, a real brokerage firm.  The bullpen is 
large, with 75 Brokers at polished maple desks, sitting 
before computers talking into headsets.  

                 DONNIE 
       So the problem is that I dont 
       have the luxury of a track record.  
       Sir, let me reintroduce myself to 
       you.  My name is Donnie Azoff--

                 RUGRAT

                 TOBY WELCH
       --and I plan on being the top 
       broker in my firm this year.

                 SEA OTTER
       So what about this?  We start   
       small with 500 shares, a cash 
       outlay of $20,000.  

                 KALIL
       If the stock goes up 10%, will 
       that make you a rich man?  Of 
       course not.

                 KIMMIE BELZER
       If if goes down 10%, will it make 
       you a poor man?  No..

CUT TO:


                 CHESTER MING
       What this trade will do is serve 
       as a benchmark for future 
       business.  

                 PETER DEBLASIO
       The downside is minimal and the 
       upside is a long-term relationship 
       with a broker on Wall Street who 
       will consistently make you money.

                 JORDAN
       Your only regret will be that I 
       didnt call you six months ago.  

                 CLIENT #1 
           (to Robbie Feinberg)
       All right.

                 CLIENT #2 
           (to Sea Otter)
       Give me 300 shares.

                 CLIENT #3 
           (to Peter DeBlasio)
       1200 shares.

                 CLIENT #4 
           (to Jordan)
       Ill take 5000 shares.

INT. STRATTON OAKMONT II - BULLPEN - DAY  (APR 91)

4PM the place goes nuts as Jordan emerges from his office 
holding a spread sheet.  He addresses the crowd of 100 
BROKERS, which now includes a dozen WOMEN. 

                 JORDAN
       Everybody have a good week?        

Applause; war whoops.  


                 JORDAN 
       Id like to read you something.  
           (reads spread sheet)
       Month end, March 1991!  $28.7 
	million in gross commissions - all 
	in Stratton issues. Not bad for 
	penny stocks, huh boys? Not bad 
	for dumpin penny stocks.

The place goes WILD with applause.

                 JORDAN 
       And to celebrate with a weekly act 
       of debauchery, I have offered our 
       lovely sales assistant Danielle 
	Harrison ten thousand dollars to 
       have her head shaved!

Jordan motions to DANIELLE HARRISON, 19, pretty, sitting 
in a chair nearby.  Behind her, Rugrat uses clippers to 
shave her thick brown mane.  The place goes nuts. 

                 JORDAN 
       FYI, Danielle tells me shes using 
       the money for breast implants!  Is 
       this a great company or what?!!

More wild applause as Jordan signals across the bullpen 
to Donnie.  We hear the opening strains of Stars & 
Stripes Forever as he opens the door to a 

COLLEGE MARCHING BAND 

dressed in underwear and hats.  The music continues as 
somersaulting GYMNASTS and BATON-TWIRLERS bring up the 
rear.  As they march through the bullpen to cheers--

FROM THE KITCHEN -- two dozen TUXEDO-CLAD WAITERS emerge 
carrying trays of champagne and hors doeuvres.  The 
music continues as two dozen STRIPPERS bolt in, gyrating 
among the BROKERS.  As Jordan surveys the insanity:

                 JORDAN 
       Word spread throughout Wall  
       Street -- I was becoming a legend. 
       Forbes Magazine even called to do 
       a profile on me... 

INT. STRATTON OAKMONT II - JORDANS OFFICE - DAY      
(SEP 91) 

Jordan finishes up an interview with a FEMALE FORBES 
REPORTER - ALIYAH FARRAN.  They shake hands, then he 
smiles for the camera - CLICK!

                 JORDAN 
       A total fucking hatchet job.

INT. JORDANS MANHATTAN APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MORNING  
(OCT 91) 

A gorgeous place; city views.  As Teresa sits nearby, a 
distraught Jordan paces, holding the copy of Forbes. 

                 JORDAN
       That conniving little twat! 
           (reading)
       The Wolf of Wall Street.        

                 TERESA
           (on the bright side) 
       Your hair looks good. 

                 JORDAN
       Jordan Belfort, a twisted version 
       of Robin Hood who takes from the 
       rich and gives to himself and his  
       merry band of brokers.   

                 TERESA 
       Theres no such thing as bad 
       publicity, sweetie.  

INT. STRATTON OAKMONT II - BULLPEN - LATER THAT DAY

Bustling with activity.  Jordan enters, crosses toward 
his office.  Off to the side of the bullpen, he notices 
three dozen YOUNG MEN in business suits.  He approaches 
his assistant JANET, 20s, dressed all in black.

                 JORDAN
       The hells all this?   

                 JANET
       The Forbes article.  Theyre 
       applying for jobs.

They spot Jordan, start clamoring, waving their resumes.

                 JOB APPLICANTS
       Mr. Belfort!  Over here!  Sir!

                 JORDAN 
       Forbes had made me a superstar.  
       Every day dozens of money-crazed 
       kids beat a path to my door with 
       resumes they hadnt even bothered 
       to spellcheck.  

Jordan crosses through the packed bullpen, where 150 
BROKERS, no older than 22, are crammed elbow to elbow 
talking into phones.  Some have pets, which they tend to 
while they work -- iguanas, snakes, turtles, even a 
chimp.  Others are getting shoulder rubs by Masseuses     
or being fitted for suits by a TAILOR.  Over the above:

                 JORDAN 
       If we hired em, they dropped out 
       of college overnight and blew 
       whatever allowance they had on a 
       new suit from our in-house tailor.  
       The median age of our brokerage 
       couldnt get served in the bar 
       down the street.


INT. FBI BREAK ROOM - DAY  (OCT 91)

PATRICK DENHAM sits sipping coffee as he reads Forbes.  

                 JORDAN 
       Not this guy though -- what the 
       fuck is he even doing here?  He 
       read the Forbes article, too, but 
       he already had a job.

INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - DAY  (MAR 92)

CLOSE ON two BROKERS wrestling while others cheer them 
on.  PULL BACK to reveal the place from the opening.  300 
young Brokers and their hot ASSISTANTS work the phones.  

                 JORDAN  
       Within months, we doubled in size, 
       moved to even bigger offices.  

Two other Brokers pump themselves up, chest-bumping and 
screaming like football players. 

                 JORDAN 
       It was a madhouse, a greed-fest, 
       with equal parts cocaine, 
       testosterone and body fluids.   

INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - MENS ROOM - DAY (MAR 92)

In a stall, two Brokers snort coke, while another Broker 
fucks a Sales Assistant perched on the sink.  

                 JORDAN  
       I had to declare the office a fuck-
       free zone between the hours of 9 
       and 7, but even that didnt help.

Taped to the mirror we see a MEMO -- inside a red circle, 
two anatomically correct stick figures fuck doggy-style, 
a red line slashing through them.   

                 JORDAN 
       Actually the madness started on 
       our very first day, when one of 
       our brokers, Ben Jenner, 
       christened the elevator by  
       getting a blowjob from a sales 
       assistant. 

INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - LOBBY - DAY (JAN 92)

Two dozen Brokers cheer, watching through the rising 
glass elevator as BEN JENNER, 25, gets a blowjob from a 
brunette SALES ASSISTANT. 


                 JORDAN 
       Her name was Pam and to her 
       credit, she did have an amazing 
       technique, with this wild twist 
       and jerk motion.  

INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - JORDANS OFFICE - DAY      
(FEB 92)

As Pam blows Jordan, Donnie fucks her from behind. 

                 JORDAN 
       Eventually Ben married her, which 
       was pretty amazing considering she 
       blew every guy in the office.

INSERT POLAROID - (JUN 92)


A wedding photo of Ben and Pam.

                 JORDAN 
       He got depressed and killed 
       himself three years later.


INSERT POLAROID - (JUN 95)

A crime scene photo; Ben in his underwear, dead on a 
bathroom floor, a gun near his head, which oozes blood.  

                 JORDAN 
       Anyway, in an attempt to maintain 
       order, I hired my dad Max as 
       defacto CFO and head of the 
       Gestapo. 

INT. JORDANS PARENTS APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

MAX BELFORT sits smoking, watching a rerun of The 
Equalizer on TV.  His wife, LEAH, does needlepoint.  

                 JORDAN  
       We called him Mad Max because of 
       his hair-trigger temper, which 
       could be set off by something as 
       innocuous as a ringing telephone. 

The phone RINGS.

                 MAX
       Who the hell has the goddamn gall 
       to call this house on a Tuesday 
       evening!  Goddammit!

                 JORDAN 
       But then the weirdest thing would 
       happen.  Though hed never been 
       near England, hed pick up the 
       phone and affect an ever-so-slight 
       British accent.  

Greatly agitated, Max stomps toward the phone.

                 JORDAN 
       This was his other persona -- the 
       super polite, ever-gracious Sir 
       Max.

                 MAX
           (into phone)
       Hello?...  Yes, Gene, right-eo.  
       Good-good then...  Cheerio.

                 JORDAN 
       It was absolutely bizarre.  Hed 
       hang up...

                 MAX
           (hangs up phone)
       Goddamn fucking halfwit!

                 JORDAN 
       And become Mad Max all over again.

Max curses a blue streak as he stomps back to his chair. 

INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - JORDANS OFFICE - DAY     
(MAR 92)

Holding a HEADSHOT of the Dwarf from the opening, Jordan 
sits talking with Donnie, Robbie and Rugrat.  

                 JORDAN 
       What if he gets hurt?

                 ROBBIE
       Hell be wearing a helmet.  Plus 
       theyve got, like, superhuman 
       strength anyway. 

                 DONNIE
       I did hear you're not supposed to 
       make direct eye contact.  If you 
       look at them too long in their 
       eyes they get freaked out - their 
       wires cross.

                 JORDAN
       I think theres a limit to how far 
       we can go... I mean we can throw 
       shit at him and - 

                 DONNIE
       They have a lot of feelings. 

                 JORDAN
       Theres a specific thing that 
       theyll do - You can throw him at 
       a dart board but if you want him 
       to show his cock or -

                 ROBBIE
       Yes, thats what this guy does.

                 RUGRAT
       Thats his gift.

                 ROBBIE
       Can we also bowl with him?

                 RUGRAT
       His brother is actually the 
       bowler. 

                 ROBBIE
       They strap a skateboard to him and 
       throw him down an alley. 

                 RUGRAT
       Theyre ornery, too, the little 
       pricks.  You gotta be careful.

                 JORDAN
       Get some tranq darts.

                 DONNIE 
       A little straitjacket. 

                 JORDAN
       Whats the liability on something 
       like this?

                 RUGRAT
       That's a whole different thing.  I 
       can get on the phone with some 
       people. I can talk to the 
       insurance company and tell them 
       exactly what we're going to do. 
       But I think we go back to the same 
       plan - loophole - if we don't 
       really consider them people I 
       think we are in the clear.

                 DONNIE
       I think we should keep one in the 
       office because I think theyre 
       good luck. 

                 JORDAN
       Treat it like the fuckin' thing it 
       is.  He's coming in. We're paying 
       him for something. Treat him with 
       respect. And you just shake his 
       hand like you don't even think 
       anything's wrong.

                 DONNIE
       You just look like something else 
       is going on. 

                 RUGRAT
       You dont look at his eyes.

                 DONNIE
       Say thank you for being here.

                 ROBBIE
       You dont turn your back on him. 
       Its a sign of disrespect.

                 DONNIE
       If you want a cracker or something 
       - Im gonna have some treats in my 
       pocket. I want to be in a strip 
       club with you guys. Literally pull 
       out a brief case and have a little 
       fuckin' guy pop out of there. You 
       know how much fuckin' pussy you 
       get? 

                 JORDAN
       The point is get it out.

                 DONNIE
       Get the jokes out now. Get the 
       fuckin jokes out now. 

                 JORDAN
       Youre gonna fuck it up. Purge all 
       this shit right now.

                 DONNIE
       Thats what Im saying - 

                 JORDAN
       When he comes in the room, I want 
       him to feel like a human being -

                 DONNIE
       Business. Business. Its fuckin 
       business, bro.

                 JORDAN
       I want him to feel just like a 
       normal human being. Cause you know 
       - like one of us. One of us. 

                 DONNIE
       Like hes an actual human being. 
       One of us. 

                 JORDAN
       Gobble, gobble we accept you, one 
       of us! One of us!

                 ALL
       One of us.

Janet pokes her head in.

                 JANET
       Your dads coming.  With the

       Can you stop him?

                 JANET
       Fuck you, you stop him.

The guys straighten up and head to desk, settle in. Max 
blows in past her, waving a 3-inch-thick bill:

                 MAX
       $430,000 dollars in one month!!  
       Four-hundred-and-thirty-thousand 
       dollars in one month!!

                 JORDAN
       Hello, Father. 
           (Maxs expression 
            doesnt budge)
       Theyre business expenses. Just 
       relax. 

The guys titter at business expenses.

                 MAX
       If you bastards don't wipe those 
       smug fucking looks off your faces, 
       I swear to God I'm gonna wipe em 
       off for you!
           (back to Jordan)
       Are you insane?

                 ROBBIE
       Actually, Max, my portion of the 
       bill is hardly anything, so Im on 
       the same page as you --

                 MAX
       Shut the fuck up, Feinberg, you 
       only have a portion because of my 
       son, you worthless twerp!

                 DONNIE 
           (chuckles)
       Twerp.

       You zip it, too, Azoff, those 
       boiling teeth of yours are hurting 
       my fucking eyes!  
           (turning to Jordan)
       My own son!  From my very loins!  
       What do you think this is?

                 JORDAN
       Will you calm down --

                 MAX
       You don't think there's any end in 
       sight, do you?  It's all one giant 
       party to you schmendricks!  

                 MAX

       $26,000 for one dinner!!

                 JORDAN
       Donnie ordered sides.

                 DONNIE 
       Yeah, that was... Sorry.

           (restraining a grin)
       You tell me, Dad.

                 MAX
       Its a goddamn prostitution ring 
       is what it is!!

Jordan feigns shock, turns to Donnie: did you know it was 
a prostitution ring?!

                 DONNIE 
       Doesnt the IRS allow for T&A?

                 MAX
       Its T&E and stop fucking with me!  
       What kind of hookers take credit 
       cards, anyway?! 

Jordan takes the bill, starts flipping through it. 

                 JORDAN 
       In Stratton parlance, there were 
       three kinds of hookers.  There 
       were blue chips, the top of the 
       line.  Model material.  They were 
       priced between $300 and $500 and 
       made you wear a condom unless you 
       gave them a hefty tip, which I 
       always did.

       dollar range.

BROKERS WATCH.

                 JORDAN 
       Finally there were pink sheets,  
       skanks, the bottom of the barrel. 

A PINK SHEET HOOKER, COVERED IN TATTOOS, IS ON ALL      
FOURS AS SEA OTTER RIDES HER LIKE A PONY.

                 JORDAN 
       They usually cost a hundred or 
       less, and if you didn't wear a 
       condom, you'd get a penicillin 
       shot the next day and pray your 
       dick didn't fall off.


THE ABOVE-MENTIONED PINK SHEET HOOKER SITS ON A STOOL,    
AS SEA OTTER FUCKS HER. 

                 JORDAN 
       Not that we didnt fuck them, too. 
       Believe me, we did. 

Behind him, the other guys wait their turns.


BACK TO SCENE

Max continues to steam so Jordan ushers Robbie, Rugrat 
and Donnie out the door.

                 JORDAN
       Give us a minute, will you, guys?

He closes the door, then stretches a bit, exaggeratedly, 
letting out a little moan.

                 MAX
       Whats the matter?

                 JORDAN
       Nothing, just... My backs been 
       killing me.  Pain shooting down my 
       leg.  Not to worry, itll pass.

                 MAX
       What do the doctors say? 

                 JORDAN 
       Doctors, what do they know? Im on 
       like twenty different medications.  
           (re: the Amex bill)
       Look, I know it's hard for you to 
       make sense of these expenses, but 
       there's a method here, okay?


Max waits to hear it; Jordan gestures to the bullpen

                 MAX
       And you have to lead by example, 
       is that it?
           (Jordan nods)
       Im tellin ya, kid, one of these 
       days... one of these days the 
       chickens are gonna come home to 
       roost.

                 JORDAN
       In order to keep these guys 
       working, I gotta keep em 
       spending.  I need to keep them 
       chasing the dream. You flash some 
       cash, they do the same. It keeps 
       them motivated.  

                 MAX
       Pissing away money? Thats what 
       motivates you kids?  

                 JORDAN
       I could afford to pay them more, 
       but then they wouldn't need me as 
       much.  And as long as they need me 
       they'll always fear me. I know it 
       sounds crazy.

                 MAX
       Crazy?  This... is obscene.

He turns and exits.  Jordan watches him go, thinking. 

                 JORDAN  
       It was obscene -- in the normal 
       world.  But who wanted to live 
       there?

EXT. BEACH HOUSE - SOUTH HAMPTON - DAY  (JUN 92)

Massive, with an Olympic-size pool overlooking the beach.   
Dozens of luxury cars parked outside.  On a balcony, 
Jordan is mid-speech, in a bathing suit, addressing the 
Strattonites  below, Teresa at his side.

                 JORDAN 
       -- so enjoy yourselves, you all 
       deserve a celebration.  Cept for 
       Kimmie, shes lazy and she steals.  
           (off laughter, Kimmie 
            flips him the bird; 
            he blows her a kiss)
       But, everybody, keep this in mind.  

                 JORDAN 
       As my friend Donnie Azoff says, 
       If you wanna party with the boys, 
       you gotta wake up with the men.  
       Monday morning I want you all 
       looking razor-sharp.  Cuz 
       Strattons got a few things on the 
       horizon, things thatre gonna take 
       it right up into the fucking 
       stratosphere!

The Crowd goes nuts.  One Broker lets loose a wolf-howl, 
and the crowd toasts Jordan, chanting his name.

                 CROWD
       Jor-dan!  Jor-dan!  Jor-dan!

As Jordan looks down smiling like a benevolent dictator --

                 JORDAN (PRE-LAP)
       Fuck Merrill Lynch, this way we 
       become the underwriters.

                 ROBBIE (PRE-LAP)
       Like an investment bank.

INT. BEACH HOUSE - SOUTH HAMPTON - (LATER THAT) DAY

GORGEOUS PEOPLE dance/drink/snort coke.  Upstairs, Jordan 
plays pool with Sea Otter, Donnie, Robbie, Toby and 
Rugrat, assigning ludes with every pocketed ball.

                 JORDAN
       Exactly.  We do our own IPOs and 
       we will print money.  

                 SEA OTTER
       Eat like a bird, shit like an 
       elephant, baby!

                 JORDAN
       They can take their Harvard asses 
       under our desks and suck our 
       cocks.
           (to Rugrat)
       How soon can you get the paperwork 
       filed?

                 RUGRAT 
           (super-stoned)
       Cant we talk about this Monday? 

                 JORDAN
       Its a simple fucking question. 


                 RUGRAT
       Except Im looking at three of you 
       right now. 

                 ROBBIE
       Weve got Arncliffe National, 
       theyre looking to go public, 
       weve got -- 

                 DONNIE 
           (very luded)
       Oh, oh, Steve... Steve...

                 JORDAN
       What?

                 DONNIE 
       ...Steve... M-m-madden...

Donnie gesticulates wildly. The guys crack up.  WE PUSH 
IN ON Donnie, practically drooling, as Jordan gives us a 
quick tutorial on ludes...

QUAALUDE TUTORIAL

CUT TO: Extreme close up of guys doing drugs. 

                 JORDAN 
       The quaalude was first synthesized  
       in 1951 by an Indian doctor -- 
       thats dot Indian, not feathers -- 
       as a sedative, and was prescribed 
       to stressed housewives with sleep 
       disorders.  Pretty soon someone 
       figured out that if you resisted 
       the urge to sleep for fifteen 
       minutes, you got a pretty kick-ass 
       high from it.  Didnt take long 
       for people to start abusing ludes, 
       course, and in 1982 the U.S. 
       Government Schedule Oned them, 
       along with the rest of the world.  
       Which meant there was only a 
       finite amount of these things 
       left.  No shit, you cant even 
       find em anymore today.  You 
       peoplere all shit outta luck.


BACK TO SCENE 

                 JORDAN
           (to Donnie)
       Whatre you saying, buddy?
           (to the others)
       Shhhh... listen to him...


                 DONNIE 
       Ssshhhhoes... shhhoooess...

Jordan suspects Donnie may actually be onto something.  
But just then...

                 SEA OTTER
       Holy fuck. 

Jordan peers over the balcony where Sea Otters looking.

NAOMI LAPAGLIA.  22, the hottest blonde ever, has entered 
the party with her date BLAIR.  She smiles, full lips 
parting over perfect white teeth, a ridiculously short 
dress barely covering her long tan legs and full breasts.

                 RUGRAT
       My nutsacks about to explode. 

                 ROBBIE
       Someones gotta take that down.


Theres no debate who that someone should be.  Eyes 
locked on Naomi, Jordan makes his way downstairs.

WITH NAOMI taking in the party, her eyes flitting to 
things: art, chandeliers, crystal, etc.

                 NAOMI 
       A lotta people would look at me 
       and think: golddigger, shes out 
       to land the richest husband she 
       can.  But you see, I came from 
       nothing.  Like, below the poverty 
       line.  And when you come from 
       nothing, being rich means never 
       having to go back to that.

Jordan approaches CRISTY, 20s, one of his guests.

                 CRISTY 
       Jordan, hey.  
           (he smiles; Cristy 
            picks up his intent)
       Have you met my friend Naomi? 

Jordan takes Naomis hand, doesnt let go.



                 JORDAN
       Naomi.

                 NAOMI
       You have an awesome house.  I 
       dont think Ive ever been in a 
       house like this.

                 JORDAN
       You like it?  I just got it.  I 
       guess its okay.  Six bedrooms, 
       two hot-tubs, one off the master 
       suite overlooking the water.  You 
       like to jet-ski?

Naomis date Blair offers his hand to break them apart.  
Toby Welch lurks behind him, giving him the evil-eye.

                 BLAIR
       Hi.  Blair Hollingsworth.  

Jordan barely acknowledges him, focused on Naomi. 

Outside, HILDY AZOFF chats with Teresa.  Her eyes stray 
to Jordan chatting up Naomi.  Teresas eyes follow hers 
and sees them.  Ouch.  Hildy goes.

                 JORDAN
       Youre telling me youve never jet-
       skied in your life?!


                 NAOMI
       Never.

                 BLAIR
       Yknow, we really should hit it, 
       theres two other parties were 
       sposed to get to --

                 JORDAN
       What?  You just got here.  Stay.

Naomi looks like shed like to.  Hildy approaches, 
introduces herself, then:

                 HILDY 
       Jordan, Teresa needs your help.

                 JORDAN
       With what?

                 HILDY 
       I dunno, youll have to ask your 
       wife what she wants.

Jordan sees: Teresa is watching from afar.

                 DONNIE
       Oh sweet Jesus!

Jordan turns to see a drunk Donnie, cock in hand, jerking 
off to Naomi.  Hildy comes running over.
                                
                 HILDY 
       Donnie!  What the fuck are you 
       doing?!

During the melee that follows -- Hildy admonishing 
Donnie, Blair removing Naomi from the party --

                 JORDAN 
       The day I met Naomi was the day  I 
       truly became the Wolf.  Every guy 
       wanted her -- so I had to have 
       her.

-- Jordan watches her go.  Naomi shoots a glance back to 
him and, like that, hes hooked.

INT. SIGN OF THE DOVE - MANHATTAN - NIGHT  (JUN 92)

Romantic; elegant.  Over a bottle of 53 Lafite, Jordan 
sits in mid conversation with Naomi, who is stunning in a 
low-cut black cocktail dress.  


                 JORDAN
       Bay Ridge.  Thats near Staten 
       Island?

                 NAOMI
       Brooklyn, across the Verrazano 
       Bridge.  Guinea gulch.  Ever been? 

                 JORDAN
       Youre Italian?  

                 NAOMI
       My dads side.  Also Dutch, 
       German, English -- Im a mutt.  
       Actually I have family over there, 
       in London.  My Aunt Emma.  

                 JORDAN 
       That explains it then. 

                 NAOMI
       What?

                 JORDAN
           (smiles)
       Youre a Duchess.  The Duchess of 
       Bay Ridge.

Naomi smiles, flags a passing WAITER.



                 NAOMI
       Could I have a straw please?

The Waiter nods, heads off.  A few beats, then:

                 NAOMI 
       So I was a little surprised you 
       asked Cristy for my number.  


                 JORDAN
       How come?

                 NAOMI
       Arent you married?

                 JORDAN
       Married people cant have friends?

Naomi smiles.  The Waiter brings the straw.  She opens 
it, slips it in her red wine glass.  Off Jordans look: 

                 NAOMI 
       So I dont stain my teeth.

And as she sips the wine seductively through the straw...

EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - NIGHT  

Jordans Ferrari makes its way over the bridge, heading 
back toward Brooklyn. 
                  
			NAOMI
       --then at night I do my designs.  

INT. JORDANS FERRARI - CONTINUOUS  

Jordan drives, Naomi next to him.  

                 NAOMI
       An entire line of lingerie -- 
       camisoles, bustiers, panties. 

Jordan glances over -- her dress is riding up her thigh. 

                 JORDAN 
       She designs panties?!  Jesus 
       fucking Christ!

Naomi smiles.

                 JORDAN
       Sounds like something I might 
       invest in.  Venture capital.
 
                 NAOMI
       Well we should definitely keep in 
       touch, then.



                 JORDAN
       Absolutely.

He pulls over outside her brownstone.  
 
                 NAOMI
       Thats me. 

                 JORDAN 
       Think, Jordan, think!  How can you 
       get up to her apartment?!

They look at each other.  We can almost hear Jordans 
heart pounding.   

                 NAOMI
       You wanna come up for some tea?

INT. NAOMIS APARTMENT - NIGHT 

A small, cozy apartment.  Naomi enters, Jordan close 
behind.  She picks up Rocky, her yapping Maltese.  

                 NAOMI
       Say hi, Rocky.

Naomi waves Rockys paw.  Jordan smiles.

                 NAOMI 
       Why dont you light a fire?  Ill 
       be right out.

Jordan nods, takes in her scent as she walks away.  

                 JORDAN 
       God, please help me.  How can I 
       fuck this girl?

As he crouches by the fireplace, his skypager vibrates.  
He checks the readout: Teresa.  His face falls as he 
hits the silent button, mind racing with guilt.

                 JORDAN 
       Thats it, youre leaving.  Youre 
       going home to your wife.

Jordan stands, turns around -- NAOMI is in the doorway, 
naked except for high heels.

                 JORDAN 
       As you can probably guess, I 
       fucked her goddamn brains out.  


INT. NAOMIS BEDROOM - NIGHT 

Rocky yaps incessantly as Jordan pounds away atop Naomi. 

                 JORDAN 
       For eleven seconds.

Jordan cums loudly, convulsively.  


                 JORDAN
       Im sorry, I--

                 NAOMI
       Did you cum?  

                 JORDAN
           (nods; gasping)
       Yeah, but Im still hard.

Jordan looks down at her.  

                 JORDAN  
       Being inside her... was like your 
       cock went to heaven and God 
       himself was cupping your balls.

And as they start fucking again...

INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - JORDANS OFFICE - DAY     
(JUN 92) 

Jordan sits at his desk, telephone to his ear. 

                 JORDAN 
       I couldnt get enough.  

INT. NAOMIS APARTMENT - DAY  (JUN 92)

CLOSE ON Naomi, who talks on the phone, smiling.  We PULL 
BACK to see the apartment is packed with flowers.

                 JORDAN 
       Every chance we got, wed sneak 
       off together...

INT. LIMOSINE - NIGHT (AUG 92)

Giggling like a child, Jordan pours coke from a vial, 
creating a little mound atop one of Naomis breasts.

                 JORDAN
       Hold still, dont move.
           (to the Driver)
       Watch the potholes!

More giggling, then he snorts the coke off her breast, 
burying his face in it as he climbs on top of her.  Naomi 
laughs uncontrollably as the limo glides to a stop.  The 
door opens from outside -- the Doorman?  

                 TERESA 
       Get out of the fucking car.

Jordan looks up, locks eyes with Teresa.  He jumps off 
Naomi, stumbles out, closing the door behind himself.

EXT. JORDANS MANHATTAN APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 

        JORDAN
What are you doing home?    

			TERESA
			That whore from the party?  
                How could you do this to 
                me?!

The limo takes off.  Teresa starts crying...

                 JORDAN 
       I thought you were at the beach 
       house, I--

                 TERESA 
       I married you when you had  
       nothing-- 

                 JORDAN
       Teresa... I dont know what to 
       say. 

                 TERESA
       Youre like a totally different 
       person. 

                 JORDAN
       Im not.  Im sorry.  I made a 
       mistake, okay?

                 TERESA
       Tell me you dont love her.  


                 JORDAN
       I...  

                 TERESA
           (off his silence)
       Jordan?

Jordan says nothing.  Finally, Teresa starts sobbing.  

                 JORDAN  
       I felt horrible. 

Jordan holds her, letting her cry. 


                 JORDAN 
       Three days later I filed for 
       divorce and moved Naomi into the 
       apartment. 

INT. JORDANS MANHATTAN APARTMENT - DINING ROOM - DUSK  
(SEP 92)

Completely remodelled, all new furniture.   Jordan and 
Naomi sit at the table, set for a candle-light dinner.  

                 JORDAN 
       Say what you will, but the Duchess   
       did have style.  She brought in a 
       decorator, feng shuid the place--            
       she even hired a gay butler.  

NICHOLAS THE BUTLER, 40s, enters with hot towels on a 
silver tray.  

                 JORDAN
       Thank you, Nicholas.

Jordan takes a towel, wipes his face.  Naomi smiles.

                 JORDAN  
       He was smart, sophisticated, 
       really great.  Except for that  
       one time... 


INT. JORDANS MANHATTAN APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

A GAY ORGY is in progress, a dozen naked MEN, including 
Nicholas, in various sexual positions about the room. 



                 NAOMI
       Omigod!

INT. JORDANS MANHATTAN APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Jordan sits across from a very shaken Naomi.

                 NAOMI
       He must have thought I was at my 
       mothers. 

                 JORDAN
       Where were they?  In the bedroom?

                 NAOMI
       They were right here!


                                      50.
A beat, then Jordan realizes.  He jumps off the couch 
like its on fire.  

                 NAOMI 
       It gets worse.  After I chased 
       them out, I checked the apartment.  

                 JORDAN 
       The motherfucker stole fifty grand 
       in cash and jewelry.

INT. JORDANS MANHATTAN APARTMENT - LIBRARY - DAY     
(OCT 92)


With Nicholas seated in a chair, Jordan sits across from 
him.  Pacing behind him is Donnie, coked-up, face 
contorted, frothing with rage.  Nearby, giant Chester 
Ming sits quietly, saying nothing.

                 JORDAN
       I just want my stuff back, okay?

                 NICHOLAS THE BUTLER
       I didnt take anything.

                 DONNIE 
           (in his face)
       I should kill you, cocksucker!  
       You do not fuck with this man!

Jordan holds Donnie off.  Turns back to Nicholas.

                 JORDAN
       You were high, things got out of 
       control, I get it.  Believe me I 
       do, I have a Phd in debauchery.   

                 NICHOLAS THE BUTLER
       I didnt do it. 

                 DONNIE 
       Ill knock your fuckin teeth out, 
       motherfucker!

                 JORDAN
       Just give me the money, give me 
       the jewelry, and well forget the 
       whole thing. 

                 NICHOLAS THE BUTLER
       Its because Im gay, isnt it?

                 JORDAN
       Nicholas.  You could fuck a baby 
       sheep as far as I care, on my 
       brand new fucking sofa.  What I 
       wont stand for is being robbed.  

                 NICHOLAS THE BUTLER
       Im telling you the truth.

                 JORDAN
       Ill ask you one last time.

                 DONNIE 
       Youre dead, you piece of shit!

                 NICHOLAS THE BUTLER
       Jordan, please.



                 JORDAN
       Fine. 

Jordan nods to Chester.  Without a word, he crosses to 
Nicholas and BAMMM!!  Nicholass nose splits open like a 
ripe plum, blood spurting everywhere.  Tough-guy Donnie 
takes one look, then SPEWS vomit into a garbage pail.  
And as Chester pummels Nicholass face into chopped 
meat...

                 JORDAN   
       Its amazing the kind of loyalty 
       money will buy.  I mean Chester 
       almost killed this prick. 

Chester starts to hang Nicholas over the balcony by his 
legs.  Jordan stops him.

                 JORDAN 
       I finally called the cops, mainly 
       to save Nicholass life. 

INT. JORDANS MANHATTAN APARTMENT - FOYER - DAY 

With the bloodied Nicholas in the background, Jordan 
talks to two NYPD COPS, handing them each a wad of cash. 

                 JORDAN 
       I gave them each a thousand bucks 
       and told them what Nicholas had 
       done.  Then they kicked his ass.

As the Cops swat Nicholas with their nightsticks:

        COP #1
	Fuckin thief, huh?

	COP #2
	Piece of shit.

And as they hustle Nicholas out...

                 JORDAN  
       Loyalty, like I said.  Which was 
       the key component to my incredible 
       fucking success. 

EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY (OCT 92)

As Jordan golfs with Donnie, Chester, Robbie, Toby and 
some hookers, Brad pulls up in a golf cart with a cash-
filled gym bag.

                 JORDAN 
       Besides Brad, I had eight other 
       ratholes, close friends whod 
       own stock on paper, but kick the 
       profits back to me after I drove 
       the price through the roof. 

They hug, then Jordan adds the gym bag to several others 
on the back of his golf cart.  Donnie tries to befriend 
Brad; Brad isnt interested.

                 JORDAN 
       The SEC knew I was doing something 
       shady, but they couldnt figure 
       out what the fuck it was. 

INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - BULLPEN - (ANOTHER) DAY 

Jordan, Max and securities lawyer MANNY RISKIN exit the 
kitchen with coffees.  

                 MANNY RISKIN 
       Im telling you -- piss on the 
       SECs leg, youll end up with your 
       tits in a ringer.

FREEZE FRAME - Manny stuffs a cruller into his mouth.

                 JORDAN 
       My securities attorney, Manny 
       Riskin.  Seven hundred an hour to 
       be the voice of doom. 

BACK TO SCENE

                 JORDAN
       Its under control.  Will you 
       relax already?

Just then, Max spots a BROKER break-dancing as three 
other Brokers look on...  

                 MAX
       What the fuck is this imbecile 
       doing?!

Max crosses off, starts screaming at the break-dancing 
Broker.  Jordan keeps walking with Manny.

                 JORDAN  
       The SEC sent two lawyers down to 
       review our files, so I set them  
       up in our conference room.

Jordan passes the conference room, looks in the window-- 
two SEC ATTORNEYS wear coats as they review documents.  

                 JORDAN 
       Then I had it bugged and the air 
       conditioning locked till it felt 
       like Antarctica in there.  

One of the SEC Attorneys blows into his hands for warmth. 
Manny follows Jordan toward the bullpen, his frenzied 
Brokers working the phones.

                 JORDAN 
       So here they were, looking for a 
       smoking gun while I was firing a 
       bazooka right under their noses.  
       It was our first IPO, and we were 
       driving the stock price to the 
       fucking moon. 

                 BROKER #1
       Arncliffe National, its on fire! 

                 BROKER #2
           (voice lowered)
       Believe me, your grandkids will 
       thank you.

                 BROKER #3
           (to Sales Assistant)
       Arncliffe National, ten thousand 
       shares!

Jordan speaks directly to camera as he continues walking 
through the bullpen.

                 JORDAN 
       See an IPO is an initial public 
       offering, the first time a stock 
       is offered for sale to the general 
       population.  

                 JORDAN  
       As the firm taking the company 
       public, we set the initial price, 
       then sold those shares back to --  
           (stops; then)
       You know what, youre probably not 
       following what Im saying.  The 
       question is, was it legal? 
       Absolutely not. But we were making 
       more money that we knew what to do 
       with. 

EXT. BANK - DAY - ESTABLISHING (OCT 92)

INT. BANK - SAFE DEPOSIT VAULT - DAY  (OCT 92)

Alone in a private room, Jordan unloads a small suitcase 
filled with stacks and stacks of hundred dollar bills. 

                 JORDAN   
       But I figured it out.  

CLOSE ON - a huge diamond engagement ring. 



                 NAOMI 
       Omigod!!

INT. FOUR SEASONS RESTAURANT - NIGHT  (OCT 92)

Jordan is down on one knee, proposing; Naomi 
hyperventilates as he puts the ring on her finger -- a 
seven carat, yellow canary diamond in a platinum setting. 

                 JORDAN 
       I held my bachelor party at the 
       Tangiers in Las Vegas -- one last 
       blowout for the Gods before I 
       settled down for good.  


INT. TRANS CAPITAL AIRLINES - JUMBO JET - NIGHT

Inside a jumbo jet, a wild, mid-air party is in progress.  

                 JORDAN 
       A hundred Strattonites flew in 
       with fifty hookers and enough 
       drugs to open a pharmacy.

Various images -- Stratton Brokers drink, do coke, a half-
dozen in mid-orgy with Hookers, naked in the aisle as 
others pour champagne on them.  

                 JORDAN 
       All told, the weekend cost me 
       almost two million dollars--

PERIOD VEGAS ADS

INT. TANGIERS - PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - DAY

The Tangiers Presidential Suite is a shambles on the 
level of Hiroshima.  A giant crystal chandelier lays 
shattered on the floor; Jordan asleep in the massive bed, 
a Blue Chip Hooker on either side of him; other passed-
out BODIES lay amid debris and broken, toppled furniture.    

*

                 JORDAN 
       But the wedding was like something 
       out of a fairy tale--

EXT. OCEAN CLUB - BAHAMAS - SUNSET  (DEC 92)


Gorgeous; tropical.  Hundreds of FAMILY and FRIENDS 
(Janet, Toby Welch, Peter DeBlasio and Kimmie Belzer) 
look on as Jordan and Naomi walk up the aisle.

                 JORDAN 
       --with Naomi my Duchess, me her 
       handsome Duke and The Bahamas 
       Ocean Club our castle. 


INT. OCEAN CLUB - BAHAMAS - BALLROOM - NIGHT 

Jordan and Naomi waltz, their Guests joining in.

                 JORDAN 
       Of course after that bachelor 
       party, the Duke needed a few 
       penicillin shots so he could 
       safely consummate the marriage.


INT. OCEAN CLUB - BAHAMAS - BALLROOM - LATER


As Jordan and Naomi mingle with a few Strattonites, 
videographer BARRY KLEINMAN, 40s, approaches Rugrat and 
his DATE, ABBY with a video camera:

                 BARRY KLEINMAN
       Im Barry Kleinman, filming the 
       wedding -- would you like to say 
       something to Jordan and Naomi?

                 RUGRAT / ABBY
       Good luck!  We love you!

Across the way, Naomi spots someone through the crowd--

                 NAOMI
       Omigod!  Aunt Emma!

Naomi rushes over, hugs her AUNT EMMA, 50s, demure, 
British.  Naomi turns, calls out to Jordan, who is now in 
a huddle with the guys, his back to her.



                 NAOMI 
       Jordan!  Look!

Jordan turns, then crosses to them, smiling.  

                 AUNT EMMA
       Jordan dear, how lovely.  

                 JORDAN
       Its so nice to see you again. 

As he leans in to hug her, Aunt Emma spots some white 
powder on the edge of Jordans nostril.  Deftly, she 
wipes it off, smiling.  

                 AUNT EMMA 
       Into the donuts, I see. 

                 JORDAN
       Oh, Im--- uh...

Aunt Emma leans in to his ear.

                 AUNT EMMA
       I lived through the 60s, my dear.  
       Enjoy the day.  

And with that, she turns back to Naomi. 


EXT. BAHAMAS - MARINA - DAY  (DEC 92) 

With Naomi wearing a blindfold, Jordan leads her to the 
end of a long dock, expensive yachts moored everywhere.  

                 JORDAN
       Careful now.  You ready?

Jordan removes her blindfold -- there, towering above the 
others, is a stunning, 120 foot yacht.

                 NAOMI
       What is this?

                 JORDAN
       Your wedding present.  Check out 
       the name.

She does; its called Naomi.  As she squeals, hugs him-

                 JORDAN 
       For three weeks we sailed the 
       Naomi through the Caribbean--

INT. YACHT NAOMI - DAY  (DEC 92)


The camera PUSHES IN past a white-jacketed STEWARD,    
who opens the door to the yachts main salon; next we see   
the living room, with its full bar and leather couches; 
then the bedroom, with a king bed and monogrammed sheets. 

                 JORDAN 
       --eventually taking her home to 
       Long Island, where wed bought a 
       house.


EXT. CARIBBEAN - OPEN OCEAN - DAY  (DEC 92 - JAN 93)



The Naomi sails the calm waters, Jordan and Naomi popping 
ludes, sunbathing blissfully on the deck.    

                 JORDAN 
       Seven acres on the Gold Coast of 
       Long Island--

EXT./INT. JORDANS ESTATE - DAY  (APR 93)



Various shots -- the massive house; the glistening pool; 
waterfall; fountains; tennis court; driving range; 
gazebo; gym; sauna; library; media room. 

                 JORDAN 
       --the most expensive real estate 
       in the world, with maids, cooks, 
       landscapers, you name it.  


WE SEE the household STAFF lined up outside the house. 


                 JORDAN 
       We even had two guards who worked 
       in shifts, both named Rocco.  

INT. JORDANS ESTATE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY (FEB 95)


Amid billowing piles of white Chinese silk, Jordan sleeps 
on his back, snoring blissfully.  

                 JORDAN 
       It  was heaven on earth.

On screen WE SEE:              

18 MONTHS LATER

Splash!  A glass of water hits him in the face.   

                 NAOMI
       Wake up, you bag of shit!

Soaking wet, Jordan sits upright to see Naomi standing 
over him in a tiny pink chemise, holding an empty glass.  

                 JORDAN
       The fuck are you doing?! 

                 NAOMI
       Whos Venice?
 
                JORDAN
       What?!
  
                NAOMI
       Who is she?!  Some little hooker 
       you fucked last night?

                 JORDAN
       What?  No!  Naomi!

And as Naomi storms off for a re-fill...

INT. HOTEL ROOM - THE NIGHT BEFORE  (FEB 95)

Jordan lies on the ground, hands tied with a lit candle 
up his ass. 

                 JORDAN
       Venice, where are you? 

VENICE, A Blue Chip Hooker, enters, pulls out a candle 
and straddles him. She drips wax on his back and pulls 
his hair.

INT. JORDANS ESTATE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY (FEB 95)


Back to scene.  Naomi holds another full glass, rocking 
back and forth on the balls of her feet like a fighter. 



                 NAOMI
       You were calling her name in your 
       sleep!

                 JORDAN
       I can explain everything.

                 NAOMI
       Go ahead.  More lies from the man 
       who lies for a living!

                 JORDAN 
       No, really.  Donnie and me, were 
       investing in a condo development 
       in Venice. 

                 NAOMI
       Italy?!

                 JORDAN
       California, baby.


                 NAOMI
       Yeah, right.

                 JORDAN
       Duchess, come on.  

                 NAOMI
       Dont Duchess me, you scumbag.  
       You think I dont know what youre 
       up to?  Youre a father now and 
       you act like an infant!

Splash!  She nails him again, crosses for more water.  

                 JORDAN
       Fuck. Naomi!  Why are you so mad? 

                 NAOMI
       Where do you want me to start?  
       How about you flying in here on 
       your stupid helicopter at three in 
       the morning waking up Skylar?! 

EXT. JORDANS ESTATE - YARD - NIGHT  (FEB 95) 

Jordan crash-lands the helicopter on the driving range.  
He exits, gives Captain Dave a salute, fights his way 
through the bushes, then stumbles toward the house and 
falls into the pool, stoned out of his skull.  Security 
floodlights come on and the alarm sounds.

                 NAOMI 
       Does it even matter to you that I 
       just had that driving range sodded 
       with Bermuda grass? 


INT. JORDANS ESTATE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY (FEB 95)

Back to scene.  Naomi holds another glass of water. 

                 NAOMI
       But why should you give a shit? 
       You're not the one who researched 
       the fucking thing and dealt with 
       the fucking golf course people!  

                 JORDAN
       Youre an aspiring landscape 
       architect?!  But what happened to 
       wine connoisseur?  Oh wait, that 
       was last month!



                 NAOMI
       Fuck you!  

Naomi winds up with the water glass.  Jordan stands tall, 
puffs himself up, arms flexed at his sides. 

                 NAOMI 
       Stop flexing your arms, you look 
       like a fucking imbecile.
           (re: his crotch)
       And dont think that impresses me 
       much.

Jordan looks down: he has a morning erection.

                 JORDAN
       I wasn't flexing my arms.  You're 
       just lucky to have a husband who's 
       in such great shape.  Now get over 
       here and kiss me!



                 NAOMI
       Kiss you?!

Splash!  She nails him one last time, then storms out.  
He stands there dripping wet.  To his erection:

                 JORDAN
       Where the fuck were you last 
       night?

                 JORDAN 
       My morning ritual.  First Id get 
       up and fight with Naomi about 
       whatever I did the night before. 



INT. JORDANS ESTATE - STEAM SHOWER - DAY 



Jordan stands in the steaming shower.

                 JORDAN 
       Next it was a steam so I could 
       sweat out whatever drugs were 
       still in my system.


INT. JORDANS ESTATE - MASTER BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS



Jordan looks at himself in the mirror.  His eyes are 
bloodshot - he looks like shit.

                 JORDAN 
       After that Id assess the damage.

Jordan looks at a Visine bottle - Recommended Dosage - 
Two Drops. He squirts six drops in each eye. 

                 JORDAN 
       What kind of maniac abuses eye 
       drops? 

INT. JORDANS ESTATE - DRESSING ROOM - DAY (FEB 95)

Fully dressed and standing amid hundreds of suits, Jordan 
pops two white pills, swigs some juice. 

                 JORDAN 
       Then Id get dressed, take my 
       back pills to get me started, 
       then attempt to make up with her.

INT. JORDANS ESTATE - SKYLARS ROOM - DAY (FEB 95)


Jordan enters the tiny pink wonderland.  On the fluffy 
pink carpet is Naomi, now in a minidress hiked above her 
hips, Manolo Blahniks showing polished red toes.  Between 
her legs sits SKYLAR, their 5-month-old daughter. 



                 JORDAN
       Hey, Skylar.  

                 NAOMI
           (little girl voice)
       Good morning Daddy.  Wheres my 
       kiss?

Jordan kisses the baby, picks her up.  

                 JORDAN
           (playing along)
       Does Daddy get to kiss both his 
       girls?

                 NAOMI
       Ohhh, no!  Daddy doesn't even get  
       to touch Mommy for a very, very 
       long time.  

Naomi lays back on her elbows, thighs parted - shes 
wearing no panties.  The wind goes out of Jordan.

                 JORDAN
       Cmon, Nay, please.  You know how 
       sorry I am.  I swear I--

                 NAOMI
           (cutting him off)
       Daddy shouldnt waste his time.  
       And from now on it's going to be 
       nothing but short, short skirts 
       around the house!  And Mommys    
       so sick and tired of wearing 
       panties, uhhh.  In fact shes 
       decided to throw them all away.
           (parting her thighs)
       So take a good look.  Youll be 
       seeing an awful lot of it around 
       the house, but no touching.  

She licks her lips seductively.  Jordan sets Skylar 
aside, starts grovelling. 

                 NAOMI 
       Whats wrong, Daddy?

Naomi slips her index finger in her mouth, starts sucking 
it.  Jordan can barely speak.

                 JORDAN
       Cmon, why are you doing this?    
       I said Im sorry.

                 NAOMI
           (pouting)
       Ohhhh poor, poor Dada. He loves to 
       say how wrong he is when hes 
       ready to come in his own pants. 
       Isnt that right Dada? Mommy loves 
       Daddy so, so much and theres 
       nothing she wants to do more right 
       now than to make love to Daddy all 
       day long. Well, I guess its time 
       for Daddy to be taught his first 
       lesson.  


Naomi runs her fingers over her stomach and on to her 
inner thigh, then up toward her vagina.  Jordan watches 
transfixed, then a change comes over him... 

                 JORDAN
       I wouldnt do that if I were you 
       Mommy. I think Mommy should hear a 
       story before she decides to please 
       herself like that.
       Can Daddy tell Mommy a story?
           (off her nod)
       And does mommy promise to keep her 
       legs spread wide, wide open the 
       whole time?
           (she nods dreamily)
       Good.  Once upon a time there was 
       a great big mansion in Long Island 
       and the people who lived there had 
       lots and lots of money.  But of 
       all the possessions they had, 
       there was one thing that was much 
       more valuable than all the rest 
       combined, and that was their 
       little baby daughter.  

Naomi listens, legs still spread, hand on her crotch. 

                 JORDAN 
       Now because he was very security-
       conscious, the Daddy hired two 
       full-time guards, big hairy men 
       both named Rocco, and they 
       installed security cameras all 
       around the house.  And one of 
       those cameras is right over 
       Daddy's shoulder.

Naomis eyes widen -- she look toward a Teddy Bear on a 
shelf.  WE SEE that one of the eyes is a pinhole camera. 

                 JORDAN 
       So smile, Mommy!  You're on Candid 
       Camera!

INT. JORDANS ESTATE - GUARD HOUSE - DAY  (FEB 95)

Mesmerized, ROCCO DAY watches a video screen, on which we 
see a grainy image of Naomi, hand between her legs. 


INT. JORDANS ESTATE - SKYLARS BEDROOM - DAY (FEB 95)


Naomi jumps up as if shes been electrocuted. 



                 NAOMI
       You asshole!  

As she bolts from the room, Jordan plays with Skylar...

                 JORDAN 
       The good thing about living with  
       a world-class ballbreaker is they 
       make all the other ballbreakers in 
       your life a little easier to take. 

INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - OUTSIDE JORDANS OFFICE - DAY 
(FEB 95)

Donnie stands talking with Jordans assistant, Janet.  
Jordan approaches under a head of steam.



                 DONNIE 
       There he is.

                 JORDAN
           (a quick hug; then)
       Steve here yet?   

                 DONNIE
       On his way.  Very excited.

                 JORDAN
       Good.  Cuz we have a problem.

He indicates out to the Bullpen.  Donnie and Janet look.

                 JANET
           (incredulous)
       Is he wearing a bow tie?

In the Bullpen WE SEE a young Stratton Broker in a bowtie 
cleaning a small goldfish bowl on his desk.  

                 JORDAN
       Hes got nothing better to do on 
       the day of the biggest IPO in this 
       firms history?!  

Jordan watches as Donnie marches toward the Broker in a 
bowtie... 

INT. BULLPEN - CONTINUOUS   



                 DONNIE 
       The fuck you doing?

                 BROKER IN A BOWTIE
           (bewildered)
       Cleaning my fishbowl.  



                 DONNIE 
       Oh.  

Donnie nods, turns to go, but suddenly he turns back and 
thrusts his arm in the bowl, grabbing for the squirming 
goldfish.  The Broker in a bowtie looks on, horrified. 

                 DONNIE
       On new issue day?!  On 
       cocksucking, motherfucking      
       new issue day?!

Dozen of Brokers and Sales Assistants look over as Donnie 
snatches up the fish.  Holding it by its tail, he jumps 
up on the desk of the Broker in a bowtie.  Now the entire 
Bullpen looks over. 


                 DONNIE
       This is what happens when you fuck 
       with your pets on new issue day!

With the flair of a showman, Donnie pops the fish in his 
mouth, swallowing it whole.  The Brokers cheer wildly.  
Donnie jumps down, gets in the face of the Broker in a 
bowtie:

                 DONNIE
       Now take your bowtie, get your 
       shit and get the fuck out! 

Bowtie is stunned.  And as Donnie storms off, we PUSH IN 
on Jordan, watching from across the room.

INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - JORDANS OFFICE - DAY     
(FEB 95)  

Jordan finishes a phone call as Donnie enters with STEVE 
MADDEN, 30s, dressed in wrinkled navy blazer, cargo pants 
and T-shirt, a baseball cap over his scraggly, thinning 
hair.  Jordan smiles, crosses to greet him.

                 JORDAN
       The Cobbler.  Ready to get rich?  
       Hey buddy.

                 STEVE MADDEN
And as they ad lib greetings, settle in at the couch:

                 JORDAN 
       Steve Madden, the shoe designer, 
       was a childhood friend of 
       Donnies, but I didnt hold that 
       against him.  Remember those ads, 
       those giant-headed girls with bug 
       eyes wearing those big clunky 
       shoes?  


INSERT - a quick series of Steve Madden ads.

                 JORDAN 
       He came to me a few years earlier 
       when he was just starting out, so 
       I became a silent partner in his 
       company, buying an 85% stake for 
       only a million bucks.  


INT. STEVE MADDEN SHOES - DAY 



WE SEE various stores, all packed with teenage GIRLS 
buying shoes and boots.

                 JORDAN 
       The company blew up and we were 
       now taking it public.  It was the 
       biggest deal wed ever done and 
       the hottest IPO on Wall Street. 


INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - JORDANS OFFICE - DAY     
(FEB 95)


Jordan and Donnie sit with Steve Madden in mid-
conversation.

                 DONNIE
       --which is why they need to meet 
       you.  

                 JORDAN
       You gotta get em fired up so 
       theyll push the shit out of this 
       stock.   

                 DONNIE
       Let them feel your passion.


INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - BULLPEN - DAY  (FEB 95)


Bustling with activity.  With Jordan and Donnie looking 
on from nearby, Steve Madden approaches a microphone on 
the raised platform, in his hands several shoe boxes. 

                 STEVE MADDEN
           (into mic)
       Uhhh... excuse me... 

The place slowly comes to order.  

                 STEVE MADDEN 
       For those of you who don't know 
       me, my name is Steve Madden. I'm --

                 ONE BROKER
       We know who you are!  



Steve clears his throat, looks over at Jordan -- hes  
terrified.  Jordan motions for him to calm down.

                 STEVE MADDEN 
       I uh, I'd like to start by telling 
       you about my background in the 
       shoe industry.  

                 ANOTHER BROKER
       Nice fucking hat!

                 STEVE MADDEN
       I uh... first started working in 
       the shoe industry, in a shoe 
       store.  When I was sixteen, my 
       friends were out chasing girls, 
       but I was learning about women's 
       shoes. 

        KALIL
	Move the mike closer.

	PETER DEBLASIO 
	We cant fucking hear you!

He moves the mic; feedback SCREECHES through the bullpen. 

                 STEVE MADDEN 
       Sorry...  Anyway, my first job  
       was at a shoe store like I said 
       where I worked in the stockroom.  
       You know, I can honestly say Ive 
       been a lover of women's shoes 
       since I was twelve--



                 BROKER #4
       Freak!

                 STEVE MADDEN
       No.  Heh-heh.  Not like that.      
       I mean somehow I became fascinated 
       with the endless design 
       possibilities for women's shoes--

       BROKER #5
	Queer!

	BROKER #6
	Get a fucking life!

Boos, hisses.  Steve looks at Jordan, who motions for him 
to speed up.  He grabs a shoe from one of the boxes.

                 STEVE MADDEN 
       This shoe -- the Mary Lou -- is 
       the one that really put me on the 
       map.  Its a black patent leather  
       variation of the Mary Jane, but--

SPLAT! A half-eaten grapefruit lands at Steves feet.   
In a flash, Jordan rushes over, grabs the mic--


                 JORDAN
       All right, let's hear it for Steve 
       Madden and the wonderful Mary Lou!

Huge applause, with stomping feet; howling, etc.

                 JORDAN 
       Okay, now that you got that out  
       of your system, I want you to know 
       why Steve is so completely off the 
       fucking wall... Its because this 
       man is a creative genius.  Steve's 
       power, his gift -- is that he 
       creates trends.  Artists like 
       Steve come along once a century!  
       Elvis!  Andy Warhol!   Giorgio 
       Armani!  Who knows how high this 
       stock could go?  The 20s?  The 
       50s?  The 80s?

Applause; war whoops.  Jordan motions for quiet.

                 JORDAN 
       I want everybody to look down.   
       See that little black box in front 
       of you?  It's called a telephone. 
       Now I'm gonna let you in on a 
       little secret about this  
       telephone -- it won't dial itself!  
       Thats right -- until you take 
       some action, it's nothing more 
       than a worthless hunk of plastic, 
       like a loaded M16 without a 
       trained Marine to pull the 
       trigger.  And in the case of the 
       telephone, it's the action of you, 
       a highly trained Strattonite, a 
       killer who will not take no for an 
       answer!   A person who will not 
       hang up the phone until his client 
       either buys or fucking dies!  

The Brokers go crazy.  Jordan looks around. 

                 JORDAN 
       I don't care if you graduated from 
       Harvard or Bumfuck University or 
       never got past fourth fucking 
       grade!  That phone is the great 
       equalizer! 
           (pause; looks around)
       There is no nobility in poverty. 
       I've been rich, and I've been poor  
       and I choose rich every time. 


                 JORDAN 
       At least as a rich man, when I 
       have to face my problems, I show 
       up in the back of a limo wearing a 
       $2000 suit and $40,000 gold watch! 

Jordan takes off his GOLD WATCH, flings it to the Crowd.  
Brokers go nuts, fighting over it like a home-run ball.  

                 JORDAN 
       And if anyone here thinks I'm 
       crazy, get the fuck out and get a 
       job at McDonalds, because that's 
       where you fucking belong! But 
       before you depart this room full 
       of winners, I want you to take a 
       good look at the person next to 
       you, because one day in the not-so-
       distant future, you'll be sitting 
       at a red light in your beat-up old 
       Pinto, and that persons gonna 
       pull up in a brand new Porsche, 
       with their gorgeous young wife at 
       their side. And who will you be 
       next to?  Some ugly beast with 
       three days of razor-stubble in a 
       sleeveless moo-moo, crammed in 
       next to you with a carload of 
       groceries from the fucking Price 
       Club!

He scans the Brokers; theyre on the edge of their seats.  

                 JORDAN 
       So you listen to me and listen 
       carefully.  Are you behind on your 
       credit card bills?  Good.  Pick up 
       the phone and start dialing.  Is 
       your landlord threatening to evict 
       you?  Good.  Pick up the phone and 
       start dialing.  Does your 
       girlfriend think you're a fucking 
       loser?  Pick up the phone and 
       start fucking dialing!  I want  
       you to deal with your problems by 
       becoming rich!  I want you to go 
       out and spend money!  Leverage 
       yourself, back yourself into a 
       corner, let the consequences of 
       failure become so fucking 
       unthinkable that you'll have no 
       choice but to do whatever it takes 
       to win!  

The Brokers go absolutely APESHIT.  


                 JORDAN 
       You have an obligation here, 
       people!  To your clients!  To this 
       firm!  An obligation to yourself, 
       godammit!  You ram Steve Madden 
       stock down your clients throats   
       and make them choke on it till 
       they buy 20,000 shares!  Be 
       aggressive!  Be ferocious!  Be 
       telephone fucking terrorists!!  

Before Jordan is even finished, the Brokers GO BERSERK, 
some already dialing their phones.  

                 JORDAN  
       At 1 p.m. we opened the stock for 
       sale at $4.50 a share.  By 1:03   
       it was over eighteen dollars.

INT. FBI OFFICES - MANHATTAN - DAY

Agent Denham exits the elevator, arriving for work.  He 
strides between cubicles, briefcase in hand.  He enters --

INT. AGENT DENHAMS OFFICE - DAY

-- where pinned up on one wall is a massive chart on 
Strattons operations: pictures of Jordan, Donnie and 
others, a hierarchy, a history, an investigation...


INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - BULLPEN - LATER (FEB 95)

Total sales frenzy.  The CAMERA PANS the 300 Brokers, who 
work the phones like mad. 

       SEA OTTER
	--the hottest new issue on 
	Wall Street!

	YOUNG BROKER 
	--up two dollars while Im 
	talking to you!

And as we continue PANNING the room...

                 JORDAN  
       Of course I couldnt have done 
       this without help.  Id leaked the 
       word on Wall Street that Stratton 
       was a buyer up until twenty.  So 
       not only were we pushing Madden, 
       all the big firms were too.

We continue PANNING the frenzied Brokers...

                 JORDAN 
       As long as they knew Id buy the 
       shares back at the top of the 
       market, theyd drive the price   
       up as high as I fucking wanted.


INT. JORDANS OFFICE - DAY  (FEB 95)

Donnie pours champagne nearby, oblivious to Jordan, who 
sits at his desk, speaking directly to camera:

                 JORDAN
       Of the two million shares being 
       offered for sale, a million 
       belonged to me, held in phony 
       accounts by my ratholes.  Once the 
       price hit the high teens, I-- 

Jordan abruptly stops.  A beat, then: 

                 JORDAN 
       Like I said before, who gives a 
       shit?  As always, the point is 
       this-- 

BACK TO SCENE -- Donnie hands Jordan a glass of Dom.  

                 DONNIE
       22 million in three fucking hours! 

They toast, then each pop ludes, which they wash down 
with champagne.  A quick knock; Janet pops her head in.

                 JORDAN
       Janet, baby.  Drink.  

                 JANET
       Call for you.  Barry Kleinman from 
       Future Video?

                 JORDAN
       Who?

	            JANET
       He filmed your wedding.  He says 
       its urgent.

Curious, Jordan leans over, hits the speaker phone:


                 JORDAN
       Barry?


INT. FUTURE VIDEO - DAY  (FEB 95) 


Barry Kleinman sits at his desk, talking on the phone.

                 BARRY KLEINMAN
       Jordan, hey.  Listen, I got a 
       subpoena.  The FBI wants a copy  
       of your wedding video.  

On Jordan.  Uh-oh.

                 JORDAN 
       The F-B-fucking-I?

INT. FIRING RANGE - DAY

Wearing goggles and protective headphones, square-jawed 
FBI Agent Patrick Denham takes target practice.

                 BO DIETL  
       Names Denham, hes an agent in 
       the New York office.

                 JORDAN 
       Whats his problem?

                 BO DIETL 
       Hes a boy scout, thinks youre 
       Gordon Gekko. 

EXT. RAOS - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING (MAR 95)

INT. RAOS RESTAURANT - NIGHT (MAR 95)

The East Harlem institution.  Jordan sits across a table 
over pasta with private investigator BO DIETL, 40s.  

                 JORDAN
       But my goddamn wedding video?

                 BO DIETL
       Got your whole inner circle in one 
       place, faces and names. Hes 
       hoping it rattles you, or maybe 
       your wife, so that she starts 
       nagging you to turn witness. 

                 JORDAN
           (thats laughable)
       What? He wants me to rat on 
       myself?


                 BO DIETL
           (shrugs)
       Good news is I made some calls, 
       DEA, Justice?  No one but him even 
       knows who you are. 

                 JORDAN
       Can you bug him or something, tap 
       his phone?

                 BO DIETL
       Jordan, relax.  First off, you 
       dont fuck with these guys, not 
       that way.  Secondly, I got a P.I. 
       license, you know?

                 JORDAN
       Maybe I should call him, see what 
       he wants.  

                 BO DIETL
       No! Anybody does that should be 
       your lawyer. What you do is eat 
       your dinner, drink your drink, and 
       forget about it. Cuz as far as I 
       hear he doesnt have shit.  



Jordan nods, wheels turning, pretending to do as told.  

EXT. BATTERY PARK MARINA - DAY (LATE SPRING 95)  

As Agent Denham steps into frame, another FED, AGENT 
HUGHES, beside him, both G-man stoic in impenetrably dark 
glasses --

                 JORDAN 
       Patrick? Hey! Cmon aboard!

They look up. On the yacht Naomi, Jordan stands waving, 
drinking wine with two Blue Chip HOOKERS in bikinis. 

                 JORDAN 
       Planks right down there.

Denham shares a look with his cohort: its almost a joke, 
this display of wealth before a federal agent. Moments 
later, they step aboard.

                 AGENT DENHAM
       Mr. Belfort, Im Agent Denham.  
       This is Agent Hughes.

                 JORDAN
       Heya! This is Nicole and, 
       um...Heidi. Girls, Patrick and...? 

                 AGENT DENHAM
       Agents Denham and Hughes. Your 
       message said you wanted to speak 
       privately. 

                 JORDAN 
       It did. I do.
           (off Denhams stare)
       Oh, theyre just friends.
           (to the girls)
       Give us a minute, okay?

The Hookers head below deck. Jordan shoots Denham a wink-- 
check out that ass!

                 JORDAN 
       Can I get a glass? Got wine open 
       or any kinda booze. Shrimp and 
       lobsterre over there if youre 
       hungry.

                 AGENT DENHAM
       Bureau forbids us from drinking at 
       sea.

Jordan surprised: the guy has a sense of humor. 

                 JORDAN
       I have something for you, I just 
       gotta find it. Have a seat, will 
       ya? Ever been on one of these 
       before?

As Jordan rifles through some papers, Denhams eyes scan 
the deck, casually cataloguing everything.

                 AGENT DENHAM
       A boat? Learned to sail when I was 
       six.

                 JORDAN
       I mean, one like this. Just had 
       her extended to put a chopper on 
       the back.

Jordan points out the Bell-Jet helicopter. 

                 AGENT DENHAM
       Never been on a boat with a second 
       mode of transportation on top of 
       it. 

Jordan finds the file hes been looking for, offers it. 


                 AGENT DENHAM 
           (before hell accept)
       What is this?

                 JORDAN
       Names and addresses of every guest 
       at my wedding. Friends, clients. I 
       even threw in the seating chart. 
       Heard thats why you wanted the 
       video, figured thisd expedite 
       whatever it is youre doing.
           (Denham looks: its 
            indeed a guest list 
            from the wedding)
       I wanted to show you Ive got 
       nothing to hide. I know youre 
       investigating Stratton but for the 
       life of me I cant figure out why. 
       Sure, my company is unorthodox; 
       what brokerage isnt? Maybe were 
       a little louder than most but we 
       dont do anything illegal. Talk to 
       the SEC, theyll tell you, they 
       checked us out up and down.

                 AGENT DENHAM
       The SECs actually a civil 
       regulatory agency. We pursue 
       criminal activity.

                 JORDAN
       Thats what Im saying. You guys 
       take on real crime. Which is why 
       Im so curious: what do you think 
       we did?

The reason Jordan asked him here, Denham realizes.

                 AGENT DENHAM
       I cant discuss ongoing 
       investigations. 


                 JORDAN
       I understand.

                 AGENT DENHAM
       Though, to be frank, this case 
       kinda got dumped on my desk. Some 
       higher-up felt your shop needed 
       looking into after all that press, 
       fell on me to do the looking. 

                 JORDAN
       You know who you should be looking 
       at? Goldman, Lehman Brothers, 
       Merrill. 


                 JORDAN 
       What those guysre up to with 
       collateralized debt obligations? 
       This internet stock bullshit? 
       Cmon. If you want, Ill walk you 
       through exactly --

                 AGENT DENHAM
       -- thatd be great. And if theres 
       anything you can give me just to 
       close out your file, get it off my 
       desk--

                 JORDAN
       -- sure, get you back to the real 
       criminals --

                 AGENT DENHAM
       -- then we could both profit from 
       this little sit-down.

Jordan sizes him up: what did Denham mean by profit?

                 JORDAN
       You sure you dont want anything 
       to drink? Water for your pal?
           (Denham demurs)
       Rumor is your started out in 
       finance. Even got your brokers 
       license before you joined the 
       bureau.

                 AGENT DENHAM
       Who told you that?

                 JORDAN
           (searches his memory)
       Jeez, who was it...?
           (comes up short)
       Ever regret it? Giving up the 
       money-crazed, pin-striped life? 
       Ever think where youd be if youd 
       stuck with it?

                 AGENT DENHAM 
       When Im riding the subway home, 
       sweating my balls off, in a suit 
       Ive worn three days, sure.

                 JORDAN
       Whattaya pull in working at the 
       bureau, if you dont mind me 
       asking. 50-60K a year?

                 AGENT DENHAM
       Just about. We get a free handgun 
       out of it, though, that doesnt 
       suck.

                 JORDAN
       Scrazy, the world we live in, the 
       jobs with real value, the ones we 
       should appreciate -- firefighters, 
       teachers, FBI agents -- those are 
       the ones we pay the least.

                 AGENT DENHAM 
       Way of the world. 

                 JORDAN
       Thats one thing I like about what 
       I do, the opportunity to make that 
       right. Take this kid we had 
       interning last year. Didnt want 
       to be a broker, wanted to be an 
       environmental scientist or 
       something, he had a student loan 
       debts up to his eyeballs. Anyway, 
       his mom gets sick, all they can 
       afford is third-rate care. Some of 
       us got together, made an 
       investment on his behalf and -- 
       boom -- overnight everything 
       changes, shes seeing the best 
       doctors in the country. Sadly, 
       didnt work out, she passed but 
       still: having the power to do that 
       makes all the other bullshit worth 
       while.
           (as Denham considers 
            that)
       See, its all about proper 
       guidance, Pat. Knowing someone 
       with the right relationships, 
       whos discreet. I can change a 
       life almost every day.

They measure each other.

                 AGENT DENHAM
       How much that intern make off your 
       deal?

                 JORDAN
       North of half a million.

Denham summons Agent Hughes over. To Jordan:

                 AGENT DENHAM
       Can you say that again, what you 
       told me?
           (Jordan declines with 
            a smile; to Agent 
            Hughes)
       I believe Mr. Belfort just tried 
       to bribe a federal officer.


                 JORDAN
       What? I was making conversation.

                 AGENT DENHAM
       Sounds like that to me, Jordan.

                 JORDAN
       ...no, no, no...

                 AGENT DENHAM
       ...sounded like that...

                 JORDAN
       ...no, to constitute a bribe, 
       dont I have to make an explicit 
       offer of money for services? With 
       an exact dollar figure attached? 
       All I said was north of half a 
       million. According to the U.S. 
       Criminal Code, that dog wont 
       hunt, Pat.
           (then)
       Heard you were a straight arrow. 
       That you wouldnt bend the rules 
       other agents might. He was right.

                 AGENT DENHAM
       You did a background check on me?

                 JORDAN
       Figured you were looking into me, 
       was only fair. Plus you sail on a 
       yacht fit for a Bond villain, 
       sometimes you gotta act the part. 

                 AGENT DENHAM
       This is why you invited me down to 
       your yacht? With a couple hookers 
       on it --

                 JORDAN
       -- those are friends --

                 AGENT DENHAM
       -- to get a sense of the guy who 
       was coming after you?

Jordan puts his hands up: you got me.

                 JORDAN
       Thanks for coming down. Now get 
       off my boat.

                 AGENT DENHAM
       You know, most of the Wall Street 
       jackasses I bust, they were born 
       to the life. 

                 AGENT DENHAM 
       Their father was a douchebag 
       before them, and his father before 
       that. But you, you got this way 
       all on your own. Good for you, 
       Jordan.
           (as he starts to go)
       Thank you for having us. Im 
       absolutely certain well see each 
       other again.
           (before he does)
       You know, this is about the nicest 
       boat Ive ever been on. Just think 
       what a hero Ill be in the office 
       when the bureau seizes it. 

Jordan watches him go, temper flaring: he cant let 
Denham get the final word. He calls after them:

                 JORDAN
       Hey, Denham! Im gonna eat a claw 
       of lobster now as I get my cock 
       sucked by Heidi down below. You 
       have a super ride home on the 
       subway thinking about that!

As he watches them pull away, seething --


                 JORDAN 
       He was a numbers guy, a follow-the-
       fucking-moneyer.  He wasnt gonna 
       come at me through my guys, 
       looking for a weak link and a 
       quick kill.  He was gonna come at 
       me like an accountant would, the 
       way Ness got Capone, through my 
       books.  Which meant?  It was ass-
       covering time.


INT. JORDANS ESTATE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY  (SUMMER 95)



As Naomi looks on, 5 months pregnant, Jordan packs a 
suitcase.

                 NAOMI
       Switzerland?  What the fuck is in 
       Switzerland?

                 JORDAN
       Swiss cheese, Naomi, what do you 
       fucking think?


INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY   
(SUMMER 95)



Jordan sits talking with Rugrat and Donnie.

                 JORDAN 
       Rugrat set up a meeting with a 
       Swiss Banker he knew from law 
       school who could launder our 
       money, but it wasnt till noon  
       the next day.

Jordan glances at his watch, washes down a few ludes.

                 JORDAN 
       I knew if I timed my lude intake 
       right, Id sleep through the 
       entire overnight flight.



INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - BULLPEN - DAY (SUMMER 95)

Jordan stands before the Bullpen talking to his Brokers.

                 JORDAN 
       At four p.m. I popped a few ludes, 
       which started kicking in by the 
       time I finished our sales meeting.  
       This was the tingle phase.    



INT. CANASTELS - NIGHT  (SUMMER 95)

Over dinner, a visibly high Jordan ravenously digs into 
his food as Donnie and four Blue Chip Hookers look on.

                 JORDAN   
       By dinner I popped a few more on 
       top of some cocktails and an 
       valium or two.  The slur phase. 


INT. DANCE CLUB - NIGHT  (SUMMER 95)

On the crowded dance floor, Jordan gets knocked around 
like a marionette, saliva strung from his mouth. 

                 JORDAN 
       By eight thirty Id done a few 
       more and pretty much lost my motor 
       skills.  This was the drool phase. 



INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT (SUMMER 95) 

Jordan is barely conscious as a Hooker rides him.

                 JORDAN  
       And by ten I didnt know who or 
       what I was doing -- the amnesia 
       phase.  We boarded the plane just 
       before midnight.

INT. ZURICH AIRLINES - FIRST CLASS - NIGHT (SUMMER 95)

Jordan boards, slurring, drooling, completely wasted.   

                 JORDAN
           (to a Stewardess)
       Sweetheart!  Look at you!

And as he hugs her, then stumbles toward his seat...


INT. ZURICH AIRLINES - FIRST CLASS - DAY (SUMMER 95) 


Quiet; morning sunlight bleeds through the window.  
Jordans eyes flicker open.  He yawns, looks around, 
tries to get up; he cant move.  He looks down, sees   
six seat belts restraining his arms and legs.  Jordan 
looks over at Donnie, mouth agape, asleep next to him.

                 JORDAN 
       Donnie.  Donnie, wake up.



                 DONNIE
       Nuuhh?

                 JORDAN
       Untie me, shitbag.  You think this 
       is funny?

                 DONNIE
       I didnt tie you, the captain did.  
       He almost tasered you.  

                 JORDAN
       Why?

FLASHBACK -- 

As PASSENGERS scream, Jordan wildly humps a STEWARDESS, 
the CAPTAIN struggling to restrain him. 

                 JORDAN  
       This was fucking great.  I hadnt 
       laundered a dime yet and already  
       I was under arrest.  


INT. ZURICH AIRLINES - FIRST CLASS - DAY (SUMMER 95)



A pensive Jordan sits, mind racing. 

                 JORDAN 
       Worse yet was the plastic baggie 
       of ludes that Donnied stuffed up 
       his ass.


Jordan trades looks with Donnie, who shifts 
uncomfortably. 

                 JORDAN 
       But before he could even get a 
       hemorrhoid--

INT. GENEVA AIRPORT - CUSTOMS OFFICE - DAY 


Jordan sits with two CUSTOMS OFFICERS.  

                 JORDAN  
       --the whole thing was quashed by 
       our friend the Swiss banker. Which 
       was lucky for me, since so far Id 
       been able to keep Agent Fuckface 
       unaware of the trip.

Another CUSTOMS OFFICER enters, whispers something to the 
others.  They shake Jordans hand and he leaves.



EXT. GENEVA - SHOPPING DISTRICT - DAY (SUMMER 95)

A limo pulls up at an office building.  Jordan emerges 
with Rugrat and Donnie.


INT. BANQUE REAL DE GENEVE - LOBBY - DAY (SUMMER 95) 

JEAN-JACQUES SAUREL greets them. 30s, suave. The lobby is 
ultra-modernist.

                 SAUREL
       Jordan Belfort!  At last!  
       Nicholas has told me so much.

                 RUGRAT
       Jordan, Jean-Jacques Saurel.

                 JORDAN
       Nice to make your acquaintance.  
       This is some lobby you got.

                 SAUREL 
       Ah, yes.  We gave our designer an 
       unlimited budget and he exceeded 
       it.  Come!  You must tell me all 
       about your adventure with the 
       stewardess over coffee!

They disappear upstairs.


INT. BANQUE REAL DE GENEVE - SAURELS OFFICE - DAY    


Jordan, Rugrat and Donnie drink coffee with Saurel and 
one other SWISS BANKER.  Its an impressive office, with 
an enormous fish tank.


                 DONNIE
       We have a joke in America.  
       Heaven is a place where the 
       police are Brits, the chefs are 
       Italian, the car mechanics are 
       German, the prostitutes are French 
       and the bankers are Swiss.  I 
       never got it til now -- look at 
       those fucking fish!  Come here, 
       little guy...

                 SAUREL
       Yes, we have the same joke here.  
       Only sometimes the English are 
       chauffeurs and the chefs are 
       French.  The Germans, alas, are 
       always mechanics; no one wants to 
       grant them more authority than 
       that.

Polite laughter.  Jordan, not as impressed by the fish, 
cuts straight to the point:

                 JORDAN
       I'm curious about your bank 
       secrecy laws.

                 SAUREL
       Excusez-moi, Jordan, Swiss custom 
       requires ten minutes of idle chit-
       chat before business can be 
       discussed.
           (a smile)
       Of course, lets get down to it.  
       What would you like to know?

                 JORDAN
       Under what circumstances would you 
       be obligated to cooperate with an 
       FBI or U.S. Justice Department 
       investigation?



                 SAUREL
       Ca depend.
     
	            JORDAN
       Ca depend?  Ca depend on what?


                 SAUREL
       Whether America plans to invade 
       Switzerland in the coming months.

                 RUGRAT
       Want me to see if tanks are 
       rolling down the Rue de la Croix?

More chuckles.  Through Jordans forced smile:

                 JORDAN  
       What Im asking, you Swiss dick, 
       is are you going to fuck me over.

                 SAUREL  
       I understand perfectly, you 
       American shitheel.

Saurel smiles. 

                 SAUREL
       The only way the Banque Real de 
       Geneve would cooperate with a 
       foreign legal body is if the crime 
       being pursued also happened to be 
       a crime in Switzerland.  But there 
       are very few Swiss laws pertaining 
       to your rumored improprieties.  
       Which is why Mr. Azoffs joke is 
       most appropriate: from a financial 
       standpoint you are now in heaven, 
       and we welcome you.  If the U.S. 
       Justice Department or FBI or SEC 
       or IRS sent us a subpoena, it 
       would become papier-toillette.  We 
       would wipe our ass with it. 

Everyones impressed.  Except Jordan.

                 JORDAN 
       Unless it was an investigation 
       into stock fraud -- which is a 
       crime in Switzerland.  Then youd 
       have to cooperate.

                 SAUREL
           (now hes impressed)
       Yes, we would.  Assuming the 
       account is under your name.  
       However, if it were in the name of 
       a nominee of yours...

They take each other in.


                 JORDAN  
       Was that yodeling I just heard or 
       did you just say what I thought 
       you said?  

                 SAUREL 
       Yes!  Yes! 

As the meeting wraps up with handshakes, Jordans V.O. 
overwhelms Saurels V.O..  

                 JORDAN 
       He was telling me to use a 
       rathole.  Problem was: sneaking a 
       U.S. rathole into Switzerland was 
       a chance I couldnt take.  What I 
       needed was somebody with a 
       European passport.

EXT. LONDON FLAT - DAY (SUMMER 95)

Naomis Aunt Emma answers the door.


                 AUNT EMMA
       Jordan?

                 JORDAN
           (big smile, sweating)
       Surprise.

EXT. HYDE PARK - DAY  (SUMMER 95)

Amid towering trees and horse trails, a noticeably 
twitchy Jordan walks arm-in-arm with Aunt Emma.  

                 AUNT EMMA
       So tell me about this plan of 
       yours. 

                 JORDAN
       Id like us to go to Switzerland 
       tomorrow so you can open an 
       account.  Ill fund it, and Ill 
       pay you really well for your 
       trouble.  



                 AUNT EMMA
       Oh my. 


                 JORDAN
       Next month maybe you can fly to 
       New York and we can start moving 
       the cash.

                 AUNT EMMA
       Moving the cash.
           (smiles)
       I feel like a character in an   
       Ian Fleming novel.  Its all quite 
       racy, isnt it?

                 JORDAN
       It is, and its illegal too.  Of 
       course if you ever got in trouble, 
       Id come forward in two seconds, 
       say I duped you, but even still. 

                 AUNT EMMA
       Risk is what keeps us young, isnt 
       it darling?  

                 JORDAN
       I like that attitude. Promise me 
       youll spend at least ten thousand 
       pounds per month out of the 
       account, okay?

                 AUNT EMMA
           (chuckles)
       I wouldn't even know how.  I 
       really do have everything I need.  

                 JORDAN
       But I bet you don't have 
       everything you want.  How about a 
       bigger apartment so your grandkids 
       can sleep over? 


Aunt Emma notices that Jordan is sweating, fidgety.  Hes 
jonesing. 


                 AUNT EMMA
       Shall we sit?

                 JORDAN
       Sure, thatd be great.  

They sit on a nearby bench.  After a while:

                 AUNT EMMA
       Sometimes I wonder if you let 
       money get the best of you, dear.  
           (beat)
       Among other substances.

                 JORDAN
       Its that obvious, huh?

                 AUNT EMMA
       Its the height of summer and 
       youve got the chills.  

                 JORDAN
       Im a drug addict, Emma. Coke, 
       pills, you name it, whatever you 
       got. Sex addict too. 

                 AUNT EMMA
           (laughs)
       Well there are worse things to be 
       addicted to than sex. 

                 JORDAN
           (chuckles; then)
       Why did I just tell you that?

                 AUNT EMMA
           (playful)
       Because Im very easy to talk to.  

Jordan looks at her.  A few beats, then:

                 JORDAN
       As a matter of fact you are. My 
       job, you know, its tough. I mean 
       Im not complaining, its just the 
       stress. All these people depending 
       on me. Millions of dollars at 
       stake every day. I sometimes feel 
       Ive bitten off more than I can 
       chew.

                 AUNT EMMA
       Youre a man with large appetites. 

Jordan looks at her and smiles:

                 JORDAN 
       Is she fucking hitting on me?

                 JORDAN
       I agree. I put it on myself. Its 
       hard to control the anxiety, you 
       know? Its hard to learn to relax.

                 AUNT EMMA
       To release the tension.  

                 JORDAN 
       She is hitting on me!  Holy shit!

Jordan leans in closer, casually slips an arm around her. 

                 JORDAN
       Exactly, to release the tension. 
       Sometimes you gotta learn to do 
       what comes natural in life, huh?  

Aunt Emma pulls back slightly. 

                 AUNT EMMA 
       Is he fucking hitting on me?

He leans in even closer, kisses her, then:

                 AUNT EMMA
       Stability, dear.  Family.  

                 AUNT EMMA 
       You take care of my niece, my 
       love.  And Ill take care of 
       everything over here. 
           (a beat) 
       Ah, once upon a time...


INT. BEACH HOUSE - BEDROOM - SOUTH HAMPTON - DAY   
(SUMMER 95)



Jordan fucks Naomi.  Theres a curious thunk-thunk-thunk. 

                 JORDAN 
       When I got home, I realized there 
       was no way Aunt Emma could smuggle 
       that much cash by herself. I 
       racked my brain for another person 
       with a foreign passport.

The beds covered with bundles of cash.  Every thrust of 
Jordans, another bundle plummets to the floor -- thunk.

INT. BEACH HOUSE - SOUTH HAMPTON - GUEST BEDROOM - DAY 
(SUMMER 95) 

With $20 mil in CASH on the bed, Jordan and a stoned 
Donnie watch as Brad tapes stacks of cash to his wife 
CHANTALLE, a bombshell in panties, bra and sneakers. 

                 CHANTALLE
       Bra-had, theese tape eez focking 
       steeky!

As Brad keeps taping her up:

                 JORDAN  
       As a successful drug dealer, Brad  
       spent his winters in the South of 
       France, which is where he met his 
       wife Chantalle, a stripper of 
       Slovenian origin but born in, of 
       all places, Switzerland.  

                 CHANTALLE
       Take eet off, Bra-had!  Eet erts!

                 BRAD
       Shut up, bitch.

                 CHANTALLE
       You beetch, you focking douche-a-
       bag-a!

Donnie cant help but start laughing at this.

                 DONNIE
       Take eet off!  Take eet off!

Brad seethes at this but keeps taping...

INT. BEACH HOUSE - SOUTH HAMPTON - BEDROOM - LATER 
(SUMMER 95)


Chantalle is completely taped up, a cash-covered mummy.  
Jordan looks on with Brad, Donnie and now Naomi.  90% of 
the cash is still on the bed.

                 JORDAN
       Well, this is fucked.

                 NAOMI
       Its gonna take her like fifty 
       trips.  

                 BRAD
       Well get her parents to tape up 
       too.  They got Swiss passports.  
       Plus her brother and his wife.  
       Five people, six-seven trips?  

                 JORDAN
       How muchll they want for it?

                 BRAD
       I dunno, not much.  Fuck, theyd 
       probably do it just for the miles.

                 DONNIE
       What about my money?  


                 BRAD
       What?

                 DONNIE
       My money.  I got a few mil of my 
       own I wanna move.  Ill call you, 
       you can come pick it up.

                 BRAD
           (takes offense to 
            Donnies 
            presumption)
       Youll call me.

                 DONNIE
           (what part dont you 
            understand?)
       And you can come pick it up.

Brad asks Jordan if they can speak in private.  

MOMENTS LATER, IN PRIVATE: Jordan joins Brad.


                 JORDAN
       Whats wrong?

                 BRAD
       Dont make me deal with this 
       fucknut, okay?

                 JORDAN
       Donnie?  Hes just high is all.

                 BRAD
       I dunno if hes stupid or a junkie 
       but hes a loose fuckin cannon.  
       I dont trust him and I dont want 
       him around me.

                 JORDAN
       Jesus.  I thought he was your best 
       customer.

                 BRAD
       I only sell to him cuz hes your 
       friend.

                 JORDAN
       Can you just do one trip for him?

Brad stews.  Its asking a lot.

                 BRAD
       Ill meet him but I wont pick up.  
       I have a limit of how much of that 
       douchebag I can take.

                 DONNIE
       I can hear you, motherfucker!

Donnie emerges from where hes been eavesdropping.

                 DONNIE 
       Im a douchebag?!!  Well, whose 
       fucking idea was it made us all 
       this money?!!  Who fucking knew 
       Steve Madden?!!  This douchebag!!  
       So go fuck yourself a little!

Brad slaps Donnie so hard across the face he goes down.

                 JORDAN 
       The next day, Aunt Emma flew to 
       Geneva, two million in cash in her 
       carry-on.

INT. GENEVA AIRPORT - DAY  (SUMMER 95)

Wheeling a small carry-on suitcase, Aunt Emma smiles at a 
CUSTOMS AGENT, who waves her through.


                 JORDAN 
       Which in the big picture was a 
       drop in the Swiss bucket --

TIME CUT:


On another day, Chantalle and her family (PARENTS, 
BROTHER, his WIFE) pass through Customs, on vacation.


                 JORDAN 
       -- because the following month, 
       over the course of six round-
       trips, Chantalle and her family 
       smuggled in over twenty million 
       without even a hiccup.



INT. BANQUE REAL DE GENEVE - PRIVATE ROOM - DAY     
(SUMMER 95)


With a cash-filled suitcase on the table, Chantalle 
remembers a last fold of cash hidden inside her skirts 
lining.  She laughs with Saurel.  


EXT. STRIP MALL - PARKING LOT - LONG ISLAND - DAY    
(LATE SUMMER 95)



Brad waits by his Range Rover as Donnies Rolls careens 
into the lot.  He emerges, briefcase in hand.

                 DONNIE
       Fu Manchu!  Kung fu!

Donnie starts doing spastic karate moves.  Is he high?  
Sure looks like it.  Brad looks pissed, and Donnie starts 
laughing.  Actually hes dead sober.

                 DONNIE 
       Im just fucking with you, man.  
       Jesus, the look on your face.  
           (Brad isnt laughing)
       Hey, sorry if I got outta line the 
       other day, I was just, that was 
       the drugs talking...

                 BRAD
       Scool, just... gimme the case.

                 DONNIE
           (he doesnt)
       You know, I always kinda regretted 
       you didnt come to work with us at 
       Stratton.  Itd be so cool having 
       you around, man.

                 BRAD
           (growing impatient)
       Yeah, well...

                 DONNIE
       Youd be one of us, wed go out-
       partying together, you wouldnt 
       have to dress like a mall rat 
       guinea prison bitch all the time.

Donnie grins, obviously still smarting from Brads slap.  
Brad just wants to take the money and be done.

                 BRAD
       Give me the money.

A DISTANCE AWAY, a COP in a patrol car notices Brad 
gesturing to Donnie for his briefcase.  He nudges his 
partner: check this out.

                 DONNIE
       Can I come over and help tape this 
       to your wife?  Eez so focking 
       steeky!  Take eet off, Bra-hod!

Brad composes himself, lest he kill the guy.

                 BRAD
       Im gonna give you a pass.

                 DONNIE
       Youre what?

                 BRAD
       Im gonna give you a pass.

                 DONNIE
       Youre gonna give me a pass?

                 BRAD
       Yes.  Just gimme the money.

                 DONNIE
       Youre gonna give me a pass?  
       Okay... 
           (offers the case)
       Why dont you stick your pass up 
       your Slavic cunts pussy. 

That does it.  Brad attacks.  Donnie throws the case at 
him, which opens on impact, money spilling out.  Brad 
instinctively tries to contain it... and thats when the 
POLICE SIRENS start.  Here comes the patrol car.



                 BRAD
       Shit! 

Donnie bolts.  With no time to get to his car, Brad takes 
off on foot, bleeding briefcase in hand, toward a video 
store where he stashes his .38 in the return box.

                 POLICE
       Freeze!  Dont move!


Brad drops to his knees, briefcase at his feet.  From a 
distance, Donnie peers around a corner to watch him get 
arrested, knowing he fucked this up.


INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - DONNIES OFFICE - DAY              
(LATE SUMMER 95)


Donnie is seated at his desk, freaking out and trying to 
figure out what to do. He exits. 


INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - JORDANS OFFICE - DAY    
(LATE SUMMER 95)


With a flourish, Donnie presents a bottle full of ludes.


                 DONNIE
       Jord, do I have a surprise for 
       you. Twenty real lemons! A retired 
       pharmacist friend of mines been 
       sitting on these the last 15 
       years. 

                 JORDAN
       You fucking serious?!  


CLOSE ON -- a Lemmon 714 Quaalude; pure white, with 
trademark ridged edges.

                 JORDAN  
       The Lemmon 714 was the Holy Grail 
       of Quaaludes, outlawed since the 
       80s and three times as powerful 
       as anything available today.  For 
       a Quaalude addict, it was like 
       finding a 1952 Chateau Margaux.

CLOSE ON -- Donnie gauging Jordans excitement, waiting 
for the right moment to admit his fuck-up.

                 DONNIE
       Id been saving these for a 
       special occasion, like a birthday 
       or celebrating our money being out 
       of the country.  Instead I thought 
       Id better use em to help break 
       the news about Brad.  



INT. JORDANS ESTATE - MASTER BATHROOM - DAY         
(LATE SUMMER 95)



In his underwear, Jordan kneels over the toilet, sticking 
his fingers down his throat to make himself vomit.  

                 JORDAN 
       That night I cleared my schedule 
       and rid my body of anything that 
       could fuck with my high.  It was 
       celebration time.

He takes a box off the counter marked Active Enema.   
He squats and administers it...



INT. JORDANS ESTATE - BASEMENT - NIGHT (LATE SUMMER 95)



Massive, with a wet bar, media center and full gym.  
Giddy as kids on Christmas, Jordan and Donnie sit on the 
couch, the bottle of Lemmons before them. 

                 JORDAN
       Start with one, see how it goes?  

                 DONNIE
       My guy says ones all well need.  
       Salut. 

Excited, they each pop a lude, toast with hot sake...  

DISSOLVE TO:



INT. JORDANS ESTATE - BASEMENT - LATER (LATE SUMMER 95)



Bored, Jordan and Donnie sit on the couch watching 
Family Matters on TV.

                 JORDAN
       You feeling anything?

                 DONNIE

       Nope.  
           (glances at watch)
       Thirty five minutes.

                 JORDAN
       Maybe weve built up a tolerance  
       all these years?  

Donnie shrugs; they pop another, wash it down with sake.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. JORDANS ESTATE - BASEMENT - LATER (LATE SUMMER 95)


With Jordan running on the treadmill, Donnie pumps away 
on an exercise bike nearby.  Theyre both sweating.

                 DONNIE
       This is bullshit, man.  My fucking 
       metabolisms pumping and I dont 
       feel shit.

                 JORDAN
       Theyre old, maybe they lost their 
       potency.

Donnie leans over, picks up the bottle.  Reads the label.

                 DONNIE
       January 81.  Theyre fucking 
       duds.  

He shakes out more pills, two more apiece.  As they pop 
them, a very pregnant Naomi descends the stairs, now very 
pregnant. 

                 NAOMI
       What are you two retards doing?


                 JORDAN
       Nothing.  Working out. 

                 NAOMI
           (a look; then)
       Bo Dietls on the phone.

Naomi heads back upstairs.  Jordan picks up the phone.

                 JORDAN
       Bo, hey, whats up? 


INT. BO DIETLS CADILLAC - NIGHT (LATE SUMMER 95)



Bo Dietl talks on his cell phone. 

                 BO DIETL
       I need to talk to you, but not on 
       this phone.

INTERCUT JORDAN AND BO



                 JORDAN
       Why, whats--

                 BO DIETL
       Leave the house, call me back   
       from a pay phone, you hear me?



EXT. JORDANS ESTATE - NIGHT (LATE SUMMER 95)



Jordan pulls his Lamborghini out of the driveway. 

                 JORDAN 
       The Brookville Country Club was a 
       WASP stronghold, a straight shot 
       down the road from my house.



EXT. BROOKVILLE COUNTRY CLUB - NIGHT  (LATE SUMMER 95)



Jordan pulls up, exits the car in sweats, flip-flops and 
a T-shirt.  He hustles up a staircase into...



INT. BROOKVILLE COUNTRY CLUB - NIGHT  (LATE SUMMER 95)



Jordan stands at a pay phone, receiver to his ear.      
WE HEAR it ringing, then:

       

                 BO DIETL 
	Jordan?

                 JORDAN
       Yeah, Im at a pay phone.  Whats 
       going on?

INTERCUT:

INT. BO DIETLS CADILLAC - NIGHT (LATE SUMMER 95)


Bo talks on his cell. 

                 BO DIETL
       Your buddy Brads in jail.  

                 JORDAN
	Oh, Jesus Christ! What did he do? 

                 BO DIETL
	I dunno yet, they arrested him in 
	a shopping mall in Long Island 
       this morning, Im finding out.  
       But listen to me.  More important 
       than that.  The guy Denham I told 
       you about, the Fed?  Hes got your 
       phones tapped, Im pretty sure.  
	Home and office. 

	JORDAN
	Donnie, that piece of shit. Im 
	gonna kill him! That fat prick 
	mother fucker!

	BO DIETL
	But, listen to me. Do me a favor, 
	please do not talk on the phone.



                 JORDAN
       Fuck!

                 BO DIETL
       Did you try to bribe this fuckin 
       guy?

                 JORDAN
       What?  No!  I didnt try to bribe 
       anybody!

                 BO DIETL 
       Jordan?  I couldnt understand 
       you.  Say that again?

                 JORDAN
       I zay I zint ty zoo bibe azybuzzy!

                 BO DIETL
       Are you fucking high?

Jordan cant respond.  Phone still to his ear, his 
eyelids droop.  Drool spills from his slackened jaw.   

                 JORDAN 
       After fifteen years in storage, 
       the Lemmons had developed a 
       delayed fuse.  

JORDANS POV -- is hazy as he stares at his own 
reflection in the pay phone.  

                 JORDAN 
       It took 90 minutes for the little 
       fuckers to kick in, but once they 
       did -- pow!  I had skipped the 
       tingle phase and went straight to 
       the drool phase.

JORDANS POV -- the phone gets further and further away. 

                 JORDAN 
       Actually Id discovered a new 
       phase: the cerebral palsy phase.

BAMMM!!  Jordan hits the floor with a thud, crashed out 
on his back.  From the dangling phone, we hear:

                 BO DIETL 
           (over phone)
       Jordan! Jordan!  Do not get behind 
       the wheel!  Just tell me where 
       youre at, I'll send Rocco!

Jordan lolls his head toward the phone, tries to reach 
for it; he cant.  He lays there for a while, then:

                 JORDAN 
       Cmon, stand up!  

He rolls onto all fours, lifts a hand, topples over.  

                 JORDAN  
       Okay, walking is off the list of 
       options.  All right, what else is 
       there?    
           (a brainstorm)
       I can crawl, like Skylar!  

Slowly, Jordan begins crawling like an infant to the top 
of the staircase.   

EXT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT (LATE SUMMER 95)



The Lamborghini is parked at the bottom, twenty steps 
down.  He starts to crawl down the stairs, stops.  Tries 
again.  Cant figure out how to do it.  

                 JORDAN 
       Fuck!  The kid makes it look so 
       easy! 

An icy wind blows through his T-shirt.

                 JORDAN 
       Think, you motherfucker, think!
           (a few beats; then)
       Wait, Ive got it! 

Jordan slowly curls himself into a ball.  


                 JORDAN 
       I can roll!

Forcing himself over the edge, Jordan begins to descend 
the steps, one at a time.  Thump. Thump.  Then faster. 
Thump- Thump-Thump.  Faster still.  He loses control, 
takes all the steps at once.  Thump-Thump-Thump-Thump-
Thump-Thump.  He lands with a crash on the asphalt,  
drags himself up and into the Lamborghini.


INT. JORDANS LAMBORGHINI - NIGHT  (LATE SUMMER 95)



Ignition on, Jordan sits hunched over, chin resting on 
the steering wheel.  Just then, the car phone RINGS.  
With great effort, he pushes the speaker phone button:

                 JORDAN
       ...ello?
   
              NAOMI 
       Omigod!  Jordan, where are you?!

                 JORDAN
       Whazz a marra?
  
               NAOMI 
       Its Donnie, hes totally out of 
       control!  Hes on the other line 
       with some Swiss guy!

Jordans face reads horror.


                 JORDAN
       Whaa?!!  No!! 

                 NAOMI 
       I cant understand you!  Just get 
       home, hurry!

Naomi clicks off.  And as Jordan puts the car in gear... 

                 JORDAN 
       They say God protects drunks and 
       babies.  I was praying the same 
       held true for drug addicts.



EXT. HEGEMANS ROAD - NIGHT  (LATE SUMMER 95)



Peering over the wheel like an old lady, Jordan slowly 
maneuvers the Lamborghini down the dark road.

                 JORDAN 
       I was less than a mile from home 
       and drove slower than shit.     



EXT. JORDANS ESTATE - NIGHT  (LATE SUMMER 95)



Jordan pulls up in the Lamborghini, shuts the ignition.

                 JORDAN 
       Somehow I made it alive, not a 
       scratch on me or the car.  


INT. JORDANS ESTATE - FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT (LATE SUMMER 95)


CLOSE ON the TV, where a POPEYE cartoon is playing.   
PULL BACK to reveal Skylar watching.  As Jordan staggers 
in, Naomi approaches...

       Where Zonnie?!

                 JORDAN

                 NAOMI
       In the kitchen.


INT. JORDANS ESTATE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS



Phone to his ear and at least as stoned as Jordan, Donnie 
stands at the counter.

                 DONNIE

       --zee money, I wazza move izz to

INT. SAURELS BEDROOM - NIGHT                         
(LATE SUMMER 95)


Having been just woken up, Jean-Jacques Saurel sits up in 
bed, phone to his ear, a perplexed look on his face.  

                 SAUREL
       What language are you speaking, 
       Mr. Azoff?


INT. JORDANS ESTATE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS          
(LATE SUMMER 95)



With Naomi looking on, Jordan staggers toward Donnie  
like a drunk Frankenstein.  

                 JORDAN
       Ge ozza zone!  Ge ozza iz!!

                 DONNIE
       Waz?  Iz zoggin oo anzali!

                 JORDAN
       GE OZZA ZONE!!

With all the strength he can muster, Jordan RIPS the 
phone from the wall, throwing it skittering across the 
floor with a CLANG.   

                 NAOMI
       What the fuck are you doing?!

                 DONNIE
       Wazza fuh is wrong wizzz oooo?!!  
       I wuzz awwing to!!
           (Jordan grabs him)
       Wazza mazzer?!  Wazza yoo razy?!!

Skylar looks on from the next room, crying as Jordan 
tries to shake some sense into Donnie. Naomi crosses to 
Skylar and rushes her out of the room.


                 JORDAN
       Zee vone!!  He nah zuppose zoo 
       dalk on zee vone!!



                 DONNIE

                 DONNIE
	WUZZ?!

                 JORDAN
       WUZZ ZOD IN ZAW?!


                 DONNIE
       WUZZ?!

Fuck it.  Jordan releases Donnie. Donnie crawls into the  
dining room and starts shoving ham into his mouth in an 
effort to sober up.  Just then, we HEAR a horrible 
GAGGING sound.  Donnie holds his throat as he falls 
backward choking, taking out the entire glass kitchen 
table with a tremendous CRASH! Naomi rushes back in.



                 NAOMI
       Omigod, hes choking!  Jordan, do 
       something!!  

Just then, WE HEAR the triumphant Popeye FANFARE -- 
Jordan looks to the TV, where POPEYE pours a can of 
spinach down his gullet.  Instantly, his chest and arm 
muscles swell to five times their size. 

Jordan goes to get his coke.  He snarfs up two fat 
spoonfuls and -- like that -- his chest swells and he 
takes a deep breath and he dashes back to the rescue...

Jordan rushes back to Donnie, who is now blue.  

                 NAOMI 
       Hes not breathing!

Jordan places his fingers over Donnies artery.  Nothing.

       Save him! 

                 NAOMI 

Jordan kneels, starts furiously pumping Donnies chest, 
breathing air into his lungs in rhythmic bursts.

                 JORDAN 
       This stupid sonovabitch!  All 
       Donnie ever did was fuck me up and 
       now I had to save his life cause 
       I took a CPR class when the baby 
       was learning to swim.  Just for 
       the record, I want it noted: not 
       for a second did I even think 
       about letting him choke to death, 
       even though it wouldve saved me 
       an awful lot of headaches.

Donnie still isnt breathing.  Jordan flips him over, 
tries the Heimlich -- we hear a CRUNCH as he breaks 
Donnies ribs.  He flips him back over, but hes almost 
completely blue.

                 JORDAN
       He wont come back!  

                 NAOMI
       Dont let him die!  He has 
       children!

One last try.  Jordan takes a massive breath, blowing as 
hard as he can into Donnies lungs.  Donnies stomach 
distends like a balloon, then suddenly a chunk of ham 
projects from his mouth and into Jordans face.  Donnie 
coughs, vomiting.  And as he starts breathing again, 
Jordan exits and passes out on the living room couch.   


                 BROOKVILLE POLICE #1 
       Jordan Belfort? 

FADE TO BLACK.



INT. JORDANS ESTATE - FAMILY ROOM - DAY             
(LATE SUMMER 95)



Jordan opens his eyes.  Through his HAZY POV, we see 
Violet, the maid standing over him with two OLD 
BROOKVILLE POLICE OFFICERS as Naomi attends to Donnie in 
the background.


       

                 JORDAN
	Yes?

                 BROOKVILLE POLICE #1
       Sir, we need to ask you some 
       questions.

EXT. JORDANS ESTATE - NIGHT (LATE SUMMER 95) 

Jordan exits the house with the Police Officers.  The 
Lamborghini is TOTALLED, an absolute wreck.

                 JORDAN 
       Wow.  Maybe I hadnt made it home 
       okay.


EXT. HEGEMANS ROAD - NIGHT  (LATE SUMMER 95)



FLASHBACK.  Nodding out, Jordan drives the Lamborghini 
like a maniac, careening off parked cars and trees. 

                 JORDAN  
       It was an absolute miracle I 
       wasnt killed, and an even bigger 
       miracle I hadnt killed anyone.


INT. POLICE STATION - DAY (LATE SUMMER 95)



A MAN steps up to get his mug shot taken, but its Brad, 
not Jordan.  FLASH.  Turn to the side.  FLASH.

                 JORDAN 
       But they couldnt arrest me, the 
       cops had no proof Id been behind 
       the wheel.  Meanwhile, Brad did a 
       few months in jail for contempt 
       because he wouldnt rat Donnie 
       out.  They never found his gun, 
       though, so they finally had to let 
       him go.  


EXT. HORSE FARM - LONG ISLAND - DAY (OCT 95)

Jordan watches an INSTRUCTOR lead Skylar on a pony.  
Nearby Naomi holds newborn PARKER.  Manny Riskin and Max 
stand beside Jordan.

                 MANNY RISKIN
       Youre a lucky guy, Jordan. 
       Legally Ive never seen anyone 
       slip a noose the way you do.  
       Christ, youre lucky to be alive 
       much less not in jail.

                 JORDAN
       I dont believe in luck.

                 MANNY RISKIN
       Thats what all lucky people say.
       Its time, Jordan.  Let me make a 
       deal with SEC.  Before your luck 
       runs out.

Skylar waves from the pony and Jordan waves back.

                 JORDAN
       What kind of terms?

                 MANNY RISKIN
       You plead guilty to a handful of 
       securities violations -- stock 
       manipulation, high pressure sales 
       tactics, ticky-tack shit like 
       that.  You pay a few million 
       dollars in fines and in exchange 
       the SEC fucks off for all time.

                 JORDAN
       And Stratton?  What happens there?                           

                 MANNY RISKIN
       Youd have to walk away.  Let 
       Donnie take over.
           (that one hurts)
       Now the FBIs a different animal.  
       They can still pursue you for 
       criminal wrongdoing.  But with you 
       on the sidelines, my guess is your 
       best friend Agent Denhamll be 
       left standing around with his dick 
       in his hand.

Jordan digests that.

                 MAX
       You beat them, Jordan.  You won.   
       Sail into the sunset with your 
       wife and kids while you can.  

                 MANNY RISKIN
       God knows youll never have to 
       work again. 


As Jordan looks at his picture-perfect family, WE HEAR 
THE ROAR OF A CROWD...  

INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - BULLPEN - DAY           
(SPRING 96)

The troops ROAR as Jordan takes center stage.


                 JORDAN
       Im sure many of you have been 
       hearing rumors lately, about me, 
       about the future of this firm, and 
       thats what Id like to talk to 
       you about today.    
           (a few beats, then)
       Five years ago when I started 
       Stratton with Donnie Azoff, I knew 
       the day would eventually come when  
       Id be moving on.  Its truly with 
       a heavy heart that I tell you that 
       day is here.

The place erupts in a chorus of No!, Dont go!, etc. Jordan raises his hand for quiet.

                 JORDAN 
       Thank you for that and for your 
       years of incredible loyalty and 
       admiration.  
   
                 JORDAN 
       The point is though, that under 
       Donnies leadership, along with 
       Robbie Feinberg and Nicky Koskoff 
       moving into key management 
       positions, this place is gonna be 
       better than ever!  

A smattering of applause.  Jordan notices a few Brokers 
gravely shaking their heads.

                 JORDAN 
       And the fact that I'm gone wont 
       stop me from giving Donnie advice, 
       not that he needs any--

                 DONNIE
           (jumping in)
       Why would anyone in their right 
       mind not follow JB's advice?

Donnie looks petrified; hes used to being an offensive 
tackle, not the quarterback.

                 JORDAN
       Before I go, theres something I 
       want to remind you all, and thats 
       this -- Stratton Oakmont is bigger 
       than any one person, even me.  
       Especially me.  You guys are 
       Stratton, each and every one of 
       you, and that is why its sure to 
       remain the best brokerage firm in 
       the fucking world!

Thunderous applause spreads through the boardroom, all 
300 Brokers on their feet.  WE PUSH IN on Jordan.   

                 JORDAN 
       See, the very idea of Stratton is 
       that when you come here and step 
       into this bullpen for the first 
       time, you start your life anew. 
       You have a place here and no one 
       can take that away from you!  
       Stratton Oakmont is America!  Give 
       me your tired and poor!  The very 
       moment you walk through that door 
       and pledge your loyalty to this 
       firm, you become part of a family, 
       you become a Strattonite!  It 
       doesnt matter who you are, it 
       doesnt matter where youre from!  
       Whether your family came over on 
       the Mayflower or on a fucking 
       inner tube from Haiti!  


                                     
More applause.  Jordan scans the young faces -- they 
worship him.  In the crowd he finds KIMMIE BELZER, 30s. 

                 JORDAN 
       Everybody here knows Kimmie 
       Belzer, right?

Hoots and hollers...  He raises his hand for quiet.

                 JORDAN 
       In case any of you weren't aware 
       of it, Kimmie was one of 
       Stratton's first brokers, one of 
       the original twenty.  Now when 
       most of you met Kimmie, you met 
       her the way she is today -- a 
       beautiful woman who drives a brand 
       new Mercedes, a woman who lives in 
       the finest condo complex on Long 
       Island.  A woman who wears $3000 
       Armani suits, who spends her 
       winters in the Bahamas and her 
       summers in the Hamptons!  

Wild applause.

                 JORDAN 
       But thats not the Kimmie I met.  
       The Kimmie I met was broke, a 
       single mom on the balls of her 
       ass.  Three months behind on her 
       rent with an eight year old son!  
       She came to me for a job and when 
       I hired her she asked for a $5000 
       dollar advance so she could pay 
       his tuition.  And what did I do, 
       Kimmie?

                 KIMMIE
       You wrote me a check for $25,000!

                 JORDAN
       Because I believed in you, like   
       I believe in each and every one  
       of you!  

                 KIMMIE
       I love you, Jordan!  

As the Brokers go berserk, Jordan stands basking in the 
adoration.  He looks at Donnie, turns back to the Crowd, 
looks out at the faces.  A change has come over him.    
He stands there, thinking.  An eternity, then:


                                                      JORDAN
       You know for years Ive been 
       telling you guys not to take no 
       for an answer, to keep pushing,  
       to not hang up the phone till you 
       get what you want.  This deal Im 
       about to sign, barring me from the 
       securities industry, barring me 
       from Stratton, my home... What the 
       fuck is that?  Ill tell you what 
       it is, its me being a hypocrite.  
       Its me taking no for an answer, 
       its them selling me, not the 
       other way around!  Fuck it, Im 
       not leaving!   

Jordan smiles, thrusts his hands in the air -- 

                 JORDAN 
       THE SHOW GOES ON!!

The place goes absolutely INSANE.  And as Donnie and Max 
trade looks, TECHNO MUSIC BLASTS taking us to...



EXT. YACHT NAOMI - AFT DECK - DAY (SPRING 96)



Its celebration time.  DOZENS of Strattonites party, 
drinking/dancing/snorting, Jordan at the center of it.

                 JORDAN  
       Of course, the troops werent the 
       only ones who were thrilled.



INT. DENHAMS OFFICE - DAY (SPRING 96)

Agent Denham hears the news over the phone. A smile 
touches his lips: his case goes on... 



EXT. YACHT NAOMI - AFT DECK (SPRING 96)



The party continues as Brad comes aboard.  Hes welcomed 
and showered with lapdancers.

                 JORDAN 
       I apologized to Brad and promised 
       him hed never have to deal with 
       Donnie again.  Even offered to pay 
       him for his time in the can.  But 
       he said no, he was out.  Sad thing 
       was, he was dead two years later.  
       Massive heart attack while sitting 
       on the john.


INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - JORDANS OFFICE - DAY  
(SPRING 96)   



Janet enters Jordans office, leaves a stack of legal 
papers on his desk.

                 JORDAN  
       Within days, subpoenas started 
       flying.  They were burying me in 
       paper -- 



INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - BULLPEN - DAY (SPRING 96)



Donnie pisses on a subpoena, to applause.

                 JORDAN 
       -- notices to produce documents, 
       depositions.  Donnie couldnt 
       drink water fast enough.

INT. S.E.C. - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY (SPRING 96)



As Manny Riskin looks on, Jordan sits across from the 
three SEC Attorneys and a COURT REPORTER. 

                 JORDAN 
       They interrogated everybody, it 
       went on for months.  It was total 
       fucking harassment...  



A SERIES OF CUTS -- (SPRING 96) 



Various Stratton Brokers are deposed: Robbie; Rugrat, 
Peter DeBlasio, Sea Otter; Chester Ming.


                 JORDAN 
       ... but not a single Strattonite  
       cracked.  Donnie and I were given 
       strict instructions not to leave 
       the country...



EXT. YACHT NAOMI - AFT DECK - DAY (SUMMER 96)

                 JORDAN 
       ...so we took our wives to Italy. 
       Each of us had a couple of million 
       we needed to deposit anyway --

ON A DUFFEL BAG FULL OF MONEY just resting on deck.



                 JORDAN 
       -- this seemed the most civilized 
       way to transport it overseas.

ON ANOTHER BAG, this one brimming with bottles of pills, 
bags of pot, vials of coke.  Jordan and Donnie cut up 
lines as a HOSTESS serves Bloody Marys.

                 HOSTESS
       Can I get you anything else, 
       gentlemen?

                 JORDAN
       I have a rare condition that 
       requires me to drink one of these 
       every fifteen minutes.  If you 
       could set your egg timer, Id 
       appreciate it.

She goes.  The blow is ready for inhaling.  Jordan and 
Donnie are doing a you first, no, you first routine 
with a rolled up $100 when a CELL rings.  Donnie grabs 
it.

                 DONNIE
       Rugrat! Bongiorno, my bald eagle!



INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - OFFICE - DAY (SUMMER 96)

                 RUGRAT
       We may have a problem. Your 
       friend, Steve Madden, hes 
       unloading shares.


EXT. YACHT NAOMI - DAY (SUMMER 96)

Donnie reacts as Rugrat expounds.

                 DONNIE
       What?!  Youre fucking kidding?!

                 RUGRAT
       No. I wish I was. 

                 DONNIE
           (to Jordan)
       Rugrat says Steve Maddens 
       unloading shares.

                 JORDAN
       What?! (Grabs Donnies phone) 
       Rugrat, what the fuck? 

                 JORDAN 
       (Hands Donnie his phone) Call the 
       sonovabitch! Hold on a second. 

BACK AT STRATTON...

                 RUGRAT
       Im looking at the screen and huge 
       chunks of Steve Madden are being 
       sold. Were not doing it so its 
       gotta be Steve. Hes the only 
       person who owns that many shares.

ON THE BOAT...

Jordan cups the phone, looks to Donnie who shrugs.

                 DONNIE
       Hes not picking up.

                 JORDAN
       Your fucking friend is trying to 
       fuck me.  And you know where hes 
       trying to fuck me?  Up the ass.
           (back to Rugrat)
       I need some time to think.

Jordan thinks, snorts a line to think better.

                 JORDAN 
       Even though I owned 85% of Steve-
       Cocksucker-Madden-fucking-Shoes, 
       the shares were in his fucking 
       name.  Motherfucker knew I was in 
       trouble with the Feds and was 
       trying to take advantage.

He gets back on the phone with Rugrat.

                 JORDAN
       Tell all the brokers to sell.  
       Drive the price down. Steve will 
       go cockless when he watches me 
       turn his company into a penny 
       stock.
           (he hangs up)
       Sonovacunt!
           (yelling below deck)
       Captain Ted!!  Start er up, we 
       gotta go home!  

The sight of Naomi and Hildy returning from their trip 
ashore stops him.  Because Naomis weeping, Hildy 
consoling her.

                 JORDAN 
       What the fuck?!  What happened?


                 NAOMI
       I got a call from cousin Betty.  
       Aunt Emmas dead.

Off Jordans reaction as Naomi weeps and laments the 
dearly departed: she was so young, so healthy etc. --

                 JORDAN 
       Fucking heart attack.  Boom-snap, 
       she was gone.  Shuffled off her 
       mortal coil and twenty million 
       dollars in a Swiss bank account.



INT. BANQUE REAL DE GENEVE - SAURELS OFFICE - DAY     
(SUMMER 96)



Jean-Jacques Saurel sits at his desk, calmly smoking as 
he talks on the phone.

                 SAUREL
       It is terrible.  Your aunt was 
       such an elegant, attractive woman.

INTERCUT JORDAN ON THE BOAT AND SAUREL IN GENEVA


                 JORDAN
           (no time for it)
       Thanks but where does this leave 
       us in regard to her account?  It 
       goes into probate or what?

                 SAUREL
       Not to worry, Jordan.  Your aunt, 
       before she died, signed a document 
       naming you as her successor. 

       

                 JORDAN
		She did?!

                 SAUREL
           (a sly grin)
       Well.  Not as of yet.

And as they continue talking, Jordan pulls out a nautical 
map of the Italian coastline:

                 JORDAN 
       I gotta say, these Swiss were 
       sneaky motherfuckers.  Within 
       minutes he made arrangements to 
       set me up with a forger, the best 
       document specialist in Geneva.  


                                                      JORDAN  
       Thing was: I had to get there in 
       three business days to co-sign on 
       the account.  

Jordan goes rapid-fire.  He yells:

                 JORDAN
       Captain Ted!  Change of plan! 
       Were going to Monaco. 

 

                 NAOMI
      Monaco, now?

                 JORDAN
       Yes, babe. Were going to Monaco 
       so then we can go to Switzerland. 

                 HILDY
       But her aunt just died, we cant 
       go to --

                 JORDAN
       I realize that but we have to go 
       to Switzerland. 

       

                 DONNIE
	What about --

                 JORDAN
           (way ahead of him)
       -- keep calling, when the fuck 
       picks up, set a meet with him in 
       three business days.

                 NAOMI
       We gotta go to London.

                 JORDAN
		Why?!

                 NAOMI
		The funeral.

                 JORDAN
       Honey, I loved your Aunt Emma more 
       than anyone in the world, but 
       shes still gonna be dead in two 
       days. Shes not going anywhere. 

Captain Ted Beecham emerges from below.

                 JORDAN 
       Captain Ted, weve gotta get to 
       Monaco.

       

                 CAPTAIN TED
		Monaco?

                 JORDAN
       Then we drive to Switzerland so 
       they dont stamp our passports. 
       Take care of business. Drive back 
       to Monaco, fly to London for the 
       funeral, fly back to New York to 
       be there in three business days - 
       Thats the fuckin plan.

                 CAPTAIN TED
       Im getting reports of some 
       weather out there.  Might run into 
       some chop.

                 JORDAN
       The boats 170 feet long.  She can 
       handle a little chop.  

                 HILDY
       Were not going anywhere until he 
       says its safe. 

       



                 DONNIE
	Chop is fine. 
  
                 JORDAN
       Is it safe? 

                 CAPTAIN TED
       If we take it slow...
       

                 JORDAN
	We can do it? 

                 CAPTAIN TED
       Chop is chop. Some chop - it can 
       be uncomfortable. 

                 JORDAN
       Well, thats fine. 

                 CAPTAIN TED
       Anything is possible. I mean well 
       have to batten down the hatches 
       just to be safe. Could be a few 
       broken dishes. 

                 JORDAN
       A few broken dishes. Isnt that 
       great? Lets go to Monaco - 

Jordan, Captain Ted and Donnie rush down stairs. As the 
ENGINE starts...


EXT. MEDITERRANEAN SEA - NIGHT  (SUMMER 96)



The perfect storm.  As the Naomi tips at a 45-degree 
angle, a thick wall of gray water comes rising over her 
side, slamming onto the bridge with a thunderous CRASH.

                 JORDAN 
       Well talk about your shitty 
       vacations...  

Six Jet Skis plummet off the deck into the raging sea.



INT. YACHT NAOMI - BRIDGE - NIGHT (SUMMER 96) 



Donnie and Naomi stand on the bridge where Captain Ted 
Beecham holds the ship's wheel with both hands, the radio 
blaring in the background. Jordan enters.

                 JORDAN
       What the fuck is going on? 

                 CAPTAIN TED
       Jet skis just went overboard.

                 RADIO VOICE
       Gale warning!  Gale warning!

                 CAPTAIN TED 
       The waves are twenty feet and 
       building! 

                 JORDAN
       Cant you turn us around?!

                 CAPTAIN TED
       Well get broad-sided and tip 
       over!

                 RADIO VOICE 
       Gale warning!  Gale warning!

Naomi turns to Jordan, furious with him.

                 NAOMI
       You happy now, you piece of shit? 
       Were gonna drown.

                 JORDAN
       Im a master diver. We will not 
       drown, I promise you. I got you, 
       baby.

(realizing shes probably right; to Donnie)
			
			JORDAN       
		The ludes!



       

                 DONNIE 
	What?
                
			 JORDAN
       Get the fucking ludes!

                 DONNIE 
       Theyre below deck! Theres like 
       three feet of water down there!

                 JORDAN
       I cant die fucking sober!

As Donnie heads off --  

                 NAOMI
       What is he crazy? Wheres he 
       going? Donnie!



INT. BELOW DECKS - CONTINUOUS

Donnie retrieves the ludes.



INT. YACHT NAOMI - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

Captain Ted stares through his binoculars.  

                 CAPTAIN TED
       Jesus Christ!  

TIME CUT TO: Donnie returns with ludes - feeds to Jordan and then himself.

                 JORDAN
       Whats happening?!

       Rogue wave! 

                 CAPTAIN TED

Jordan grabs Naomi.  All at once the boat dips down at an 
impossibly steep angle, until its pointing almost 
straight down.  Captain Ted jams the throttle and the 
boat jerks forward, rising up the face of a giant rogue 
wave, which curls over the top of the bridge and...

KABOOM! -- Blackness.  Slowly, painfully, the boat pops 
up from beneath the water, its helicopter RIPPING from 
the deck and crashing into the sea.  

                 CAPTAIN TED 
           (into radio)
       Mayday!  This is Captain Ted 
       Beecham aboard the Yacht Naomi! 
       This is a Mayday!  

                 CAPTAIN TED 
       We are going down at the head 
       fifty miles off the coast of Rome 
       and we require immediate 
       assistance!



INT. ITALIAN NAVAL DESTROYER - BELOW DECK - NIGHT   
(SUMMER 96)



Off to the side, Jordan watches as Naomi, their Friends, 
and the yachts Crew Members dance to blaring techno 
music.  A small group of Italian SAILORS cheer them on.  

                 JORDAN 
       The nice thing about getting 
       rescued by Italians is that the 
       first thing they do is feed you 
       and make you drink red wine.   
       Then they make you dance.

Jordan watches as the dancing continues, then casually 
glances out a porthole, where WE SEE the distant lights 
of a PLANE making its way across the night sky.  After a 
few beats, the plane EXPLODES, a tiny flash of light.  

                 JORDAN 
       Did you see that?  That was the 
       plane I sent for to come get us.  
       I shit you not, it exploded when  
       a seagull flew into the engine, 
       three people killed.  You want a 
       sign from God, well after all this 
       I finally got the message.  I had 
       to make some fucking changes. 

FADE OUT.



24 MONTHS LATER



INT. JORDANS ESTATE - LIVING ROOM - DAY (SUMMER 98)



Jordan, looking healthier than weve seen him thus far, 
sits on the couch; stacks of paperwork on the coffee 
table. After a few beats, Naomi enters from the kitchen. 

                 NAOMI
       Dinners ready.

                 JORDAN
       I gotta finish these balance 
       sheets, babe. 


                 NAOMI
       Well, its there. So the kids are 
       gonna start. 

Naomi exits. Jordan goes back to work. Looks up at TV. 
Watches for a bit. 

                 JORDAN 
       Whats the single most important 
       skill in life you can ever master?

CUT TO:



Shot on 90s-era video, an ad intended for late-night 
local tv.  The defining idea here is that while the 
commercial may be amateurish, Jordan isnt; hes an 
excellent salesman even if the ad is cut-rate.

WE START WITH FLASHES OF THE SEMINAR: Jordan in front of 
a dry erase board, lecturing a small audience.

                 JORDAN
       At the essence of every personal 
       interaction, of every business 
       transaction, of every effective 
       human communication is 
       PERSUASION... once you learn to 
       control the linguistic encounter, 
       you will be SHOCKED at what will 
       happen... you are a person worth 
       listening to, and taking it one 
       step higher than that, you are 
       someone who can help them achieve 
       their goals...



JORDAN ON THE GROUNDS OF HIS ESTATE, addressing us.  



                 JORDAN 
       Do you dream of being financially 
       independent but struggle every 
       month just to pay your bills?  
       Would you like to own a home like 
       this one someday but can barely 
       afford to pay your rent?
           (ZOOM IN ON HIM)
       My name is Jordan Belfort and 
       theres no secret to wealth 
       creation.  No matter who you are, 
       where you came from, you too can 
       become financially independent in 
       just a matter of months.  All you 
       need is a strategy.
           (NEW ANGLE; he enters 
            from same side as 
            previous shot)

                 JORDAN 
       The first action you have to take 
       is to DECIDE to be wealthy.  When 
       I was 24 years old, I made a 
       DECISION not to just survive but 
       to THRIVE.  I started my own stock 
       brokerage firm, developing a 
       SYSTEM OF SELLING that within a 
       year made me a multi-millionaire. 



A SNAPSHOT OF JORDANS CHILDHOOD HOME, then OF HIS 
CURRENT ESTATE, FOLLOWED BY EXAMPLES OF WEALTH: his 
sportscars, Naomi in a bikini, stock footage of a jet... 


                 JORDAN 
       From these humble middle-class 
       beginnings, I now live here...with 
       my beautiful wife and 
       kids...living the lifestyle of our 
       dreams...



THE SEMINAR.  Jordan high-fives attendees.



                 JORDAN 
       Now Im passing along the secrets 
       to my success in my 90-minute free 
       seminar, Jordan Belforts 
       Straight Line Persuasion.



FIRST TESTIMONIAL.  A MAN holds a framed check.



                 MAN
       I have here in my hand, framed, is 
       a check for twenty-seven thousand 
       four hundred and thirty-seven 
       dollars and sixty-three cents that 
       I netted from one deal after 
       attending Jordan Belforts, um, 
       Straight Line Persuasion seminar.



JORDAN, on a yacht with NAOMI and some MODELS.



                 JORDAN
       Theres nobody stopping you from 
       making millions.  There is nobody 
       holding you back from financial 
       freedom.
           (to Naomi)
       Thank You Sweet Heart.
           (back to camera)
       Dont just sit at home or the life 
       of your dreams will sail right 
       past you.



TESTIMONIAL #2.  A COUPLE in a kitschy living room.



                 HUSBAND
       Thanks to the Straight Line 
       System, we could afford this home 
       and now were living the lives of 
       our dreams.


A HELICOPTER descends to a helipad.



                 JORDAN 
       Ive changed all these peoples 
       lives and I can change yours, too!

It touches down and Jordan jumps out to address us --

                 JORDAN
       So come to my seminar!!  The life 
       of your dreams is only a decision 
       away --

and BAM! gets clothes-lined by Agent Denham.


INT. CENTRAL BOOKING - QUEENS - NIGHT  (SEP 98)

CLOSE ON JORDANS HANDS, at last in cuffs.  PAN UP TO 
HIM, looking none-too-pleased.

                 JORDAN 
       This one takes the cake.  It was 
       Rugrat, hed been busted down in 
       Miami, and guess who the fuck 
       with? 



EXT. MIAMI RESTAURANT - NIGHT (SEP 98)



Jean-Jacques Saurel is handcuffed by Feds as Rugrat looks 
on crying, handcuffed nearby. 

                 JORDAN 
       What were the odds?  There had to 
       be ten thousand Swiss bankers in 
       Geneva and I choose the one dumb 
       enough to get himself arrested on 
       U.S. soil.  


INT. MIAMI FBI OFFICE - NIGHT (SEP 98)


CLICK!  Saurel gets his mug shot taken.


                                     
                 JORDAN 
       Even more ironic was he'd gotten 
       himself indicted on charges that 
       had nothing to fucking do with me. 



EXT. MIAMI MANSION - NIGHT  (SEP 98) 



ROCKY AOKI, Japanese, 50s, is led out in handcuffs by a 
MAN in an FBI windbreaker. 

                 JORDAN 
       Something about laundering drug 
       money through offshore boat racing 
       and a guy named Rocky Aoki, the 
       founder of Benihana.



INSERT BENI HANA COMMERCIAL -- 



A smiling Rocky Aoki looks on as a HIBACHI CHEF expertly 
dices shrimp on a sizzling grill. 

                 JORDAN 
       Beni-fucking-hana!  Why would God 
       be so cruel as to choose a chain 
       of fucking Hibachi Restaurants to 
       bring me down?



INT. SAURELS BEDROOM - DAY (OCT 95)



Saurel lays on the bed, smoking.

                 JORDAN  
       Long story short was Saurel ratted 
       me out, but not before he ratted 
       out Chantalle, who it turns out 
       hed been fucking every time she 
       went to Switzerland!

Chantalle emerges from the bathroom naked.  Laughing, she 
runs and jumps in bed with Saurel.



INT. FEDERAL COURT - QUEENS - DAY  (SEP 98)



With his criminal attorney NOLAN DRAGER, 40s, next to 
him, Jordan stands before a JUDGE, being arraigned.

                 JORDAN 
       I was indicted for money 
       laundering, securities fraud and  
       an endless list of other shit.


                 HON. SAMANTHA STOGEL
           (leafing through a 
            subpoena)
       One count engaging in conspiracy 
       to commit securities fraud.  Two 
       counts securities fraud.  One 
       count engaging in conspiracy to 
       commit money laundering.  Twenty-
       one counts money laundering.  One 
       count obstruction of justice.
           (gives Jordan a 
            withering glare)
       Bail is set at ten million 
       dollars.


The Judge bangs the gavel.


INT. FEDERAL COURT LOBBY - DAY

Jordan walks with Nolan Drager, who flips through the 
subpoena.

                 NOLAN DRAGER
       This is...well, its not good.  
       Its pretty bad actually.  How 
       much money do you have, Jordan?

                 JORDAN
       I can make bail.

                 NOLAN DRAGER
       I dont mean the ten million, I 
       mean for legal fees.  Cuz if you 
       want to fight this thing, its 
       gonna be expensive.  Like, sell-
       everything-you-own-expensive.



EXT. U.S. ATTORNEYS OFFICE - DAY  (SEP 98) 



Jordan exits the building.  Hes fucked and he knows it.  
He sees beautiful Naomi waiting for him beside a 
limosine; life isnt totally hopeless.  He approaches.

                 JORDAN
       Nay, thank God.  Im so glad 
       youre here.

They embrace.  He cant see her expression: shed rather 
be anywhere else.


SCENE 225 OMITTED



EXT. JORDANS ESTATE - POOL AREA - DAY  (SEP 98)



ON SKYLAR AND PARKER, playing with a NANNY and Rocky the 
dog.  Jordan watches them, sitting by his pool, drinking 
an ODouls, weighing his options.  

Donnie pops into the yard, in Uncle Donnie mode.

                 DONNIE
       Hey, everybody!  Howre the 
       happiest people in Long Island?  
       Hi, Rocky!!
           (joining Jordan)
       Hate that fucking dog.

                 JORDAN
       Tell me about it.  Its getting 
       old, starting to shit inside the 
       house again.

Jordan offers Donnie an ODouls; Donnie declines.

                 DONNIE
       How you doing, brother?  How was 
       the food in jail?

                 JORDAN
       Lobster Newburg sucked.  They gave 
       me some jewelry though.

He shows off the electronic bracelet around his ankle. 

                 DONNIE
       Wonder if they got one in my size.  
       Fuckin Rugrat, that wig-wearin 
       hump.  Tell you one thing: Im 
       never eating at Benihanas again.  
       Wheres Naomi?

                 JORDAN
       Inside.  Pissed.

Donnie sees Naomi in a window.  He waves but she barely 
registers him.

                 DONNIE
       Whats up her ass?

                 JORDAN
       Had to mortgage the home to make 
       bail.  Probably gonna hafta sell 
       it to pay my lawyers.  If we fight 
       this thing.

Donnie weighs that.


                                                     DONNIE
       The Feds say anything about coming 
       after the rest of us?

Jordan thinks, then shakes his head no.  

                 DONNIE 
       You know, were all behind you.  
       Everyone at the office.  
           (he removes an 
            envelope, hands it 
            to Jordan)
       We bought back your mortgage.  All 
       the founding partners threw in a 
       million apiece.  Figured none of 
       us would have it if it werent for 
       you.

Jordans profoundly touched.  Donnie squeezes his 
shoulder.  A real moment of friendship.

                 DONNIE 
       You gotta fight this thing, baby.

Jordan nods.

                 JORDAN 
       Like I said, loyalty meant a lot 
       to me.  Without your friends and 
       family standing behind you, youre 
       fucked.


INT. U.S. ATTORNEYS OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY           
(SEP 98)


Jordan sits with Nolan Drager across from FBI Agent 
Denham, U.S. Attorney LUCAS SOLOMON, 50s, and Assistant 
U.S. Attorney ROCHELLE APPLEBAUM, 30s, humorless.   

                 LUCAS SOLOMON
       Theres a term we have around 
       here, we dont like to use it 
       often, only when circumstances 
       dictate.  Its called a Grenada.  
       Inspired by our governments 
       invasion in 1983 of the island 
       nation of only 90,000 people, 
       basically it stands for any case 
       we get which is pretty much unlose-
       able.  We could show up late and 
       drunk to court, fuck up left-right-
       and-center and still wed win.  
       Mr. Belfort, you, sir, are a

       Youre looking at real prison 
       time.  Money laundering gets you 
       as much as 20 years.  Case 
       couldnt be stronger if wed have 
       caught you with your cash in your 
       mattress.

Solomon pushes a box full of evidence across the table.  
Jordan eyeballs Denham.

                 LUCAS SOLOMON
       Read the discovery.

                 JORDAN
       That your lifes work in the box?

                 AGENT DENHAM
       Jordan, you rotting in jail til 
       your kidsre outta college isnt 
       our ambition here.  You werent 
       the only one involved in all this.  
       We think those folks deserve their 
       day in court too.

                 NOLAN DRAGER 
       Why do I get the sense theres an 
       offer in the air?  If so, lets 
       put it on the table. 

                 LUCAS SOLOMON
       Full cooperation.  A comprehensive 
       list of all coconspirators 
       spanning the last seven years and 
       he agrees to wear a wire. 

                 JORDAN
       You want me to rat?

                 LUCAS SOLOMON
       We want your cooperation in --

                 AGENT DENHAM 
       Yes.  We want you to rat.


INT. JORDANS ESTATE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT (SEP 98)   



                 JORDAN
       How was Christys party?

                 NAOMI
		It was fine. 


                 JORDAN
       Baby, I talked to the lawyers 
       again today. I have some really 
       great news. As it turns out youre 
       totally off the hook. 

                 NAOMI
       I know that already.

                 JORDAN
       You never did anything wrong 
       anyway, right? At the end of the 
       day all they really want is for me 
       to cooperate - thats it. 
       See, apparently, I know so much 
       about whats going on in the stock 
       market that I could save the 
       government years of heartache. But 
       it gets even better... You see, 
       if I cooperate Ill only have to 
       serve four short years and any 
       fine Id have to pay wouldnt be 
       due til after I serve my sentence. 
       Well still have plenty of money 
       left over. The only thing that I 
       was kind of upset about was the 
       fact that I might have to give 
       them information about my friends.

                 NAOMI
       Like you said, Theres no friends 
       on Wall Street.

                 JORDAN
       But theres a silver lining to 
       that too... It turns out that all 
       of em are probably gonna 
       cooperate too. So in the end, that 
       wont really be a factor.

                 NAOMI
       Well, thats really good news, 
       honey. Im really happy for you. 

                 JORDAN
       No, its good for both of us, Nay. 

       Yeah, yeah.

                 NAOMI

                 JORDAN
       Make love to me baby. Make love to 
       me nice and slow.

                 NAOMI
       No Jordan. Stop!


INT. JORDANS ESTATE - MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS



TIME CUT: Jordan is fucking Naomi. Its the best hes 
felt in days. While hes lost in it, shes lost interest, 
going through the motions perfunctorily. 

                 JORDAN
       I love you, Nay. I love you so 
       much. Ive loved you from the 
       first time I saw you. 


                 NAOMI
	Fuck you. 

That stops him.
                
			 JORDAN
	What? 
                 NAOMI
       I fucking hate you.

                 JORDAN
       What are you talking about?

                 NAOMI
       You dont give a shit about how I 
       feel. All you care about is 
       yourself. 

                 JORDAN
       Thats not true. What do you mean?

                 NAOMI
       You wanna fuck me? Fine. Fuck me 
       hard like its the last time.

                 JORDAN
       Hold still. Why are you moving 
       like that? 

                 NAOMI
       Go ahead, fuck me! 

                 JORDAN
       What are you doing baby? 

                 NAOMI
       Cum for me. Cum for me, baby. Like 
       its the last time.

                 JORDAN
       You want me to cum, baby?

                 NAOMI
       Yeah, cum for me baby, cum! 


After a beat... He cums. Jordan rolls off Naomi. They lie 
in uncomfortable silence.

                 NAOMI 
       Jordan, that was the last time. I 
       want a divorce. 

                 JORDAN
       What are you talking about?

                 NAOMI
       I want a divorce. 

                 JORDAN
       What? What are you talking about? 
       Now? After we just made love? 

                 NAOMI
       And I wanted to puke. 

Naomi gets up. 

                 NAOMI 
       I dont love you anymore Jordan. I 
       havent for a long time. 

                 JORDAN
       You dont love me? Isnt that 
       convenient. Now, you dont love 
       me? Now while Im under federal 
       indictment with a fucking bracelet 
       around my ankle? Now, all of a 
       sudden, you decide you dont love 
       me?

                 NAOMI
       Yes, thats right. 

                 JORDAN
       What kind of a person are you?

                 NAOMI
       You married me. This is how its 
       gonna be. Listen Jordan. Im 
       taking custody of the kids. If you 
       agree to the divorce right now, I 
       will allow you visitation. Dont 
       try to fight it. It will save us 
       both a lot of money and I have a 
       feeling youre gonna need it. 

Naomi exits to the dressing room. Jordan gets up, follows 
after her. 

                 JORDAN
       Ive got news for you. Youre not 
       taking my kids. 


                 NAOMI
       I already spoke to my lawyer. He 
       said even if you dont get 
       convicted I can still get custody. 

                 JORDAN
       My lawyers are more powerful than 
       yours. Youre not taking my kids! 
       You vicious cunt!

Naomi slaps Jordan. Jordan hits her back and exits. 

                 JORDAN 
       Fuck you! Youre not taking my 
       kids. You fucking bitch!

CUT TO:


INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS



Jordan grabs a pair of scissors and starts slashing the 
couch. He retrieves a stash of coke from the couch 
lining. Naomi enters the hallway as Jordan snorts coke.

                 NAOMI
       Look at yourself Jordan. Youre 
       sick, youre a sick man. 

                 JORDAN
       Youre not taking my kids.

                 NAOMI
       You think Id let my kids near 
       you? Look at you. You know what my 
       lawyers said? Youre going to jail 
       for twenty years. Twenty fucking 
       years, Jordan. Youll be lucky if 
       you ever see them again.

                 JORDAN
       Oh yeah? You dont think Im gonna 
       see my kids again? Oh yeah?

Jordan heads towards Skylars room. She tries to stop 
Jordan. He knocks her to the ground. 

Jordan charges towards Skylars room.

Jordan exiting Skylars room with Skylar crying in his 
arms. Naomi starts to pull herself up from off the floor 
as Jordan races toward the stairs.

                 NAOMI
       Put her down Jordan! Put her down!




Jordan and Skylar descend the stairs. Naomi pulls herself 
together and follows.


INT. / EXT. GARAGE - NIGHT

Jordan races through the garage door, slamming and 
locking it behind him. 

                 NAOMI 
       Violet, Violet! Help me! Hes got 
       Skylar! Get the key! 

Jordan putting Skylar in the car. 




Naomi and Violet desperately try to open the garage door.   *

Naomi races into the garage. Jordan gets in the drivers 
seat, locks the doors and starts the engine. 

Naomi begs him to stop. Violet presses the garage door 
button. Naomi grabs a tool and smashes the driver side 
window.

Jordan sees the door closing - he thinks fuck it - 
slams into reverse, crashing through the garage door. Car 
continues in reverse, crashing into a concrete pillar. 

Naomi and Violet rush to the car, pull Skylar out and 
bring her inside the house. Jordan sits as blood rushes 
down his face. 

                 LUCAS SOLOMAN 
       Paragraph 1. The defendant shall 
       plead guilty to all counts of the 
       indictment currently pending 
       against him in the United States 
       District Court for the Eastern 
       District of New York.


INT. U.S. ATTORNEYS OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

OFF A COOPERATION AGREEMENT, we find --

-- Nolan Drager, Lucas Solomon, Rochelle Applebaum and 
Agent Denham all back at the conference table, reading 
copies of the same contract.  Lucas does so aloud:

                 LUCAS SOLOMON
       Paragraph 2.  The defendant shall 
       provide information regarding all 
       criminal activities of the 
       defendant and others from June 
       1st, 1990, onwards.  Paragraph 3.  




                                                      LUCAS SOLOMON 
       The defendant shall participate in 
       undercover activities pursuant to 
       the instructions of the FBI, 
       including wearing a recording 
       device, also known as a wire, in 
       conjunction with the investigation 
       of securities fraud.  Paragraph 4.  
       The defendant must not commit, or 
       attempt to commit, any further 
       crimes.

Jordans here, too, looking miserable.  He stops Lucas.

                 JORDAN
       Lemme just sign the fucking thing.

He signs the fucking thing.


INT. U.S. ATTORNEYS OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY



Jordan sits alone, finishes writing a long list of names 
on a yellow legal pad.

                 JORDAN 
       For the next six hours, I came up 
       with a list.  Friends, enemies, 
       business associates, anybody whod 
       ever known me or taken so much as 
       a stock tip.  The first name on 
       the list was Donnies.  

And as Jordan heaves a huge sigh, were suddenly...



INT. FBI OFFICE - DAY  (OCT 98) 

Agent Denham tapes a recorder to Jordans inner thigh, 
runs a microphone wire up his chest. Agent Hughes 
watches.

                 AGENT DENHAM
       Talk normally, breathe normally, 
       within five minutes youll forget 
       you even have it on.  

Jordan nods, buttons up his shirt.



INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - BULLPEN - DAY  (OCT 98)  



Wearing a suit and tie, Jordan walks in to the bullpen, 
where the Brokers spot him, giving him a standing 
ovation.  He forces a smile, waves to the crowd.

As Robbie and Chester Ming look on, Jordan forces a smile 
as he approaches Donnie, who gives him a hug. 


                                     


INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - JORDANS OFFICE - DAY   



Jordan and Donnie sit at the coffee table over takeout 
sushi. 

                 JORDAN
       The trial wont be for months,   
       so obviously Ill be counting on 
       you to pick up the slack.  

                 DONNIE
       Whatever you need, bro.  You know 
       that.

Jordan reaches in his jacket for a yellow slip of PAPER. 

                 JORDAN
       And you know how much that means 
       to me.  Hey, you know what I 
       wanted to ask you?  

Jordan catches Donnies eye, pushes the PAPER over in 
front of him.  

                 JORDAN 
       The Steve Madden deal, did he  
       ever come through on that?  

Donnie looks down at the paper, reads Jordans writing: 
DONT INCRIMINATE YOURSELF.  IM WEARING A WIRE.

                 JORDAN 
       Remember he was supposed to kick 
       back like four mil from that one 
       account?  

                 DONNIE
       Uh... tell you the truth I was so 
       fucked up, I dont really remember 
       anything about that.

Donnie slips the paper in his jacket, gives Jordan a   
look -- Thank you.  Jordan nods.   

                 JORDAN
       Well if you talk to him, let me 
       know.  You want the last 
       yellowtail?

       

                 DONNIE
	Why not?
                
			 JORDAN 
       And thus began my career as a 
       government cooperator.  I was a 
       rat... 


                                     


INT. JORDANS ESTATE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY  (NOV 98) 



Jordan lays alone, asleep in bed.  We hear the DOORBELL. 

                 JORDAN 
       But I wasnt losing any sleep  
       over it. 

After a few beats, Violet knocks, enters.  Jordan stirs. 

                 VIOLET
       Im sorry, Mr. Jordan.  You got a 
       visitor.  



INT. JORDANS ESTATE - FOYER - DAY  (NOV 98)



Jordan descends the stairs in sweats and T-shirt.  Agents 
Denham and Hughes are waiting.



                 AGENT DENHAM
       I need you to get dressed.

                 JORDAN
       Why?  Whats going on? 

                 AGENT DENHAM
       Youre going to jail.

Agent Denham holds up the slip of yellow paper that 
Jordan gave to Donnie.  And on Jordans look...

                 JORDAN 
       Donnie Azoff, my partner.  My best 
       friend.  



EXT. JORDANS ESTATE - DAY  

A tractor-trailer is parked out front as a group of 
MOVERS carry out paintings and antique furniture under 
the supervision of several FBI Agents in windbreakers.

                 JORDAN 
       After months of legal wrangling,  
       I was finally sentenced to prison.  

WE SEE Jordans various cars -- Porsche, Mercedes, 
Ferrari, BMW -- loaded onto a large transport vehicle.



INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - BULLPEN - DAY 

Jordan stands addressing his 700 Brokers.  WE SEE the 
eager young FACES, hanging on his every word.



                 JORDAN 
       I gave up everyone, and in return 
       got three years in some hellhole 
       in Nevada Id never even heard of.  
       Like Mad Maxd said, the 
       chickensd come home to roost.  
       Whatever the fuck that means.



INT. FEDERAL COURTROOM - QUEENS - DAY  (MAR 99)


Sentencing.  Jordans mother is there, tears in her eyes.

                 NOLAN DRAGER
       I hope your Honor would agree that 
       Mr. Belfort has distinguished 
       himself in terms of his 
       cooperation in this white collar 
       fraud.  Mr. Belfort has helped the 
       government win convictions over 
       two dozen serious offenders and 
       helped them recover millions of 
       dollars to be made available for 
       restitution to the victims.

                 HON. RAYMOND SAMITZ
       The sentence of the court shall be 
       48 months in Federal Prison. 
           (pause)
       Please remand the defendant.

Max rolls his eyes: Jordans so guilty it hurts. As 
Jordan is led away by GUARDS...



INT. STRATTON OAKMONT - DAY

Donnie sits in his office, hears something -- a small 
army of FBI AGENTS, led by Agents Denham and Hughes, 
arrest half the office: Sea Otter, Robbie, Kimmie, etc.. 
As the FBI cleans house, Donnie sits on his couch. 

INT. SUBWAY - DAY (MAR 99)

CLOSE ON DENHAM, reading a New York Times article on 
Jordans sentencing.  He looks satisfied with his 
accomplishment, until he looks up...

... and realizes hes right where Jordan said hed be: 
commuting home on the subway, like any other piker.



INT. PRISON VAN - DAY (MAR 99)



Jordan rides in back, stares out the window, thinking 
about all hes done.  The van stops as it arrives at the 
PRISON GATE.

                 JORDAN 
       Im not ashamed to admit, when we 
       arrived to prison, I was 
       absolutely terrified...

                 GUARD 
       Belfort!  Fuckin move!

Jordan leaps to his feet.

                 JORDAN 
       I neednt have been.



EXT. MINIMUM C PRISON - DAY (SPRING 2000)



A tennis ball hits pavement and WE PAN UP TO JORDAN, in 
prison fatigues but playing doubles with three other 
PRISONERS, all white middle-aged EXECUTIVE TYPES.

                 JORDAN
       Sorry, just out.  What is that, 
       forty-thirty?

As the game continues, Jordan serving, the CAMERA PULLS 
UP TO SEE THE WHOLE PRISON YARD: one group of inmates 
does Tai Chi while another has formed a book club.

                 JORDAN 
       For a brief, fleeting moment, Id 
       forgotten I was rich and lived in 
       America.

BLACK OUT.



INT. HOTEL BANQUET HALL - EARLY 2000S - DAY 



CLOSE ON A MOVIE SCREEN: DIFFERENT INTERVIEWS...

                 AFRICAN KID
       I watch him speak and what he says 
       is motivational about life.  He 
       tells about life and how you can 
       be more rich.

                 CHINESE KID
       He is going to teach us how to be 
       successful, how to set our goals. 

                 INDIAN KID
       I will build my future by using 
       Jordan Belfort as my mentor.

                 MEXICAN KID
       Choosing what is good from him and 
       being a millionaire. 

Two hundred people attend Jordans Straight Line 
Persuasion seminar, watching a massive screen (on which 
these KIDS have appeared).

ON-SCREEN: THE JB LOGO APPEARS, FOLLOWED BY CLIPS OF 
JORDAN giving seminars in different locations (see 
addendum below), edited in with footage of looming 
economic uncertainties.  

Then: a MAN WITH A MIC steps out...

                 MAN WITH A MIC
       Ladies and gentlemen, please join 
       me in welcoming to Auckland, New 
       Zealand... Mr. Jordan Belfort!

BIG APPLAUSE as Jordan takes the stage, waving.  This 
might go on a while.  If so, there COULD be TITLES:
  Jordan Belfort spent 22 months in federal prison nd paid $100,000,000 in fines.

THEN: His cellmate was, no fucking joke, Tommy Chong. Since his release, hes become a multi-millionaire again as a motivational speaker.

When the applause finally dies down...


...Jordan doesnt speak.  Instead he walks down to the 
front row of his audience, studying faces.  He picks one.   *
Takes a pen from his coat and offers it to him.


                 JORDAN
       Sell me this pen.

The Kiwi, embarrassed, takes a moment, then:

                 KIWI IN AUDIENCE
       Well, its a good pen, its a 
       ballpoint --

Jordan takes the pen back with a smile.  Hands it to the 
next person.

                 JORDAN
       Sell me this pen.

As the next person tries...

WE RAKE ALONGSIDE HIS AUDIENCE, transfixed, desperate for 
Jordans knowledge, desperate to be molded, to be rich...

                 JORDAN 
       Sell me this pen...Sell me this 
       pen... Sell me this pen...Sell me 
       this pen...

FADE OUT.

                               *
