             KARAOKE ANNOUNCER
      Lets give a hand to Rodney!

Scattered APPLAUSE and LAUGHTER.

             KARAOKE ANNOUNCER
      Next up, weve got a little lady 
      named...KATE!

Joyful APPLAUSE.

             BAR VOICES
      Yeah, Kate!

THE OPENING MUZAK STRAINS OF A KARAOKE SONG TO BE 
DETERMINED 

INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT

FADE IN:


CLOSE ON: KATE HANNAH -- late-20s, pretty and wholesome and, 
oh yeah, piss drunk. She stands on a tiny

KARAOKE STAGE

in the far corner of a half-empty dive bar.

Kate holds a MICROPHONE and dances as she SINGS a bad karaoke 
version of SONG TO BE DETERMINED. What Kate lacks in talent 
she more than makes up for with charm and enthusiasm. 

At a table near the stage is --

-- CHARLIE HANNAH: Kates husband, late-20s, scruffy but 
handsome, also pretty damn drunk. He enthusiastically claps 
and points to Kate, making up a cheering section along with --

-- OWEN HANNAH -- Charlies younger brother, early-20s -- 
who sings along with --

-- the small but energetic CROWD.

Kate begins to ramble between verses -- and gleefully points 
to Charlie and Owen. For the moment, this drunk girl is the 
Queen of Karaoke.

LATER


Kate finishes the song and drunkenly tumbles off the stage to 
join Charlie and Owen.

             CHARLIE
      That was so good, baby!

             KATE
      Bullshit.

             CHARLIE
      Im serious. You sing like an angel 
      -- a drunk angel.

Owen and Kate LAUGH.

             KATE
      If you were writing about my 
      performance for your blog, what 
      would you say?

             CHARLIE
      Id say that, uh...my wife is the 
      sexiest, most amazing woman alive.

             KATE
      That would be such a shitty article 
      -- nobody would read it.

Kate and Charlie laugh and kiss -- and then Kate glances at 
Owen and makes a puppy dog face.

             KATE 
        (to Owen)
      Aw...we need to find you a lady, 
      Owen.

             OWEN
      Yeah -- Ive been trying to flirt 
      with the bartender, but...I cant 
      tell.

Owen motions to the --

-- FEMALE BARTENDER, early 20s.

             KATE
      Shes hot! What cant you tell? 

             OWEN
      She looks like she could kick my 
      ass. No way would she go for a guy 
      like me. 

             KATE
      Youre being a little girl -- just 
      go talk to her.

             OWEN
        (clearly shy)
      I dont know...forget about it.

             KATE
        (not going to take no 
         for an answer)
      Ill take point -- follow me.

Kate stumbles to the bar. Charlie and Owen follow. Kate puts 
her arms around Owen and gets the attention of the bartender.

             KATE 
      I want to buy a gimlet for me and a  
      double-shot of whiskey for my 
      brother-in-law cause hes had a 
      hard week.

             FEMALE BARTENDER
      Kay.

The bartender quickly pours the drinks.

             FEMALE BARTENDER 
      Thats fifteen.

             KATE
      Wait -- dont you wanna know what 
      happened to him?

The bartender rolls her eyes and checks around the bar to see 
if there are other customers. Its pretty dead -- so she 
listens.

             FEMALE BARTENDER
        (unenthused)
      What happened?

             KATE
      He just got back from England -- 
      because he went there for a girl! A 
      preppy, bitchy girl. Diane 
      Court...that was her name. He loved 
      her so much that he went with her 
      because she had a fellowship or 
      something. He gave up being a 
      kickboxer. A kickboxer! 
        (sad) 
      And she dumped him.


The bartender sizes up Owen. The trio waits with anticipation 
to hear her response, which is --


             FEMALE BARTENDER
        (to Owen)
      You kickbox?

             OWEN
        (caught in the headlights)
      Yeah.

And...thats all Owens got.

             KATE
        (jumping in)
      And he teaches kids at the 
      kickboxing studio. Oh, theyre so 
      cute!

The bartender glances back to Owen.

             OWEN
        (finally)
      A lot of em dont have parents -- 
      so...its kinda more than just a 
      teacher/student thing. 
        (beat)
      I know it sounds silly, but I feel 
      responsible for them -- like...
        (emotional)
      ...I could be their parent.

Kate slides down the bar to Charlie.

             KATE
        (hushed)
      I think I got him laid.

             CHARLIE
      Yeah?

             KATE
      She seems totally game.

             CHARLIE
      Sure she just didnt want to get 
      into your pants?

Kate rolls her eyes.

             KATE
      I think Im done for the night. 

             CHARLIE
      Yeah?

Owen wanders over, dejected.

             OWEN
      Shes seen Say Anything.

             CHARLIE
      Eh, well...whatre you gonna do, 
      huh?
        (beat) 
      Wanna drive us home?

             KATE
	No -- he needs to keep working it! 
      You guys stay here.

             CHARLIE
      I dont want to watch my brother 
      not score. I want to go to bed with 
      you and...
        (whispered into Kates 
         ear)
      ...you know.

             KATE
      Ill be home when you get there. We 
      can you know then.

             OWEN
        (to Charlie)
      Yeah, man -- you dont have a job 
      to wake up for in the morning or 
      anything.

             CHARLIE
      Writing is a job! Not having to 
      report to an office only makes work 
      harder. 
        (to Kate)
      Baby, you drank a lot. I think Owen 
      should take us home -- youre too 
      drunk to drive.

             KATE
      Sos Owen. 
        (suddenly focused)
      Im not that drunk. Besides, you 
      know I focus when I drive -- it 
      sobers me up.

             CHARLIE
      Tell that to the cops. 


Kate kisses Charlie and hugs Owen.

Beat.

             KATE
        (to Charlie)
      I love you, baby. Ill be waiting 
      for you in a nice warm bed. You 
      have exactly one mission: get your 
      brother laid -- and dont talk to 
      any other women.

             CHARLIE
      That sounds like two missions.

             KATE
      No, its just one.

             CHARLIE
        (to Owen)
      It kinda sounded like two, right?

             OWEN
        (nodding)
      It did.

Kate grins and slowly backs away towards the door.

             KATE
        (really fast)
      GoodbyeIloveyouboth!

EXT. KARAOKE BAR - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Kate stumbles out of the bar and hears a GROAN. She glances 
over and sees:

A drunk woman -- FREDA, 30s -- sitting on the curb. She MOANS 
again.

Kate glances around the parking lot. Nobody else but her and 
Freda.

             KATE
      You okay?

             FREDA
        (quick)
      Yeah. Are you?

             KATE
        (taken aback)
      Um...sure.

             FREDA
      Good. 
        (whispers) 
      Hey, Im not really okay.

             KATE
      Oh...

             FREDA
      My bitch sister just took off and 
      left me here so she could hook up 
      with some asshole. Now what am I 
      supposed to do? Huh? I dont have a 
      car here.

             KATE 
      I guess I could...

             FREDA
      Youll give me a ride? Oh my god! 
      Thank you!

Freda gets up quickly -- and almost falls over.

             KATE
      I was gonna say call you a cab, 
      cause, you know -- I dont even 
      know you. 

             FREDA
      Its not far. Please? Pretty 
      please...?

Kate looks dismayed. Not sure what to do.

INT./EXT. SUBARU (MOVING) - NIGHT 

 CUT TO:


The car passes through Chinatown on its way downtown.

Kate drives with Freda in the passenger seat. Freda glances 
down at the floor and notices a FLASK.

             FREDA
      You know, you shouldnt drink and 
      drive.

             KATE
      I wasnt --

             FREDA
      Just kidding. Can I have a sip?

Kates speechless.

             FREDA 
      Im really thirsty.

             KATE
      Its, uh...whiskey.

             FREDA
      Fuck yeah, its whiskey! I love 
      whiskey. Youre the real thing, 
      huh? A hardcore drinking bitch like 
      me! 

Freda takes a swig from Kates flask.

             KATE
      I dont know. No.

             FREDA
      Can I smoke in your car?

             KATE
        (slightly annoyed)
      Okay, fine -- go ahead. Can you 
      just roll down the window?

             FREDA
      Of course -- Im not uncivilized.

Freda takes out a --

-- CRACK PIPE and lights it, deeply inhaling crack smoke.

             KATE
        (in disbelief)
      WHOA! 

Kate immediately pulls the car over.

             KATE 
      Not what I thought you meant.

             FREDA
      Want a hit?

             KATE
      No, I...is that pot?

             FREDA
        (as though its a 
         ridiculous question)
      Of course not! What do I look like? 
      A stoner?

             FREDA 
        (beat) 
      Its crack. 

             KATE
      Oh, shit! No...no thank you.

             FREDA
      Cmon -- its good crack.

             KATE
      I dont, um...Ive never smoked 
      crack.

             FREDA
        (surprised)
      Really? This stuff is the truth -- 
      and itll sober you up. 

             KATE
      Uh...I think you should go.

             FREDA
      Im not getting out in the middle 
      of nowhere. Do you know what could 
 happen to me all alone out here at 
      night?

             KATE
      I dont know -- people might offer 
      you crack?

             FREDA
      Seriously? Its not a big deal -- 
      just take a little hit.

Kate and Freda stare at each other. A stand-off.

             KATE
      I said no.

             FREDA
      One hit wont hurt you. Itll sober 
      you up. 

Kate glances at the pipe, which Freda wiggles in front of 
her.

             FREDA 
        (high-pitched cartoon 
         voice)
      Smoke me!

Kate LAUGHS.

             KATE
      One puff. Then we are both going 
      home.

Freda nods. Long beat.

             KATE 
      Fine.

Freda puts the pipe into Kates lips and lights it. Kate 
sucks in crack smoke. Her eyelids flutter. 

             FREDA
      Youve got money, right?


EXT. DOWNTOWN - STREET - NIGHT


Near some TENTS, CARDBOARD BOXES, and SHOPPING CARTS --

-- Kate smokes crack with FREDA and TWO OLDER MEN. They pass 
around TWO PIPES.

LATER

Freda is passed out on a SLEEPING BAG on the sidewalk.

Kate is animatedly telling a story to the two guys -- whore 
still smoking crack.

             KATE
        (mile-a-minute fast)
      ...cause I feel like I understand 
      what its like to be homeless, ya 
      know? I mean, if you didnt know 
      me, if we hadnt connected tonight, 
      you might think: Theres some 
      upper-middle-class, NPR listening, 
      self-congratulatory, insulated, 
      lazy liberal bitch. Probably never 
      had to worry about anything. But 
      thats not true at all! I grew up 
      poor, man. Single mother. 
      McDonalds used to have one day a 
      week where they sold 29 cent 
      hamburgers, and another day where 
      they had 39 cent cheeseburgers. My 
      mom and me would go there and shed 
      get twenty burgers -- that was the 
      limit, probably set up for folks 
      just like us -- and then shed put 
      em in the freezer and wed 
      microwave em for dinner throughout 
      the week. 


             KATE 
      I was kinda overweight until high 
      school, to be perfectly honest. 
      Eating used to be my thing. When I 
      started drinking, though, I kinda 
      stopped eating so much.
        (back on track) 
      But anyway, the point is: You and 
      me, were not so different.

The two guys arent paying much attention to Kate. Theyre 
more concerned with their crack pipe.

EXT. DOWNTOWN - SIDEWALK - DAWN

Kate is asleep on the curb. She looks awful. Suddenly, Kates 
eyes widen. She looks around at her surroundings, confused, 
then jumps to her feet.

EXT. DOWNTOWN - STREETS - DAWN

Kate runs through the streets.


EXT. DOWNTOWN - STREETS - DAWN

We TRACK along with Kate as she dashes past various 
buildings.

EXT. DOWNTOWN - STREET - DAWN

We stare down a long, empty street, the downtown SKYSCRAPERS 
towering in the distance. From out of nowhere -- 

-- Kate appears at the end of the street and sprints towards 
the camera.

A LEGEND APPEARS OVER THE IMAGE OF KATE RUNNING:

SMASHED


INT./EXT. SUBARU (MOVING) - DAWN


Kate drives -- a paranoid expression on her face and her 
hands tightly gripping the steering wheel. She glances down 
at --

-- her CELL PHONE in the passenger seat. 21 missed calls.

She passes various sites on her way from downtown to Highland  *

Park.

EXT. KATE & CHARLIES HOUSE - MORNING


Kate slowly pulls into the driveway of a small, cute house.

INT. KATE & CHARLIES HOUSE - LIVING ROOM/HALLWAY/KITCHEN - 

MORNING

Kate walks into the kitchen to find --

-- Charlie asleep at the kitchen table. CELL PHONE next to 
his head. Empty BEER BOTTLES litter the table.

Kate tip-toes across the kitchen.

Charlie quickly jerks up.

             CHARLIE
        (confused)
      Huh?!

             KATE
      Shhh...its okay, baby. Go back to 
      sleep.

             CHARLIE
      What happened? I came home and you 
      were gone and I waited and waited.

             KATE
      Its a long story. 

             CHARLIE
      I was worried. I kept calling you.

             KATE
      I ended up...

Charlie SNIFFS Kate.

             CHARLIE
      You smell funny. What do you smell 
      like?

             KATE
      I fell asleep in my car. Near the 
      bar. I was too drunk to drive.


             CHARLIE
      So, why didnt you come back or 
      call me? 

             KATE
      Charlie -- 
         (beat)
      -- Im fine.

             CHARLIE
      Well, maybe Im not. I worry, baby. 
      I love you -- and you know how you 
      get sometimes.

             KATE
      I love you too. But Im home. Its 
      over. I gotta get to work.

             CHARLIE
      I cant be worried about you all 
      the time.

Kate rubs Charlies hair and kisses his forehead.

             KATE
      Dont worry so much. Im fine. 
        (beat) 
      Cmon -- let me get you to bed.

             CHARLIE
      Im up now -- how bout I make us 
      bacon and egg sandwiches?

Kate smiles.

             CHARLIE 
        (knows hes got her)
      Magic words.

INT. KATE & CHARLIES HOUSE - BATHROOM - MORNING


Kate takes a shower -- while she drinks a BEER.

Gets dressed. 

Puts on make-up.


INT. KATE & CHARLIES HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

Kate walks into the kitchen, ready to go. Charlie is at the 
stove, cooking bacon and eggs. He hands Kate a MUG OF COFFEE 
and gestures to the table -- where theres a CHECK.

             CHARLIE
      Check for your moms on the table.

             KATE
      Thanks, baby.

Kate takes a sip of coffee.

             KATE 
      Why does the coffee taste so much 
      better when you make it?

             CHARLIE
      Because I make it with love -- and 
      bacon.

Kate LAUGHS and kisses Charlie.

INT./EXT. SUBARU (MOVING) - DAY


Kate takes a right on a STREET and then pulls into the

PARKING LOT AT AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

Shes about to get out, but then notices...

...the FLASK on the floor.

A FEW MOMENTS LATER

Kate chugs whats left in the flask.

ACROSS THE PARKING LOT

MR. DAVIES -- the assistant principal, early-40s, slightly 
nerdy but not bad looking, watches --

-- Kate drink in her car.

CHILDREN pass by in the distance.

Mr. Davies takes a beat, but instead of saying anything he 
walks away through the parking lot. 

Kate doesnt notice shes been seen.

INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY

Kate stands next to a CHALKBOARD in front of a class of THIRD 
GRADERS. Shes really animated -- doing her game show 
hostess schtick.

On the chalkboard are the letters: AN

             KATE
        (to the class)
      Now, if I add a C, what word do I 
      have?

A STUDENT raises her hand.

             KATE 
      Yes, Hillary?

             HILLARY
      Can?

             KATE
      Thats correct! Can. Youve won an 
      all-expenses paid trip to the 
      blackboard, Hillary!

Hillary hesitates. She looks embarrassed.

             KATE 
      Cmon...theres a washer-dryer 
      combo in it for you.

Hillary shuffles up to the board and writes CAN.

             KATE 
      Great job, Hillary -- lets give 
      her a round of applause!

The class APPLAUDS.

Hillary smiles and goes back to her seat.

             KATE 
      Can anyone use can in a sentence?

A student -- ANGELA -- raises her hand.

             KATE 
      Yes?

             ANGELA
      Hurry up in there -- I gotta use 
      the can!

The students GIGGLE.

             KATE
        (quickly moving on)
      Wonderful, Angela. You get a Camaro 
      with flames painted on the hood. 

The students CHEER.

             KATE 
      Now -- 
        (to the class) 
      -- whats another word I could make 
      by adding a letter to an?

Nobody raises their hand.

             KATE 
      Cmon...

Finally, a student in the back -- RAMON -- raises his hand.

             KATE 
      Yes -- Ramon?

             RAMON
      P.

             KATE
      P...okay, what word would that make 
      if I added a P?

             RAMON
      Um...pan?

             KATE
      Pan! Thats right. Ramon 
      Martinez...COME ON DOWN!

Ramon walks up and begins to write PAN.

             KATE 
      Wow! Just look at that excellent 
      penman --

Kate stops suddenly and raises her hand to her mouth. She 
quickly runs behind her desk, leans over, and discretely --

-- VOMITS on the floor! 

Ramon -- whos just inches from the pool of vomit -- looks 
horrified.

Kate glances up from behind her desk to see --

-- the kids all make grossed-out faces and say things like --

             KIDS
      EW! GRODY! GROSS! YUCK! IT SMELLS 
      LIKE CHEESE! SLOPPY JOE! GRANDPA! 
      SHRIMP! BACON!

Embarrassed, Kate quickly gets TISSUES from her desk and 
begins cleaning up the mess.

             KATE
        (to the class)
      Im so sorry you had to see that.

HILLARY stands up.

             HILLARY
      Mrs. Hannah -- are you pregnant?

             KATE
      What?

             HILLARY
      My mommy threw up when she was 
      pregnant with my little sister. Are 
      you pregnant?


Some of the kids begin WHISPERING (saying things like Ooh! 
Shes gonna have a baby.).

             RAMON
      Are you?

Kate seems flustered and says --

             KATE
      Yes.

INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - PRINCIPALS OFFICE - DAY


Kate sits across a desk from --

-- PRINCIPAL BARNES: female, early 50s, stern, scattered, 
and clearly a softy at heart, she wears a pair of GLASSES 
around her neck.

             PRINCIPAL BARNES
      Vice Principal Davies will be 
      looking after your students for the 
      rest of the day -- so you dont 
      need to worry about that.

             KATE
      Oh, thats really good to know. 
      Ill have to thank him. 
        (beat) 
      I just feel awful for getting sick 
      in front of my students.

             PRINCIPAL BARNES
      Oh, please -- theyre troopers. Im 
      sure theyve seen plenty worse.
        (beat)
      So -- how long have you been 
      pregnant?

             KATE
      Um...its the first trimester.

             PRINCIPAL BARNES
      Well, its very exciting. You must 
      be thrilled.

             KATE
        (nods)
      Uh-huh.
         

             PRINCIPAL BARNES
      Can I ask a...personal question?

             KATE
      Okay.

             PRINCIPAL BARNES
      Hows it...
        (beat)
      ...going for you?

             KATE
      Huh?

             PRINCIPAL BARNES
      The pregnancy, I mean. 

Kates not sure how to respond.

             PRINCIPAL BARNES 
      Having kids wasnt in the cards for 
      me. I came close, but...

Principal Barnes drifts off into thought for a moment, then 
catches herself and quickly shifts gears.

Beat.

             PRINCIPAL BARNES 
      ...I mean, its like Ive got a 
      couple hundred kids here -- 
        (forces a laugh) 
      -- but...I dont fool myself. Its 
      not the same.

             KATE
        (considers her reply)
      Well...its hard to explain.

             PRINCIPAL BARNES
      Of course...

             KATE
      I wouldnt call it a burden, but --

             PRINCIPAL BARNES
      Its a responsibility.

             KATE
      Yeah. Exactly.

             PRINCIPAL BARNES
        (nods)
      Youre so lucky. 
        (beat) 
      Can I...touch it?

             KATE
      Um, I dont...okay -- but it sleeps 
      a lot.

             PRINCIPAL BARNES
      Of course.

             KATE
      Like...a lot.

Principal Barnes gets up and kneels next to Kate. She places 
her hand on Kates belly and closes her eyes.

             PRINCIPAL BARNES
        (whispers)
      Hello in there. Can you hear me? 
      Youre a tiny miracle. Did you know 
      that? A miracle.

Principal Barnes looks up at Kate and smiles -- with tears in 
her eyes.

INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

Kate walks down the hall and comes to the door of her 
classroom. Through the glass she sees --

-- Mr. Davies. He notices Kate and smiles (the concerned 
smile you give someone right after theyve publicly 
embarrassed themselves).

Kate mouths the words --

             KATE
        (silent)
      Thank you.

-- and gestures come here.

Mr. Davies gestures to the class that hell be right back -- 
before he walks out to talk to Kate. Hes got a slightly 
nervous demeanor -- somewhere between I never became 
comfortable talking to women and Aspergers.

             MR. DAVIES
      Is everything, um...okay, Mrs. 
      Hannah?

             KATE
      Yeah, well...Im really embarrassed 
      -- but I feel a lot better. And I 
      just wanted to say thank you.

Mr. Davies glances down the hall.

             MR. DAVIES
      Look -- Im not a fool. 
        (whispered) 
      I know you were drinking this 
      morning. 

Kate looks shocked.

             MR. DAVIES 
      I saw you. 

             KATE
        (taken aback)
      Oh, no, I...

             MR. DAVIES
      Drinking when youre pregnant is 
      really dangerous.

             KATE
      I know that! Oh, God, I... 
        (long beat) 
      ...listen -- Im not actually 
      pregnant.

             MR. DAVIES
      What? 

             KATE
      Im just really hung over. The kids 
      started asking me questions after I 
      vomited and I panicked.

             MR. DAVIES
      Oh. Thats...not good.

             KATE
      I know. I...please dont say 
      anything.

Mr. Davies looks torn, unsure how to respond.

             MR. DAVIES
      Just...go home. Get some sleep.

Before Kate can say a word, Mr. Davies heads back into the 
classroom.

INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - BATHROOM - DAY

Kate has her face fully in the sink while water runs over it 
and --

-- TWO LITTLE GIRLS curiously watch.

INT. NEIGHBORHOOD BAR - DAY

Kate and Charlie play POOL while splitting a PITCHER OF BEER. 
Its a bit early to be drinking, but hey -- why not?

             KATE
      I had such a crappy morning.

             CHARLIE
      Me too. I spent like three hours at 
      the post office trying to buy 
      stamps and stuff.

Kate takes a long sip of beer.


             KATE
      I told my class I was pregnant.

Charlie looks up at Kate with a beaming smile. He leans over 
and grabs her hand.

             CHARLIE
        (excited and sort of 
         confused)
      Oh, baby, thats --

             KATE
      Im not. Pregnant. So dont worry.

             CHARLIE
        (deflated)
      Oh. 
        (beat)
      Cause it would be great news -- if 
      it was true. 
        (beat) 
      Course then Id have to drink your 
      beer...

             KATE
      Well, it was a lie. I just lied to 
      my class. After barfing in front of 
      them.

             CHARLIE
        (cringes)
      Ooh...

             KATE
      Yeah, thats what they said. 
        (long beat) 
      Listen...I cant do this anymore.

A look of complete terror and confusion passes over Charlies 
face.

             CHARLIE
      What do you mean?

             KATE
      I dunno. I think I might...drink 
      too much. 

Charlie LAUGHS.

             CHARLIE
      Oh. That. Yeah...you kinda do.

Charlie swigs his beer.

             KATE
      I know I do -- I'm a fucking 
      mess...

             CHARLIE
      Baby -- thats not true. Youre 
      beautiful. And brilliant. And I 
      love you. I wouldnt be married to 
      a mess.

             KATE 
 I left work after puking in front 
 of little kids. And...now Im 
 drinking in the middle of the day.

             CHARLIE
      Well, those things happen 
      sometimes. 
        (beat) 
      I mean, they shouldnt happen all 
      the time, but...its the price of, 
      uh, truly living life.

             KATE
      Isnt that like a slogan for some 
      kind of beer or toothpaste or 
      something...?

             CHARLIE
      No. And its true -- you and me, 
      were not just some boring couple 
      in the suburbs who dont sleep with 
      each other and have nothing to talk 
      about except whatever TV show 
      theyre currently into. 
        (beat) 
      We, like...still know how to party.

             KATE
      Yeah...
        (beat)
      ...I think I need to slow down.
        (beat)
      And I might need help.

             CHARLIE
      Ill help you.

             KATE
      I know, but...I might need more 
      help. 

             CHARLIE
      Yeah? Like a therapist?

             KATE
      I dont know -- I just get stupid 
      when Im drunk, and Im drunk a 
      lot.

             CHARLIE
      We just like to have a good time.

             KATE
      Yeah, well...
        (beat) 
      ...youve gotta promise not to tell 
      this to anyone.

             CHARLIE
        (curious)
      I promise.

             KATE
      That includes Owen.

             CHARLIE
      Of course.

             KATE
      Well, last night I kinda, um...
        (hushed)
      ...smoked some crack.

             CHARLIE
      WHAT?! 

Some bar patrons glance at Kate and Charlie.

             KATE
      After I left the bar, I, uh, picked 
      up this drunk girl and...I dont 
      really remember what came next, but 
      I ended up smoking crack with her.

             CHARLIE
        (confused)
      Uh...hows that even happen? 
        (beat) 
      You give someone a ride and she 
      rewards you with crack?!

             KATE
      Well...she seemed desperate. She 
      really needed a ride home.

             CHARLIE
      Where?

             KATE
      Downtown. I think she maybe lives 
      in...a tent?

             CHARLIE
      What?

             KATE
      Well...she might be homeless. Or a 
      prostitute. Or just some lost 
      sorority girl. 
        (thinks about it)
      To be honest, Im not sure...

             CHARLIE
        (disgusted)
      Oh, my god...you smoked crack with 
      some random stranger? Did 
      you...share a pipe?

Kate doesnt answer. She doesnt need to.

             CHARLIE 
      Ughhh...
        (beat)
      Just playing Devils advocate, but 
      maybe its the crack-smoking you 
      need help with and not the 
      drinking.

Kate gives Charlie a dirty look.

             CHARLIE 
      Im just saying.

             KATE
      The drinking led to the crack-
      smoking. The drinking leads to 
      everything stupid I do. 
        (beat) 
      I mean...can you even remember the 
      last time we had sober sex?

Charlie begins to answer, but then...goes blank. He tries to 
remember. And cant.

             CHARLIE
      Well chill out with the booze for 
      a while. We can just be wine-with-
      dinner people. 
        (beat) 
      Hows that sound?

EXT. STREET - DAY

Kate and Charlie joyfully ride BICYCLES home from the bar.

             CHARLIE
      Maybe you should go to, uh... one 
      of those meetings. They have em 
      over there. 

Charlie gestures to a 

BUILDING (could be a church or different type of building 
where AA meets).

Kate LAUGHS.

             KATE
      Yeah, right.

             CHARLIE
      Remember when I was shit-faced and 
      took that Q & A pamphlet from 
      there?

             KATE
        (laughs)
      Holy shit! And we answered yes to 
      like every question and at the end 
      it was like, If you answered yes 
      to any of these youre an 
      alcoholic!

             CHARLIE
      Yeah...
        (nostalgic)
      ...that was fun, wasnt it?

Kate smiles and nods.

             CHARLIE 
      Hey -- 

Charlie gestures to the street.

             CHARLIE 
      -- look out for that crack!

Kate looks down but sees nothing.

             KATE
      What crack?


             CHARLIE
      Oh, sorry -- I thought there was a 
      crack there...
        (grins)
      ...but you must have smoked it last 
      night.

Kate rolls her eyes -- and then jokingly swerves towards 
Charlie, trying to knock him over. He LAUGHS and speeds away. 
Kate chases after him.


INT. KATE & CHARLIES HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

While an old 70s R & B song plays on a RECORD PLAYER, which 
is next to STACKS AND STACKS OF RECORDS --

-- Kate and Charlie drunkenly slow dance, drink WINE, and 
LAUGH at an AA PAMPHLET.

             CHARLIE
      Have you missed days of work or 
      school because of drinking?

             KATE
      Absolutely.

             CHARLIE
      Do you envy people who can drink 
      without getting into trouble?

             KATE
      Envy isnt exactly the right 
      word...

             CHARLIE
      Do you have blackouts?

             KATE
      Yeah, but who doesnt?

             CHARLIE
      Has your drinking caused trouble 
      at home?

             KATE
      No! Were great.

             CHARLIE
      Yeah. Definitely. But we still had 
      a lot of yes answers.
        (refers to pamphlet)
      Yep...we still qualify as drunks. 

             KATE
      Im gonna go!

             CHARLIE
        (disbelief)
      Yeah, right.

             KATE
      No -- Im serious! Im gonna go. 
      What time is it?

             CHARLIE

      Eight.

Kate gets up.

             KATE
      See ya.

             CHARLIE
        (doesnt believe her)
      Uh-huh...

Kate takes a big sip of wine. 

             KATE
        (quite serious)
      This is me: going.

Charlie LAUGHS -- he doesnt buy it.

             CHARLIE
      Youve been boozing.

             KATE
      So? You should come too!

Charlie LAUGHS.

             CHARLIE
      Yeah, right. You cant go to AA 
      wasted. Its like a rule or 
      something.

             KATE
      Oh, yeah? Watch me!


INT. MEETING HALL - NIGHT

An AA meeting is in progress.

An OLDER WOMAN stands at the podium sharing her story. 


The room is filled with --

-- different groups of PEOPLE, all of whom sit with their 
own group, like a high school lunch room -- but the people 
are adults. There are distinct groups of --

-- PRETTY WOMEN --

-- OBSESSIVELY TATTOOED PEOPLE --

-- BUSINESSMEN --

-- and HIPSTERS.

As Kate -- whos slightly confused -- enters the building, a 
hip looking man -- DONOVAN, 30s -- stops her, extending his 
hand.

             DONOVAN
        (whispers)
      Hey, I'm Donovan. Welcome.

             KATE
      Hi Donovan -- Im Kate!

Donovan shushes Kate.

             DONOVAN
      You must be a newcomer, huh?

             KATE
      A what?

             DONOVAN
        (whispers)
      Um, I'm not really allowed to talk 
      to new chicks, but there are lots 
      of women here who can help you out.

             KATE
        (confused)
      Okay. 
        (beat) 
      Do I just sit wherever?

             DONOVAN
      The meeting already started so just 
      try to find a spot anywhere.

Kate drunkenly stumbles to the back of the room, saying 
things like sorry and I like that jacket as she takes a 
seat next to two very CLEAN CUT WOMEN.


As the woman at the podium continues to speak, the women next 
to Kate quietly try to welcome her.


             LILY
      Are you new?

             KATE
      To this? Yeah. Whys everyone 
      whispering?

             SHANA
      It's hard, huh?

             KATE
      I guess.

             LILY
      Everythings going to be fine. 
      Youre home.

Kate doesn't respond -- just looks around with the fear 
anyone would have if they felt they had just accidentally 
joined Jim Jones church.

LATER

The room is COMPLETELY FULL -- with over ONE-HUNDRED PEOPLE. 

The tattooed man stands at the podium.

             TATTOO MAN
      Not to embarrass anyone, but so 
      that we may get to know you better -
      - is there anybody here in their 
      first thirty days of recovery?

Several PEOPLE scattered throughout the room stand up and 
introduce themselves as alcoholics.

Kate stands up.

             KATE
      I'm Kate. I...I'm...I guess Im a 
      little drunk right now.

People burst into LAUGHTER.

             KATE 
      Do you want me to talk about my 
      childhood or something? 


             TATTOO MAN
        (painfully polite)
      You know, Kate, we actually ask 
      that you dont share if youve had 
      a drink or any mind-altering 
      substance in the past 24 hours.

             KATE
        (not listening)
      I can -- I kinda hate my dad and 
      dont talk to him. And my mom...oh, 
      man...I dont even know where to 
      start. Shes, like, stuck in the 
      80s and kind of a metalhead. Her 
      last boyfriend called himself a 
      drummer but really just gave drum 
      lessons to little kids and --

             TATTOO MAN
        (tries to shut Kate up)
      Welcome, Kate. 
        (forces a smile) 
      It gets better. 

             KATE
        (not picking up the hint)
      I like drinking is the thing. I 
      mean, I dont want to say you guys 
      are wrong or anything...

Kate nervously LAUGHS.

Some of the PEOPLE in the crowd look embarrassed for Kate.

             TATTOO MAN
      Thank you -- were all here to 
      help. We do have to move on, 
      though. 

The woman next to Kate gets her to sit back down.

             LILY
      Dont worry, sweetie -- therell be 
      plenty of time to tell your story.

A young woman -- AMBER, 22 -- approaches the podium.

             AMBER
      Hey, I'm Amber, alcoholic. I can't 
      really believe that it's been five 
      years. I mean, my life was a mess 
      back then. Now I'm back in school, 
      I have an amazing man, I love my 
      parents -- it's crazy...

             KATE
        (way too loud)
      How old is that girl?! Can she even 
      go to bars? 
        (to Amber)
      How old are you, Amber?

	SHANA
      Be respectful.

Kate seems surprised at being chastised.

             AMBER
        (gaining intensity)
      Um...okay? It's because I did the 
      work. I got down on my knees and 
      prayed every night! I went to a 
      meeting everyday! 

             KATE
      Everyday? 

             AMBER
      It wasn't easy, but I've gotta say, 
      I owe everything to AA. Well, AA -- 
      and God, of course!

The whole room APPLAUDS.

LATER

Everyone is standing, holding hands, and saying the SERENITY 
PRAYER.

             EVERYONE
      God grant me the serenity to accept 
      the things I cannot change -- 
      courage to change the things I can -
      - and wisdom to know the 
      difference. 

             KATE
      AMEN! 

Everyone turns and looks at Kate.

             KATE 
        (embarrassed)
      Okay...I think Im good.

Kate quickly leaves the meeting as clumsily as she arrived. 


EXT. KATE & CHARLIES HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT

Kate chugs frozen Margarita straight from a PITCHER.

             KATE
      So much for that.

Kate and Charlie stand in their backyard, which is criss-
crossed by WHITE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS and has some old LAWN 
FURNITURE.

They drunkenly play CROQUET.

             CHARLIE
      Was it a bunch of old biker guys?

             KATE
      No, it was...I don't know. 
      Enthusiastic people. A lot of 
      really ENTHUSIASTIC PEOPLE!

             CHARLIE
      Yuck -- I hate enthusiasm. I'm 
      sorry it wasn't cool. 

Charlie thinks for a moment.

             CHARLIE 
      I cant really imagine never 
      drinking. I guess I dont have to, 
      though -- 
        (beat) 
      -- youre the one with the problem.

Kate nods in agreement.

             CHARLIE 
      Hey -- I love you. I don't want you 
      to have to drink. 

             KATE
      I dont have to drink. 
        (beat) 
      I just really like to drink.

             CHARLIE
        (sincere)
      Good -- cause youre my favorite 
      person to drink with in the whole 
      damn world.

Charlie leans in to kiss Kate. They make out for a moment, 
and then Kate...

...BITES Charlies lip. Charlie pulls back, shocked. Kate  
grins mischievously.

             CHARLIE 
      Oh, no you didnt!

Charlie lunges at Kate, who dodges him and LAUGHS. Charlie 
dives and playfully tackles Kate. They begin to wrestle in 
the grass -- its cute and loving but perhaps a little too 
intense.

INT. KATE & CHARLIES HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Kate and Charlie are making out on the bed. Kate starts to 
unbutton Charlie's shirt. As it turns out, Charlies 
extremely drunk (and it's apparent in his movements and 
voice).

             CHARLIE
      Are you trying to have some sex?

Kate removes Charlie's pants and takes off her clothing. She 
climbs on top of him and --

-- they start having sloppy, drunk sex.

After a few beats, Kate notices that Charlie isn't moving. 
She looks down to discover that --

-- hes passed out. 

Kate pauses for a moment...then continues to ride her 
unconscious husband.

INT. KATE & CHARLIES HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT 

Kate drinks whats left in the TEQUILA BOTTLE as she 
drunkenly searches the fridge, counter, and cupboard for more 
booze. She finds a few sips here and there at the bottom of a 
couple BEER BOTTLES -- but she seems frustrated that there 
isnt more alcohol in the house. 

A FEW MOMENTS LATER

Kate puts on her slippers, robe and --

EXT. STREET - NIGHT


Kate drunkenly rides a BICYCLE down the street (still in her 
robe and slippers).

INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT


Kate tries to open the LOCKED glass fridge where the BEER is 
kept. After several attempts, she gives up and grabs TWO 
BOTTLES OF WINE from a shelf.

Kate sets the bottles on the counter.

The CLERK -- a tired looking man in his 30s -- looks at Kate 
with pity.

             CLERK
      You know I cant sell you this, 
      Kate.

An ELDERLY MAN -- shopping for frozen food -- glances over at 
Kate.

             KATE
      What? You cant tell Im 21? Come 
      on -- Im in here all the time. You 
      know me.

             CLERK
      Yes, I do, Kate. And I know youre 
      old enough -- but its too late.

The clerk holds up his WATCH (which reads 2:45).

             KATE
      Cmon -- we can just pretend its 
      before two...

Kate reaches down and tries to rewind the clerks watch.

             CLERK
        (not amused)
      Stop it.

             KATE
      Its just a little wine. Im not 
      driving or anything.

             CLERK
      I dont think so. Sorry.

Kate gives him a big, flirty smile.

             KATE
      Come on, dude -- Ill let you have 
      a sip if you want.

Kate tries to do a sexy dance.

             CLERK
      Its the law. I cant sell alcohol 
      after 2 a.m. You know that.

             KATE
      Why dont you give it to me, then? 
      That wouldnt hurt anything. A gift 
      -- because were friends.

             CLERK
      I could lose my job.

Kate doesnt have anything to say back -- so she glances at 
the Elderly Man in the frozen food section.



             KATE
        (to the elderly man; meant 
         to be a whisper, but way 
         too loud)
      You distract him, okay?!

The elderly man puts up his hands, not wanting any part of 
it.

             CLERK
      Look -- why dont you get a bottle 
      of water or a coffee or something 
      instead?

             KATE
      Water or coffee? Fuck you. What --
      just cause I wont suck your dick?

             CLERK
        (had enough)
      Oh my god. Okay, enough -- you 
      gotta go. 

Kate doesnt budge.

             CLERK 
      Seriously, Kate. You should go.

             KATE
      Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

Kate is hysterical and her eyes are starting to fill with 
tears.

             KATE 
      This is bullshit! 
        (beat) 
      I have to pee.


Kate runs down the aisle and tries to open the bathroom door -
- but its locked. She hides from view, and then squats down 
and begins to pull up her robe.


             CLERK
      What the fuck are you doing?!

             KATE
        (caught)
      I didnt mean to! Sometimes I just 
      have to pee really, really bad. 

             CLERK
        (frustrated)
      Get outta here NOW!

             KATE
        (pleads)
      Cmon...cant we drink together? 

The clerk clearly isnt going to budge. Kate nods, resigned, 
and then...

...grabs a BOTTLE OF WINE and dashes out the door.

EXT. L.A. RIVER - DAWN


Kate is passed out on the concrete bank of the Los Angeles 
River. The empty bottle of (screw top) wine is next to her. 

Kates bicycle lays in some weeds nearby.

A bird SQUAWKS.

Kate slowly wakes up, confused, and in a zombie-like state 
she gets up and trudges home, wheeling along her bike.

INT. KATE & CHARLIES HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING

Kate is awakened by the deafeningly loud ALARM CLOCK and the 
sound of a news radio ANNOUNCER. She looks at the clock and 
realizes that --

-- its 7:30. 

She jumps out of bed in a panic.

             KATE
      Charlie!

Kate pauses when she realizes her back is wet. She looks down 
at the bed, which is --

-- COMPLETELY SOAKED.

             KATE 
        (mumbled)
      Not again.

Half-asleep, Charlie rolls over onto the pee-soaked part of 
the bed.

             CHARLIE
      Come back to bed, baby.

             KATE
      I have to go to work. You snoozed 
      my alarm again. I'm gonna be late.

             CHARLIE
Well, you peed on me so I guess 
were even. 

             KATE
      I have a weak bladder.

             CHARLIE
      Well...I can't go to work like 
      this.

             KATE
      You work from our kitchen.

             CHARLIE
      Yeah, but changing the sheets is my 
      real job. 
        (beat) 
      Hey -- where were you last night?

             KATE
      Huh?

             CHARLIE
      I woke up at like 4 a.m. and you 
      were gone.

             KATE
      Where would I go at 4 a.m. alone? 
      You mustve been dreaming.

Kate then glances down and notices --

-- that HER FEET ARE COVERED IN DIRT AND GRASS. 

She pauses, slightly alarmed, but continues getting ready.

INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - BATHROOM - STALL - DAY

Kates on her knees, puking into a toilet.

A FEW MOMENTS LATER

Kate exits the stall to find --

-- Principal Barnes standing by the door.

             KATE
      I...

             PRINCIPAL BARNES
      I can only imagine the chemistry 
      experiment thats going on --

Barnes points at Kates stomach.

             PRINCIPAL BARNES 
        (smiles)
      -- in there.

INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY

Kate sits on a SMALL CHAIR reading a CHILDRENS BOOK to her 
class -- 

-- whore sitting Indian style in a semi-circle.

             RAMON
      Are you gonna have a boy or a girl?

             KATE
      I don't know yet.

             HILLARY
      When will you know?

             KATE
      Not until summertime. You guys will 
      be on vacation.

             RAMON
      If you have a boy what will you 
      name him?

             KATE
      Maybe...Woodrow Wilson?

             ANGELA
      That's a name for a man -- not a 
      baby!


The children LAUGH.

Kate LAUGHS too -- but looks a little freaked out.

INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - TEACHERS LOUNGE - DAY

Kate eats her PACKED LUNCH with Mr. Davies.

             KATE
      Thanks again for covering for me.

             MR. DAVIES
      I can't promise to cover for you 
      every time you get pregnant.

             KATE
      There won't be another time.

             MR. DAVIES
      I genuinely hope not. Look -- I 
      didnt tell Barnes, but if anything 
      like this happens again Ill have 
      to.

Mr. Davies smiles -- a sweet, genuine smile.

             MR. DAVIES 
      Okay...Kate?

             KATE
        (nodding)
      Okay...
        (not sure what to say)
      ...David?

Beat.

             MR. DAVIES
      Dave.

Kate tries to hold back a smile.

             MR. DAVIES 
      I know -- Dave Davies...yup...hah-
      hah. Anyway, uh, is everything okay 
      with you?

             KATE
      I dont know. 
        (beat)
      Um...no? 


             KATE 
      I puked in front of my class and 
      then told everyone Im pregnant. 
      Thats not really okay, huh?

             MR. DAVIES
      No, I dont think so.

             KATE
      I went to AA last night.

             MR. DAVIES
        (slightly uncomfortable)
      Oh, yeah? Whatd you think of it?

             KATE
      It was awful. I kept getting 
      shushed. 

             MR. DAVIES
      I dont normally tell people I work 
      with this... but --

Mr. Davies takes a COIN that says Nine Years out of his 
pocket and shows it to Kate.

             MR. DAVIES 
      -- Im a bit of an expert when it 
      comes to these things.

             KATE
        (shocked)
      You?

             MR. DAVIES
      Yeah, me. Ive lived a strange one. 
      Im nine years sober, AA and NA.
        (beat)
      I used to drink cocaine. 
        (off Kates shocked 
         expression) 
      Its really cheap in the 
      Philippines.


Mr. Davies takes a beat to think about what hes saying.

             MR. DAVIES 
      Listen, Kate. I know meetings can 
      be weird. Especially at first, but 
      if you want to...you never need to 
      feel like you have to...but the 
      ones I go to are pretty small. Nice 
      little groups. 
        (beat) 
      Id be happy to take you.

             KATE
      Maybe that would be good...I dont 
      know.

             MR. DAVIES
      No pressure, okay. That shit saved 
      my life, though. 

Principal Barnes walks in.

             MR. DAVIES 
        (switching gears)
      Well, Im scheduled to observe Ms. 
      Carols art class. Theyre making 
      macaroni art, so...Im pretty 
      stoked.

Mr. Davies gets up to leave -- discretely winking at Kate as 
he exits.

Principal Barnes watches Mr. Davies leave, a puzzled 
expression on her face.

             PRINCIPAL BARNES
        (to Kate)
      Mrs. Hannah -- Ive got something 
      for you...

Principal Barnes opens the MINI FRIDGE to reveal a huge jug 
of ORANGE JUICE.

             PRINCIPAL BARNES 
      Folic Acid! You need it now like 
      never before. 

             KATE
        (beat)
      Thanks.

             PRINCIPAL BARNES
      I bet your mother is over the moon, 
      huh? Probably planning you a baby 
      shower...?

             KATE
      Oh, well...she and I arent that 
      close.

             PRINCIPAL BARNES
      Oh, Im sorry. Well, listen -- any 
      motherly thing you need -- Im 
      here, okay?

Barnes hands Kate a large glass of juice.

             PRINCIPAL BARNES 
      Now drink up -- that baby in 
      theres thirsty!

             KATE
      Okay. 
        (takes a sip of orange 
         juice) 
      And...youre kinda the only person 
      at school -- besides Mr. Davies -- 
      who knows Im pregnant. Could 
      you...? 

             PRINCIPAL BARNES
      My lips are --

Principal Barnes mimes zipping her lips.

EXT./INT. KATE & CHARLIES HOUSE - LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - DAY


Kate walks in the front door to see  --

-- Charlie working on his computer. A BEER next to him. An 
old record PLAYS on the record player.

             KATE
      Hey...

             CHARLIE
      Howdy.

Kate collapses on the couch next to Charlie and kisses him.

             KATE
      How was your day? And whats that 
      smell?

             CHARLIE
      Eh -- alright. Couldnt find 
      oatmeal so I made ketchup soup.

             KATE
        (cringes)
      Charlie! You need to eat.

             CHARLIE
      What? Its tasty. 
        (beat)
      So...Im going to see that band 
      from Iceland with the triplets play 
      tonight. Want to come with me and 
      Owen to check it out?

             KATE
      Oh, that sounds fun, but...

             CHARLIE 
      Cmon -- Owen cant pick up girls 
      without you.

             KATE
      I dont know...this guy I work with 
      -- Mr. Davies --

             CHARLIE
      The Vice Principal?

             KATE
      Yeah -- turns out hes sober and 
      invited me to a meeting.

             CHARLIE
        (surprised)
      Wow, thats...uh, cool.

Charlie goes silent.

             KATE
      What?

             CHARLIE
      Nothing -- I just...I didnt think 
      you really loved the meeting you 
      went to yesterday. In fact, it 
      sounded like you hated it. So Im 
      kinda surprised youre going back.

             KATE
      Well...this is a smaller meeting. 
      It might be different. I dunno -- I 
      think I want to give it a fair 
      shot.

Charlie nods.

             KATE 
      Besides -- I was hammered last 
      night. 
        (beat)
      Go on and have fun out drinking 
      with Owen tonight. Seriously. Im 
      just gonna, you know, try something 
      different...

Charlie pulls Kate close to him.

             CHARLIE
      Im here for you, okay? Even though 
      I drink -- I could slow down if you 
      need me to. 
        (forces a smile) 
      Im sure I could.


EXT. CHURCH - AA MEETING ROOM - NIGHT


Kate approaches a small church.

Mr. Davies waits outside.

INT. CHURCH - AA MEETING ROOM - NIGHT - A FEW MOMENTS LATER

Mr. Davies walks Kate into a medium sized room where --

-- about TEN PEOPLE are getting coffee, talking, and setting 
CHAIRS IN A CIRCLE.

Kate looks around the room, scoping out the people, whore 
very different from the crowd at the previous nights meeting 
--

-- several BLUE COLLAR MEN --

-- JENNY: 40-ish, with dark hair and a confident, sort of 
tough demeanor --

-- a few OLDER PEOPLE, and a YOUNG COUPLE.

Mr. Davies directs Kate over to a table with COFFEE and 
COOKIES.

             MR. DAVIES
      This is a little more my speed. No 
      one here is the slightest bit hip.

             KATE
      Does everybody just...kinda, you 
      know -- talk here?

             MR. DAVIES
      Pretty much. Someone leads -- tells 
      their story. And then everyone else 
      shares -- talks.

             KATE
      So since youre taking me here does 
      that make you my sponsor?


             MR. DAVIES
      No -- I dont think I could do 
      that. 
        (off Kates expression)
      Cause, um...
        (nervously searches)
      ...well, it could get weird. But 
      Ill help you find one if you want.
        (gestures to the seats) 
      We should sit down.

Kate looks around the room at everyone taking their seats.

             KATE
        (takes a deep breath; to 
         Mr. Davies)
      I cant believe Im really here.

             MR. DAVIES
      It gets better. Weirder, maybe --
      but better.

LATER

The meeting has begun and everyone sits in a circle of 
chairs. 

Jenny is midway through her speech.

             JENNY
      ...all I knew about taking care of 
      myself was fucking people over and 
      lying to get by. I had no idea how 
      to even look for a normal job or 
      pay my bills on time -- or pay my 
      fucking bills at all. 
        (beat) 
      Now I pay my bills online.

The group CHUCKLES.

             JENNY 
      And I found a love in cooking. Ive 
      got my own catering business now. 
      And...maybe I just replaced alcohol 
      with chocolate chips and 
      cigarettes, but still...its been 
      years since I woke up in a park -- 
      in a different state.

LAUGHTER.

Kate leans in towards Mr. Davies and whispers -- 

             KATE
      I kinda like her.

             MR. DAVIES
      Sponsor potential?

Kate nods.

             MR. DAVIES 
      Get her number at break.

             KATE
      I feel like youre my wingman.

Kate grins at Mr. Davies, who smiles shyly and glances away.

LATER

An older man -- ARLO -- stands and announces.

             ARLO
      Arlo, Alcoholic. Therell now be a 
      ten minute break. Smoke em if you 
      got em.

As some of the PEOPLE go outside --

-- Kate walks over to Jenny, whos getting a cup of coffee.

             KATE
      Hey, I liked your speech.

             JENNY
      Thanks. All that dumb shit happened 
      so Im glad that now its at least 
      entertaining. 
        (beat) 
      Whats your name?

             KATE
      Kate. This is my first meeting. 
      Or... first meeting where Im not 
      wasted.

Jenny LAUGHS.

             JENNY
      Oh, yeah -- I remember doing some 
      of that.

             KATE
      I dont really know how this stuff 
      works. 

             KATE 
      But...could I get your number? I 
      mean, I may not need it, but...

             JENNY
      Yeah, of course. I can help explain 
      it to you -- and also, we can just 
      talk.

             KATE
      Okay. Yeah. 
        (beat)
      Youve been sober since you were 
      24? 

Jenny nods.

             KATE 
      That seems really young.

             JENNY
      I didnt have much of a choice -- I 
      crashed my car into a nursing home.
        (beat) 
      I think the break is just about 
      over. This meeting is the kind 
      where everyone can share. Sharing 
      always helps me, so...if its not 
      too weird -- try introducing 
      yourself and telling the group 
      whats going on.

LATER

Everyone is sitting down and sharing. The woman (TINA) next 
to Kate is finishing up.

             TINA
      ...anyway, thats where Im at 
      today. Thanks for listening.

Everyone looks at Kate.

             KATE
      Okay, um...hello. I'm Kate and...
        (long beat)
      ...I'm an alcoholic?

Kate nervously LAUGHS.

             GROUP
      Hi, Kate.

             KATE
      Sorry. I don't mean to laugh -- 
      it's just saying those words...
        (beat)
      ...I think I'm an alcoholic, but I 
      don't really know. I drink -- a 
      lot. I've always drank. Everyone I 
      know drinks a lot. I never really 
      thought I had a problem -- lately 
      though it seems like maybe I do. I 
      just want to be able to drink a 
      beer without it turning into twenty 
      -- or wetting my bed. 
        (beat) 
      It seems like every time I drink 
      something awful happens. All the 
      shit that I used to laugh off isn't 
      really funny anymore. The dumb 
      drunk stuff has gone from 
      embarrassing to scary. 
        (beat) 
      I'm kinda...scared. 

Kate stops. Looks around self-consciously. 

A SERIES OF short, quick scenes:

CUT TO BLACK.

FADE IN:

INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY

Kate sits at her desk grading papers. Kates hand has an 
uncontrollable tremble as she tries to carefully make red 
checks on students papers. Self-consciously, she steadies 
her right hand with her left.

FADE TO BLACK.

FADE IN:

INT. SUBARU (MOVING) - DAY


Kate shovels chocolate chips from the bag into her mouth 
while driving.

FADE TO BLACK.

FADE TO BLACK.

While Kate and Charlie eat dinner, Kate drinks WATER but 
focuses on Charlies glass of WINE and the slow, careful sips 
he takes.

FADE TO BLACK.

FADE IN:

loud the guys are.

FADE TO BLACK.

FADE IN:

Charlie sleeps on the other side of the bed as Kate writes in 
a notebook. Kate stops writing. She stares at Charlie as he 
sleeps. 

FADE TO BLACK.

FADE IN:

EXT. DOWNTOWN - DAY

Kate rides her bicycle hard. It might even be...exercise?

             MR. DAVIES
      How about ninety days?

FADE TO BLACK.

FADE IN:

INT. CHURCH - AA MEETING ROOM - NIGHT

EVERYONE is dressed differently, some people have different 
hair-cuts, etc.

Mr. Davies stands up, holding a PLASTIC CASE.

             MR. DAVIES
      Is there anyone here who has ninety 
      days of continuous sobriety?

Kate stands up -- she looks way more "together" than she did 
earlier. She gives Mr. Davies a hug -- and he hands her a 90 
DAY CHIP.

             KATE
      I'm Kate. I'm an alcoholic.

Everyone CLAPS. 

             EVERYONE
      Hi, Kate.

Kate sits down next to Jenny and gives her a hug.

             JENNY
        (whispered)
      Congratulations.


EXT. JENNYS CATERING BUSINESS - NIGHT

Kate -- who eats a piece of CAKE -- sits on a patio with 
Jenny, Mr. Davies, and several other PEOPLE from AA.

             JENNY
      I'm really proud of you, Kate.

             KATE
      I kinda can't believe it's been 
      ninety days. 
        (beat) 
      The longest I've gone since high 
      school without drinking was, like, 
      a week.

             MR. DAVIES
      My first three months were such 
      hell. I think I'm only sober today 
      because I just never want to go 
      through that again.

             KATE
      It's weird -- in after-school 
      specials the getting-sober part was 
      only like a minute of the movie and 
      suddenly...daddys all okay.

Several people LAUGH.

             KATE 
      But it's so fucking hard and weird 
      and suddenly I have all these other 
      problems now that drinking isn't 
      the problem.

             JENNY
      Like what?

             KATE
      Everything else. Work, my non-
      existent relationship with my 
      mom...

             JENNY
      When was the last time you saw her?

             KATE
        (tries to remember)
      A year, at least.

             JENNY
      Well...maybe its time.

             KATE
      Maybe. 
        (beat) 
      And then theres my marriage. I 
      mean, Charlies great. Really 
      great, hes supportive, especially 
      at first. Its strange, though. I 
      feel like alcohol was the thing 
      that connected us and now that I 
      dont drink we lead these two very 
      different lives. 
        (beat) 
      We havent slept together in 
      forever...
        (laughs)
      I haven't pissed myself in awhile, 
      though. So thats good.

             JENNY
      It takes time. 

Kate gives an exasperated look.


	JENNY 
        (half-stern cheerleader 
         tone)
      Keep working the steps. 
        (glances at her watch) 
      Lets grab coffee tomorrow, okay? I 
      should actually run you home now 
      and come back. I need to start 
      locking up.

             KATE
      I could stick around and help 
      you...

             MR. DAVIES
        (to Kate)
      I could take you home. 
        (off Kates reaction) 
      If you want.

INT./EXT. MR. DAVIES CAR - NIGHT


Mr. Davies pulls up to Kate's house.

Beat.

             MR. DAVIES 
      My ex-wife -- she doesn't drink -- 
      well, not like us, but as soon as I 
      got sober I started to change and 
      she just...didn't. 

             KATE
      I didnt know you were married.

             MR. DAVIES
      Yeah, I was married once -- 
        (laughs) 
      -- in my other life. But I 
      shouldn't be talking to you about 
      this stuff. 

             KATE
      Why?

             MR. DAVIES
      I dont know...

             KATE
      Because youre a dude we can't 
      talk? I don't get that "men stick 
      with men, women stick with women" 
      stuff.

             MR. DAVIES
      Well, if you were sitting where I'm 
      sitting you'd understand.

             KATE
      Are you trying to tell me that you 
      have a crush on me?

             MR. DAVIES
What am I, one of your students? 
      Crush?

             KATE
      Yeah, crush. 

             MR. DAVIES
        (long beat)
      I kind of do, yes. I have a crush 
      on you. I know that's wrong -- 
      youre newly sober and married and 
      I shouldn't be thinking about you 
      like that. But yeah, I should put 
      that out on the table. 
        (beat) 
      Honesty.

             KATE
      It's okay. I think youre a really 
      good guy.

             MR. DAVIES
      Oh, great -- good guys are the 
      nerds that carry the pretty girls 
      books.

             KATE
      Oh, cmon...

             MR. DAVIES
      I think youre beautiful.

Kate smiles bashfully.

             MR. DAVIES 
      And smart, and sexy, and cool...

Mr. Davies moves slightly closer to Kate.

             MR. DAVIES 
      And I know it's wrong, but -- in 
      meetings I stare at your lips and 
      your legs and all I can think about 
      is fucking your moist pussy.


Kate jumps back, aghast.

             MR. DAVIES 
        (off Kates horrified 
         expression) 
      Oh, crap! I dont know why I just 
      said that. Im really, really 
      sorry.

             KATE
      WHAT THE FUCK?

             MR. DAVIES
        (genuinely sorry)
      Oh, that was a bad thing to say, 
      right?

             KATE
      YES.

             MR. DAVIES
      I'm so, so sorry. Im just 
      confused, and I dont know how to 
      talk to women --

             KATE
      Jesus -- you can't just go around 
      telling people you want to fuck 
      their "moist pussy. 
        (beat) 
      Who even says that? 

             MR. DAVIES
      I'm really sorry.

Kate gets out of the car, slams the door shut, then leans in 
to say -- 

             KATE
      I have to go inside my house -- 
      where I live with my husband. 
        (beat) 
      Thanks for your creepy version of 
      honesty.

INT. KATE & CHARLIES HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Kate lies in bed and appears slightly bored as --

-- Charlie is under the covers, going down on Kate.

             KATE
      You okay?

             CHARLIE
        (from under the covers)
      Yep -- I'm just pacing myself. The 
      tortoise wins the race.

             KATE
      Actually, Im not really in the 
      mood.

             CHARLIE
      But I wanted to give you a 90 days 
      gift. 

             KATE
      Its okay -- the 90 days was the 
      gift.

             CHARLIE
      Sorry if I was doing a bad job -- 
      Im kinda hammered.

             KATE
      It's alright. Charlie...
        (long beat)
      ...I miss you.

             CHARLIE
      Huh?

Charlie comes up from under the covers -- and looks a bit 
tipsy.

             KATE
      I mean...I don't know. I don't 
      really feel connected to you 
      anymore.

             CHARLIE
      Did I do something? 

             KATE
      No. 
        (beat) 
      We don't talk that much.

             CHARLIE
      We used to talk, but now you come 
      home and go to meetings and by the 
      time you get back I'm --

             KATE
      Kinda drunk.

             CHARLIE
      I was gonna say tired.

Silence.

             KATE
      Theres some stuff I need to do 
      this weekend. I think Im gonna go 
      up to Lake Arrowhead.

             CHARLIE
      Really? To see your mom?

Kate nods. 

             CHARLIE 
      Why?

             KATE
        (defensive)
      Do I need a reason?

             CHARLIE
      With your mom? Kinda.
        (beat)
      Is this the amends step?

             KATE
      No.

             CHARLIE
      Well then whyre you going?

             KATE
        (beat)
      We send her checks. But we never 
      actually see her. Sometimes it 
      feels like Im paying her to not be 
      in my life. I thought it would be 
      nice to visit her. 
        (beat)
And Jenny thinks it would be a good 
      idea.

Charlie LAUGHS.

             KATE 
      What?

             CHARLIE
      I dont know...I mean, do you do 
      everything your sponsor tells you 
      to do?


             KATE
      No. Do you think Im brainwashed or 
      something?

             CHARLIE
      I dunno...its been a long damn 
      time since youve seen your mom. 
        (beat) 
      And you didnt listen when I 
      suggested we visit her.

             KATE
        (suddenly gets that its 
         an ego thing for Charlie)
      Oh, baby -- I listen to you. This 
      just...it felt like the right time. 
        (beat) 
      With all the changes Im going 
      through.

             CHARLIE
      Well, can I come with you? Itll be 
      like a little vacation.

             KATE
      Um...I think I should go alone.

             CHARLIE
      Come on, if you do that youll just 
      get depressed. If I go we can try 
      to make it fun. Go hiking and 
      stuff.

             KATE
      Well, if you go, dont take this 
      the wrong way but -- Id like it if 
      maybe you didnt drink. 
        (beat)
      Just while were there.

             CHARLIE
        (smiles)
      I think I can handle not drinking 
      for like a day.

Kate smiles and snuggles up into Charlies arms.

INT. SUBARU (MOVING) - DAY

Kate and Charlie drive and listen to MUSIC.


INT./EXT. SUBARU - LAKE ARROWHEAD - RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY

Kate and Charlie are parked in front of a --

-- HOUSE. Small. A little run-down. Sort of a vague ski cabin 
look. Theres some dirty lawn furniture in the front yard as 
well as a DOZEN LAWN-GNOMES.

             CHARLIE
      Ah...the lawn-gnomes. I missed 
      those guys.

Kate playfully punches Charlie in the shoulder.

             CHARLIE 
        (waving to a lawn-gnome)
      Hi, Holger!

Kate LAUGHS. Long beat.

             CHARLIE 
      So...we gonna go in? 

Charlie glances at Kate and reads the anxiety on her face.

EXT. KATES MOTHERS HOME - DAY


Kate and Charlie walk to the front door.

             KATE
        (unsettled)
      I shouldve brought something.

             CHARLIE
      Youre fine.

             KATE
      Something, you know? Flowers, or...

             CHARLIE
      Wine?

             KATE
      No. Definitely not that.

They get to the door. Charlie looks at Kate -- who seems like 
shed be okay if they ran back to the car. 


             KATE 
        (conceding)
      Go on...

Charlie KNOCKS.

             FEMALE VOICE 

      Sminute!

             KATE
        (under her breath)
      Oh, God...

The door opens, revealing --

-- ROCHELLE: late-50s, wears an old shredded heavy metal 
band T-shirt and tight ripped-up jeans, looks like she enjoys 
an afternoon drink or three. 

             ROCHELLE
        (surprised)
      Katie!

Rochelle wraps her arms around Kate.

             ROCHELLE 
      Whatre you doing here?

             KATE
      I left you a message, mom.

             ROCHELLE
      Oh, you know I dont check that 
      thing. 
        (notices Charlie; slightly 
         flirty) 
      Hello there, young man.

             CHARLIE
      Hi, Ms. Foster.

             ROCHELLE
      Well, then...
        (beat)
      ...what a lovely surprise -- you 
      two came to visit. Hell has frozen 
      over. 
        (laughs) 
      Just kidding. Come inside -- let me 
      fix you both some drinks. 

             KATE
      Just water for me.


Rochelle LAUGHS as she leads the way. Kate glances at Charlie 
-- she already seems slightly annoyed.


INT. KATES MOTHERS HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Kate and Charlie sit down. 

The place is a MESS. Magazines and junkmail everywhere. Too 
much furniture thrown together in a chaotic manner. The walls 
are covered with framed HEAVY METAL BAND POSTERS -- and there 
are ASHTRAYS everywhere, filled to the brim with cigarette 
butts.

             ROCHELLE 
      ...you wouldnt believe how much 
      the neighborhoods changed! After 
      Mr. Baker passed away and the kids 
      put Mrs. Baker in a home, the 
      people that moved in, oof!

Rochelle walks in holding a tray with THREE GIN AND TONICS.

             ROCHELLE 
      Its like they dont even 
      understand the concept of birth 
      control in their country!

Rochelle hands Charlie a glass and then goes to Kate and puts 
a drink on the table in front of her.

             ROCHELLE 
        (confides)
      If you ask me, I think its a meth 
      house. 
        (beat) 
      Theyve always got those little 
      five year old twins playing in 
      the yard, but Im pretty sure 
      theyre the lookouts. 

             KATE
      Thats pretty wild, mom.

             ROCHELLE
      Right? 
        (notices that Kate hasnt 
         touched her drink) 
      Whats wrong, honey? Think I forgot 
      how to mix em?

             KATE
      I told you I just wanted water.


             ROCHELLE
      Oh, please! Where Im from, no 
      means yes. 
        (to Charlie) 
      Am I right or am I right?

             CHARLIE
        (forcing it)
      Huh-huh...

             KATE
      Thats actually why I wanted to 
      come up, mom. 
        (beat) 
      I stopped drinking.

Rochelle LAUGHS -- then realizes Kate and Charlie arent 
joking.

             ROCHELLE
        (quickly serious)
      Are you telling me Im going to be 
      a grandma?

Rochelle tears up with joy.

Beat.

             ROCHELLE 
      Oh -- thats so exciting! Im gonna 
      be a grandma!
        (to Charlie)
      And you know that no drinking when 
      youre pregnant thing is just a 
      myth. I drank plenty when I was 
      pregnant with Kate -- and look how 
      she turned out!

             KATE
      Im not pregnant, mom. 

             ROCHELLE
      Oh.

             KATE
      I just needed a break. Im sober 
      for the first time in years.

             ROCHELLE
      Well...
        (dismissive)
      ...well see how long that lasts.


             KATE
      Its been a while, actually.

             CHARLIE
        (chimes in)
      90 days.

             ROCHELLE
        (to Kate)
      Youve sure picked the right 
      partner -- 
        (gestures to Charlie) 
      -- for this little mission.

             CHARLIE
        (defensive)
      Hey -- Im not drinking 
      either...today.

             KATE
        (to Charlie; slightly 
         annoyed)
      Drink if you want to, Charlie. 
        (to Rochelle)
      Charlie didnt stop drinking. Im 
      doing it by myself. 
        (beat)
      And...I started going to 12-step 
      meetings.

Rochelle looks slightly disgusted.

             ROCHELLE
      Ah...yes. Assholes Anonymous. 
        (to Charlie) 
      Katies father went to those 
      meetings a few years after we got 
      married. Dried up. Left me. You can 
      see how well that worked out for 
      me...
        (Rochelle gestures to her 
         living room)
      ...I raised his daughter in this 
      PALACE while hes somewhere in 
      Florida with his shiny new wife and 
      kids.
        (beat) 
      Bastard. 
        (long beat; to Charlie) 
      You better be careful -- they 
      change.

Kate and Charlie exchange a glance.

             KATE
      I thought youd be happy for me, 
      mom.

             ROCHELLE
      Oh...Im sorry -- Im not being a 
      good hostess, am I?

Rochelle gets up, takes the drink away from Kate, and chugs 
it.

             ROCHELLE 
      Ill microwave you your favorite.

A FEW MOMENTS LATER

Charlie, Kate, and Rochelle watch a REALITY TV SHOW -- while 
eating...

...MCDONALDS CHEESEBURGERS.

Rochelle rests her head on Kates shoulder.

             ROCHELLE 
      Im sorry if I acted like a bitch.

             KATE
      Its okay, mom. I know you cant 
      help it.

EXT. LAKE ARROWHEAD - SANTAS VILLAGE - DAY

Kate and Charlie wander around Santas Village -- 

-- an abandoned Christmas-themed amusement park (with giant 
ginger bread houses, plastic Christmas trees, etc.) in the 
middle of the woods. Creepy and nostalgic at the same time. 
Looks like the set of a Christmas horror film.

Kate holds Charlies hand as she leads him around.

             KATE
      This place shut down a decade ago 
      and then there was a fire and now 
      its basically abandoned.

Charlie seems totally impressed by the weirdness of the 
place.

             KATE 
      We came here every year the week 
      before Christmas. 

             KATE 
      And then I worked here in high 
      school -- selling hot chocolate. 
      And they had real reindeer, too. 
      They kept em over there.

Kate points at the remains of a PEN. 

             KATE 
      My mom worked here when she was 
      younger. I think everyone who grew 
      up around here worked at Santas 
      Village at some point.

Charlie just nods and listens -- hes in awe of this place.

             KATE 
      This is what I think of when I 
      think of Christmas. 
        (long beat) 
      Thanks for coming up here with me.

             CHARLIE
      Of course.

             KATE
      Im sorry my moms so awful.

             CHARLIE
        (shrugs)
      She just cant handle her liquor.

Kate and Charlie look in each others eyes. Seem to have a 
moment. And then Charlie asks --

             CHARLIE 
      Did you ever hook up with guys when 
      you worked here?

             KATE
      Huh?

             CHARLIE
      You know -- sneak off with a co-
      worker and do it against a pine 
      tree or something?

             KATE
      Um...no.


             CHARLIE
      I mean, if I were a teenage boy 
      working with a stone cold fox like 
      you Id totally want to hook up 
      with you here. Like...in the ginger 
      bread house.

Charlie puts his arms around Kate.

             CHARLIE 
      You were probably the coolest girl 
      in town -- and the prettiest. Im 
      sure everyone was in love with you.

Kate giggles. They kiss. Its sweet.

INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY

Kate walks in to her class to find --

             TEACHERS
      SURPRISE!

-- a GROUP OF TEACHERS -- including Principal Barnes and Mr. 
Davies -- standing in the room, which has been decked out for 
a --

-- BABY SHOWER.  

             PRINCIPAL BARNES
      I couldnt keep quiet. Sorry. I 
      just had to tell everyone so we 
      could celebrate.

             KATE
        (shock)
      Oh...you shouldnt have.

             PRINCIPAL BARNES
      You dont have to thank me -- just 
      open your presents!

Kate looks at her desk which is stacked with PRESENTS wrapped 
in pink and baby blue wrapping paper. Theres also a CAKE.

             KATE
      Wow...

             PRINCIPAL BARNES
      Go ahead.



             OTHER TEACHERS
      Cmon, Kate! Youre gonna love 
      what I got you! Is it a boy or a 
      girl?

LATER

Kate opens a present -- a MOBILE.

             KATE
        (seems nauseous)
      Oh, its so...nice.

             PRINCIPAL BARNES
        (enthusiastic)
      Its to hang over the crib!

             KATE
      Uh-huh...

MONTAGE: Kate opens presents while the teachers CLAP. 

Eventually, Kate begins to CRY -- which everyone assumes are 
tears of joy. 

Principal Barnes takes a bite of cake.

             PRINCIPAL BARNES
      Mmmm...its so moist.

Kate glances at Mr. Davies, who cringes.

EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY


Kate walks to her car.

             MR. DAVIES 
      Kate!

Kate looks back to see Mr. Davies running over -- but she 
doesnt reply or slow down.

             MR. DAVIES 
      Kate?

             KATE
        (stops)
      What?

             MR. DAVIES
      Listen -- I am so, so sorry. You 
      have no idea how much this has been 
      eating me up.

Long beat.

             KATE
      What you said to me was really 
      fucked up.

             MR. DAVIES
      I know.

             KATE
      What were you even thinking?

             MR. DAVIES
      I wasnt -- I was just...I try to 
      be really honest.

             KATE
      I get that. But you cant force 
      your honesty on everyone you 
      know. 

Mr. Davies nods. He looks really embarrassed.

             KATE 
        (changing tone)
      Im flattered that you 
      have...feelings for me. I am. But 
      Im married.

             MR. DAVIES
      I know. Im sorry. Ill apologize 
      to your husband if you want.

             KATE
      No -- you dont have to do that. I 
      didnt even tell him. But...you 
      cant say that to a girl -- like, 
      ever.

             MR. DAVIES
      Okay.

             KATE
      Seriously. Consider that a rule of 
      thumb. 
        (beat) 
      Someday, youre gonna meet a nice, 
      available lady -- but if you say 
      moist pussy to her, you will 
      never, ever, ever get to see that 
      part of her body!


             MR. DAVIES
        (even more embarrassed)
      Okay. 
        (beat) 
      Thank you.  
        (nods)
      I feel like this was a really good 
      talk.

Kate forces a smile.


INT. KATE & CHARLIES HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT 


Kate stares at a --

-- HALF-EATEN BIRTHDAY CAKE (OWEN is still sort of legible) 
on the kitchen table. Its totally mutilated.

She walks out the back door into the

BACKYARD

where she finds

Charlie, Owen, and one of Owens friends --

-- GREG, 21 --

-- listening to loud MUSIC while they play FOOSBALL.

Theyre all SHIT-HOUSED.

             GREG
      ...getting married would fucking 
      suck. I cant even imagine waking 
      up to the same person for the rest 
      of my life.

Kate walks out.

	    GREG 
	Whats up, Kate?

	OWEN
	Hey, Kate.


             KATE
      I see you guys found the birthday 
      cake Jenny and I baked.

             OWEN
      Yeah, thanks! You should get a 
      slice. 

             KATE 
        (to Charlie)
      I, uh...kinda thought wed all eat 
      it together.

             CHARLIE
      Baby -- I didnt even think about 
      that. Im sorry. 

             OWEN
      It was really good. 

             GREG
      We have plenty of tequila to make 
      up for the cake.

             OWEN
      Kates in AA -- so she cant drink. 
      She hasnt drank in forever -- like 
      thirty-eight days or some shit.

             KATE
      Ninety-five days, actually.

             GREG
      That sucks! Do you still smoke 
      weed?

             KATE
      No, I wasnt a big weed smoker 
      anyway.

             OWEN
      You smoked crack though, didnt 
      you?

Kates face goes blank. She stares at Charlie.

             GREG
      Shit -- I hear crack gets you so 
      high!

             CHARLIE
      No -- my wife doesnt smoke crack. 
      Jesus...

             OWEN
      What? Im joking around. I know 
      Kates not a crackhead or some 
      shit. 
        (to Kate)
      It was just that one time, right?

             KATE
        (angry; to Charlie)
      Thanks, Charlie.

Kate storms out of the room.

             CHARLIE
        (to Owen)
      Its your birthday, man, so Im not 
      gonna make a big deal out of this -- 
      but you need to shut the fuck up 
      sometimes.

INT. KATE & CHARLIES HOUSE - BEDROOM/BATHROOM - NIGHT - 
MOMENTS LATER

Charlie walks in to see Kate getting ready to go to bed.

             CHARLIE
      Listen -- Im sorry. Hes 
      drunk...really drunk.

             KATE
      Im not mad at him -- Im mad at 
      you! You said you wouldnt tell 
      anyone about what I did.

             CHARLIE
      Im...sorry. I...was drunk too when 
      I told him.

             KATE
      Great. 
        (beat)
      Why dont you guys just go to the 
      bar now?

             CHARLIE
      You wanna come? 

             KATE
      Im hanging here.

             CHARLIE
      Im sure they have near-beer, baby. 
      Itll be fun.

             KATE
      Im staying in. 

             CHARLIE
      That sounds like a lot of fun.

             KATE
      Bye.

Beat.

             CHARLIE
      I love you.

Kate doesnt say a word.

             CHARLIE 
      I love you...?

             KATE
      Yeah... 
        (long beat)
      ...I love you too.


INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - MORNING


Kate stands at the BLACKBOARD -- teaching addition and 
subtraction to the class.

A little girl -- ISABEL -- raises her hand.

             KATE
      Yes?

             ISABEL
      Mrs. Hannah -- shouldnt you be 
      more fatter?

             KATE
      What?

             ISABEL
      Cause of the baby. My mom got real 
      fat.

             KATE
        (taken off-guard)
      Well...Shouldnt you be fatter? 
      is the correct way to ask that 
      question.

Kate goes back to the board -- clearly wanting to move on.

             KATE 
      Now, one day when youre very old 
      and wise fourth graders, youll 
      learn about multiplication and --

             ISABEL
      Mrs. Hannah -- Shouldnt you be 
      more fat?

All the students look at Kate. Shes on the spot. Flustered.

             KATE
      Well, I...

Kate searches for something to say. Anything. But then she 
blurts --

             KATE 
      ...Im not going to have a baby.

             CLASS
      OOOH!

Kate immediately looks like she wishes she could take it 
back.

             KATE
      See -- I was pregnant but, it 
      wasnt my time, I suppose...

Another little girl -- WINNIE -- jumps in.

             WINNIE
      Mrs. Hannah -- did you kill the 
      baby?

             KATE
      WHAT? No -- of course not!

             WINNIE
      Cause my mom says that when you 
      kill a baby you go to hell and you 
      cant even go to church to ask god 
      for forgiveness.

The students begin to WHISPER to each other.

Another boy -- TOBY -- asks --

             TOBY
      Mrs. Hannah -- are you going to 
      hell?

             KATE
      No! I didnt kill my baby! Okay, 
      listen kids -- we shouldnt be 
      talking about this. But...
        (beat) 
      ...sometimes women get pregnant and 
      then early on -- before its even a 
      baby -- they stop being pregnant.

             WINNIE
      Because a doctor murders it!

             KATE
      No -- not because a doctor murdered 
      it. 
        (beat) 
      Its called a miscarriage. That 
      means it wasnt my plan -- its 
      just what happened. 
        (composes herself)
      Does anyone want to ask me any 
      questions?

The class nods but seems silently freaked out.

             KATE 
      Lets get back to subtraction -- or 
      addition. Or both. 

INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - TEACHERS LOUNGE - DAY


Kate sits with Mr. Davies eating lunch.

Kate nods.

             MR. DAVIES
      Well, that was bound to happen at 
      some point. Kids notice things like 
      that. 

             MR. DAVIES 
      But I had no idea how pro-life 
      little Winnie Reddy is. 
        (beat) 
      Remind me to wear my May the fetus 
      you save be gay T-shirt to the 
      next banana split night.

Kate half-laughs.


             MR. DAVIES 
      And just think: the kids got a 
      lesson about life and death that 
      nobody planned on. I mean, youre 
      years ahead of the standard 
      curriculum for, uh, third graders.

             KATE
      Does it matter that I lied? That I 
      was never pregnant?

             MR. DAVIES
      You want me to answer that as a 
      friend or as someone who takes the 
      twelve steps very seriously?

Kate shrugs.

             MR. DAVIES 
      Well, the good thing is that its 
      all over now. Principal Barnes will 
      think youre a martyr for losing a 
      baby. 
        (beat) 
      The kids wont ask about it anymore 
      and as long as you dont toss your 
      cookies again you wont have to 
      deal with it.

             KATE
        (long beat)
      And the bad news?

             MR. DAVIES
      You lied. To your boss -- and a 
      bunch of small children. Who trust 
      you. And rely on you to help them 
      differentiate right from wrong.

             KATE
        (slowly nods)
      Thats all, huh?

INT. KATE & CHARLIES HOUSE - LIVING ROOM/DINING 
ROOM/KITCHEN/BEDROOM - NIGHT


Kate and Charlie eat TAKE-OUT FOOD in SILENCE. Kate texts on 
her CELL PHONE -- not even paying attention to Charlie.

             CHARLIE
      Well...
        (beat)                                            

             CHARLIE 
      ...I gotta say -- this is the 
      boringest meal Ive had in about as 
      long as I can remember.

Kate doesnt look up.

             CHARLIE 
      Whore you texting?

             KATE
        (still looking down)
	Jenny.

             CHARLIE
      Shes like a parole officer.

             KATE
      Shes my sponsor. 

             CHARLIE
      Im glad to know every little fuck-
      up I have is gonna become a topic 
      of conversation with some chick I 
      dont even know.

Kate finishes her text. Puts down her phone.

             KATE
        (fake enthusiasm)
      So...whatd you do today, honey?

             CHARLIE
      I finished some writing and met up 
      with Owen to watch the game and 
      toss a few back. Dear. 
        (beat) 
      You do anything special?

             KATE
      I lied to my class again. I told 
      them that I had a miscarriage.

Charlie LAUGHS.

             KATE 
      Thats not funny.

             CHARLIE
      Yeah, it is. Telling kids fucked-up 
      stuff is totally funny...in, you 
      know -- a kinda fucked-up way.


             KATE
      Great, well -- Im glad Im not 
      actually having a baby. 

             CHARLIE
      God, Kate -- come on. What else 
      were you supposed to do? 

             KATE
      Well, I feel like a piece of shit 
      for lying.

             CHARLIE
      Its not that big a deal. Jesus. Is 
      this what those meetings teach you? 
      To make drama out of nothing?

             KATE
      Its not nothing. I lied to little 
      kids and to my boss because I cant 
      take responsibility for my actions.

             CHARLIE
      Why dont you go and tell the 
      Principal that you were never 
      pregnant? That the reason you puked 
      is because you smoked crack all 
      night? Would you feel better about 
      yourself then?

             KATE
      Ive been thinking about doing 
      that, actually. 
        (thinks about it) 
      Yeah. I think I would feel better 
      about myself.

             CHARLIE
      Fine. Do it, then. I guess you 
      dont need a job.

             KATE
      I could be like you -- I could stay 
      home drinking all day and never do 
      anything responsible.

             CHARLIE
        (hurt)
      I never do anything responsible? 
      What about buying this house that 
      we live in? Or the food that were 
      eating?

Beat.


             KATE
      Having rich parents doesnt make 
      you responsible. I think its 
      pretty much done the opposite.

Charlie looks stunned.


             CHARLIE
      Oh, Im sorry that I have a family 
      that supports us -- and not the 
      other way around.

             KATE
      What the fuck is that supposed to 
      mean?

             CHARLIE
      Nothing, Kate. But you cant be mad 
      at me because my family has helped 
      us out. You should be grateful we 
      dont have to struggle.

             KATE
      I wouldnt care if we struggled 
      with money. Ive struggled with 
      money my whole life. 
        (beat) 
      Id rather worry about where my 
      next meal is coming from than if I -
      - in some drunken stupor -- married 
      a man who just wants to party and 
      meet bands. 

             CHARLIE
      What the fuck are you talking 
      about?

             KATE
      Im talking about you being a baby. 
      A selfish baby.

             CHARLIE
      You know what?

             KATE
      What?

             CHARLIE
      I fucking hate AA! It turned you 
      into a bitch. A brain-washed bitch.

             KATE
      At least Im not drunk all the 
      time.

             CHARLIE
      Yeah, you dont drink booze for 
      three months and suddenly youre 
      some saint? You have it all 
      together and Im just a baby? 

Kate doesnt answer.

             CHARLIE 
      Im trying, Kate. Im trying to 
      understand you. But its hard. 
      Youre different and maybe its 
      good that youre different. Maybe 
      Im bad and bad for you or 
      something -- because I didnt think 
      the person you were before was so 
      awful. I loved that person. Yeah, 
      she drank a lot and she did some 
      silly things...but she was my Kate. 

             KATE
      You loved that person? Do you not 
      love me now?

             CHARLIE
      Yeah, of course. But its 
      different. Youre different.

             KATE
      Before I was a mess. 
        (beat)
      Im finally getting my life 
      together -- and you loved me more 
      before?

Charlie looks at the floor.

             CHARLIE
        (soft)
      Kinda, yeah. 

Charlie looks like he immediately regrets what he said.


INT./EXT. JENNYS CATERING BUSINESS - NIGHT

Kate follows Jenny from her patio to her kitchen as she 
cleans up.

             KATE
      I feel so fucking weird right now --
      Charlie doesnt love me like he 
      used to and Ive lied to my 
      students multiple times.


             KATE 
        (beat) 
      I just dont feel...normal right 
      now. 

             JENNY
      Well, youre not normal. 
        (beat)
      None of us are.

             KATE
      Everything in life isnt connected 
      to being an alcoholic.

             JENNY
      Im not just talking about 
      alcoholics. 
        (beat) 
      People are fucking weird. We all 
      have a lot of shit we carry around 
      in our heads that doesnt make 
      sense. 
        (beat)
      At least alcoholics have tools to 
      work through it.

             KATE
      Steps...

             JENNY
      Yeah, steps -- and talking and 
      listening and crying...

             KATE
      I have the crying part covered.

             JENNY
      I know, right? I think my first 
      year I cried tears Id been saving 
      since I was eight. 
        (beat)
      Its hard to live your 
      life...honestly. You know?

Kate nods.

             JENNY 
      Any idea what youre gonna do about 
      your school situation? What youre 
      gonna say?

Kate shakes her head.

             KATE
      I dont know what Im gonna do 
      about anything.

	JENNY
	Listen...you wanna stay in my guest 
      room tonight? You can watch movies, 
      get some good sleep...?

             KATE
      You sure thats okay?

	JENNY
      Yeah, of course. Thats why I spent 
      money on a guest bed -- so people 
      could sleep in it. 
        (beat) 
      I know it might feel like it, but 
      really, you dont have to figure 
      everything out tonight. 
        (smiles)
      Youve got time.

INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY

Kate goes into her classroom and finds a NOTE on the desk.


INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - PRINCIPALS OFFICE - DAY

Principal Barnes hugs Kate.

             PRINCIPAL BARNES
      Im so sorry, Kate. 
        (beat) 
      I havent told many people this, 
      but when I was young -- younger 
      than you...I lost a child too.

Kates stunned. Looks like she feels terrible.

             KATE
      Im...Im really sorry.

             PRINCIPAL BARNES
      Its okay. It was a long, long time 
      ago. Still hurts sometimes. But 
      eventually...you move on. You have 
      to.
        (beat) 
      Have a seat.

Kate sits down.



             PRINCIPAL BARNES 
      I got a phone call from a very 
      upset parent. Thats how I found 
      out about...you know. Frankly, Im 
      not sure why you didnt feel like 
      you could tell me.  

             KATE
      I freaked out -- a student asked 
      why I wasnt fat and I just froze 
      up and then another student was 
      saying I killed my baby and I 
      didnt know what to do.

             PRINCIPAL BARNES
      Im not angry with you -- but I 
      need to be clear that this doesnt 
      happen again.

             KATE
      It wont. I promise that.

             PRINCIPAL BARNES
      By not happening again, I mean 
      that you dont discuss any 
      controversial topics -- things the 
      school board deems family matters 
      with your class. 
        (beat)
      No sex. No god. No drugs and 
      alcohol.

             KATE
      Okay, I...

Kate straightens up in her seat, takes a deep breath. She 
seems...exhausted.

             KATE 
      ...I cant keep doing this. I feel 
      awful. 

             PRINCIPAL BARNES
        (confused)
      I know this all must be hard for 
      you --

             KATE
      No. You dont understand. 
        (beat) 
      I have to be honest with you. 

             PRINCIPAL BARNES
      What do you mean?


             KATE
      Principal Barnes...I wasnt ever 
      pregnant.

Principal Barnes looks shocked.


             KATE 
      I lied -- to the class and to you --
      because I was scared.

             PRINCIPAL BARNES
      But...you vomited in class.

             KATE
      I know. And when that happened I 
      didnt know what to do because the 
      truth is --

             PRINCIPAL BARNES
      Oh, my god -- are you really ill? 
      Is it cancer?

             KATE
      No, well, yes. I have a disease, 
      but, um...
        (beat)
      ...its alcoholism.

Principal Barnes goes from concerned -- to angry.

             PRINCIPAL BARNES
      What?

             KATE
      Ive been working on it. Im one-
      hundred days sober. When that 
      happened Id been out drinking and 
      was hung over and --

             PRINCIPAL BARNES
      You vomited in front of children 
      because you were hung over?

             KATE
      Yes.

             PRINCIPAL BARNES
      And lied, saying that you were 
      pregnant?

             KATE
      Well, a student asked if I was 
      pregnant -- and yes just kind of 
      fell out of my mouth.


Principal Barnes looks disgusted.


             PRINCIPAL BARNES
      Thats sick, Kate.

             KATE
      I know.

             PRINCIPAL BARNES
      No, I dont think you understand 
      how wrong that is. To lie to me -- 
      to the children. You know I felt so 
      terrible for you when I found out 
      that you had a mis -- ?
        (beat)
      -- how can you play with peoples 
      emotions like that?

             KATE
      I was sick. 

             PRINCIPAL BARNES
      Jesus...you told us you had a 
      miscarriage.

             KATE
      Im sorry. 

             PRINCIPAL BARNES
      I threw you a baby shower.

             KATE
      Im really sorry. I am. Ive been 
      wanting to tell you the truth 
      because honesty has become really 
      important to me. Im in AA now and 
      doing the steps and working with a 
      sponsor and everything. 
        (beat) 
      Its really hard. I mean, I think 
      my husband might hate me, and  --

             PRINCIPAL BARNES
      Im sorry, but what you did is 
      totally irresponsible. 

             KATE
      I know.

             PRINCIPAL BARNES
        (beat)
      I cant have you here anymore.

             KATE
        (surprised)
      Am I being fired?

             PRINCIPAL BARNES
      No, no -- the state wouldnt allow 
      that without a report. Im not 
      going to write a report. Because, 
      frankly, I have no idea what that 
      report would say. 
        (beat) 
      But Im forcing you to take a leave 
      of absence and I think its in your 
      best interest if you find a job 
      elsewhere.

             KATE
      Listen -- Im really sorry, but Im 
      doing the right things now.

             PRINCIPAL BARNES
      I believe you -- or I want to. I 
      really do. But honey -- I believed 
      you before. 
        (beat) 
      Ill have a sub take over your 
      class starting tomorrow. Its late 
      enough in the year that we can just 
      say youre having personal problems 
      -- 

Principal Barnes looks at Kate.

             PRINCIPAL BARNES 
      -- which seems to be the truth.

             KATE
      Principal Barnes --

             PRINCIPAL BARNES
      Not another word. Im upset right 
      now -- very upset -- and I think 
      Im doing you a favor by not 
      reporting you. 

Kate struggles to say something, to try to explain herself 
but no words come out until she musters --

             KATE
      Thank you.

Kate stands, defeated, and leaves the Principal's office.


INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - STAIRS/HALLWAY - DAY

Kate glumly marches down the stairs -- holding a BOX filled 
with some of her things (including the BABY SHOWER GIFTS).

Mr. Davies stops her.

             MR. DAVIES
      Kate -- whats going on?

             KATE
      I told Principal Barnes about 
      everything.

             MR. DAVIES
        (terrified)
      What? Everything? Did you tell her 
      about...?

Mr. Davies gestures to Kates crotch.

             KATE
        (confused)
      Huh? 
        (gets it)
      Oh, God -- no. I told her that Im 
      an alcoholic. And that I lied. And 
      she fired me.

             MR. DAVIES
        (relieved)
      Oh...
        (but concerned, too)
      ...my god, Kate -- Im sorry.

             KATE
      Ive been going to AA and trying to 
      be sober and this is what it got 
      me. 
        (beat)
      Fired, for telling the truth.

Mr. Davies awkwardly puts his arm around Kates shoulder.

             MR. DAVIES
      Im sorry. I wish there was 
      something I could do.

             KATE
      Im a fuck-up. Ill always be a 
      fuck up. Im just like my mom.


             MR. DAVIES
        (confused)
      No, no -- youre a wonderful, smart 
      woman Kate. You cant let this get 
      you down.

             KATE
      I gotta go. 

Mr. Davies takes Kates box of things from her.

             MR. DAVIES
      Let me walk you to your car.

Kate throws her arms around Mr. Davies and begins to --

-- full-on SOB.

Mr. Davies seems flustered and a little scared but tries to 
comfort Kate.


INT. SUBARU (MOVING) - DAY

Kate cries as she drives.

She glances in the backseat at --

-- all the baby shower gifts --

-- and sobs even harder.

INT. DIVE BAR - DAY

Kate walks into a near-empty, depressing dive. She nervously 
sits at the bar.

The BARTENDER -- a gruff looking guy with the sleeves rolled 
up -- approaches.

             BARTENDER
      What do you need?

             KATE
      Whiskey. Double.

The bartender gives Kate her drink. Kate immediately downs 
it.

             KATE 
      Can I have another one?


             BARTENDER
      Sure -- you gotta pay for the first 
      one, though. Eight bucks.

Kate puts a TWENTY DOLLAR BILL down.

The bartender pours her another shot.

LATER

Kate has clearly been drinking for awhile -- shes curled up 
at the bar, nursing her BEER.

             BARTENDER 
      Look, Miss -- I dont wanna be a 
      downer or anything cause I take it 
      youve had a bad day, but um... I 
      think you need to go home.

             KATE
      Why?

             BARTENDER
      Cause youre pretty drunk -- and 
      its four p.m.

             KATE
      What about him?

Kate points to an old CRUSTY MAN at the other end of the bar.

             KATE 
      Youre not kicking him out.

             BARTENDER
      Im just trying to be a pal.

             KATE
      Stop it -- you arent my pal. I 
      just got fired, and I just quit AA. 
        (beat)
      It didnt work.

             BARTENDER
      Oh, boy...

             KATE
      You know what? I was fine -- had a 
      husband that loved me and maybe I 
      sometimes did embarrassing stuff, 
      but it was a phase. 


             KATE 
      I go to AA and sober my husband and 
      I start fighting and stop fucking -- 
      and sober I get fired! Isnt that 
      whats supposed to not happen?

             BARTENDER
      Wow, okay, well...Im real sorry. 
      But this place gets a little nuts 
      after sundown and I dont think a 
      pretty girl who just left AA should 
      be here. 
        (beat)
      Im gonna call you a cab.

             KATE
      NO! I dont want a cab. I want -- 
        (glances around) 
      -- drugs. Can you hook me up?

The bartender rolls his eyes.

             KATE 
      Cmon...lets go out back and smoke 
      some crack.

             BARTENDER
      Lady, youre done.

             KATE
      You think Im above smoking crack? 
      Cause Im not. And are you really 
      gonna tell me youre not a little 
      attracted to me...?

Kate leans across the bar, trying to look seductive -- but 
she just looks like she might fall off her bar stool.

             BARTENDER
      No.

             KATE
      Just a teensy bit...?

             BARTENDER
      Not in the slightest.

             KATE
      Well...you might want to consider 
      investing in glasses, buddy. Cause 
      Im a...a stone cold fox. And Im 
      smart. And Im...

Kate begins to cry.


             KATE 
      ...a good person.

             BARTENDER
      I think its time for you to go 
      home. Now are you gonna let me call 
      a cab?

             KATE
        (suddenly angry)
      NO! Im not. Ive got friends. 
      Theyll pick me up. 

             BARTENDER
      You do that.

             KATE
      Ill call Mr. Davies. He has dreams 
      about me.

The bartender takes a long look at Kate -- as though hes 
trying to size up if shes insane.

             BARTENDER
      Hope that works out for you.

             KATE
      Cant believe my luck. I just want 
      to get drunk and a bartender wont 
      let me.
        (beat)
      Life is stupid.

Kate stands up -- almost falling over -- and glares at the 
bartender.

             KATE 
      You hear me? Life is FUCKING 
      STUPID!

Kate goes over to the old man at the end of bar, winks at 
him, then picks up his drink and chugs it.


INT. MR. DAVIES CAR (MOVING) - DAY

Kate is slumped in the back seat. 

In the front seat is Mr. Davies and Jenny.


             KATE
      Davey-wavey...I called you. Whyd 
      you bring her?


             JENNY
      Were worried about you, Kate.

             KATE
        (accusing)
      Parole officer.

             MR. DAVIES
      Shes your sponsor.

             JENNY
      Its gonna be okay. You stumbled. 
      Youll get back up.

Silence.

             KATE
      How bout we drive to Mexico and 
      party our asses off? My treat.

Jenny and Dave glance back at Kate --

-- whose face reveals what a bad state shes in.

             KATE 
        (holding back tears)
      Sounds fucking stupendous, right?

EXT. KATE & CHARLIES HOUSE - DAY

Kate gets out of the car.

Mr. Davies and Jenny watch with concerned expressions as --

-- Kate stumbles to her front door.

             JENNY
      Kate! Are you sure youre --

             KATE
        (over her shoulder)
      Fuck off.

INT. KATE & CHARLIES HOUSE - LIVING 
ROOM/KITCHEN/HALLWAY/BEDROOM - DAY


Charlie plays a VIDEO GAME -- with the TV hooked up through 
his STEREO SPEAKERS.

Kate opens the doors and walks in, wobbly. 


             CHARLIE
        (not looking up)
      Babe -- you gotta hear this with 
      the speakers hooked up. Its 
      insane.

Kate says nothing. Just stares at Charlie.

Charlie looks up -- and is surprised to see Kate clearly 
drunk.

             CHARLIE 
      Whoa...what happened to you?

Charlie stops playing the game.

             KATE
      Im drunk. Im fired from my job.

             CHARLIE
      Oh, no...

             KATE
      We got any drinks?

             CHARLIE
      Uh...we have soda. I can make 
      coffee.

             KATE
      Dont be cute with me. You know 
      what I mean.

             CHARLIE
      So...I guess you arent doing the 
      AA thing anymore?

             KATE
      What gave that away?

Kate turns and goes to the kitchen --

-- reappearing a moment later with a BOTTLE OF TEQUILA, salt 
and limes.

             KATE 
      Come on, baby -- lets do some 
      shots.

             CHARLIE
      Whats going on?


             KATE
      Im celebrating. What the fuck does 
      it look like? 

Kate takes a shot.

             KATE 
      Are you gonna be a little girl or 
      are you gonna drink with me?

             CHARLIE
      I dont know what the right thing 
      to do here is. 

             KATE
      Okay, so let me see if this makes 
      sense: you say you miss the old 
      Kate -- the Kate who drinks and 
      blacks out and has fun. 
        (beat)
      Well...here she is.

Kate smiles -- but she looks more desperate and drunk than 
fun.

             CHARLIE
      Baby, I didnt mean that. I was 
      just being a jerk.

             KATE
      Fuck yeah you were. And what? Now 
      you wont drink with me?

             CHARLIE
      I dont know. Having a beer or 
      something is one thing, but...I 
      think you really may have a 
      problem.

Kate LAUGHS.

             KATE
      Well thanks for all the support 
      when I was trying to be sober!

Kate takes another shot.

             CHARLIE
      Im sorry. I didnt realize --

             KATE
      Of course you didnt realize! You 
      dont fucking care about me.


             CHARLIE
      What are you talking about?! Of 
      course I care about you. I love 
      you.

Kate takes a shot and approaches Charlie.

             KATE
      I love you too. Love is the easy 
      part. Its the rest of the shit 
      thats hard.

Kate kisses Charlie.

             KATE 
      Take off your pants.

Charlie gently pushes Kate away. 

             CHARLIE
      Look -- I think you should get to 
      sleep. Youre really wasted.

             KATE
      I dont wanna sleep. I wanna fuck.

Kate pulls Charlie -- who struggles -- down to the 
couch...and straddles him.

             CHARLIE
      Please, will you stop?

             KATE
      No! I want you to fuck me!

Charlie calmly tries to move Kate off of him.

             CHARLIE
      Really. This is weird.

             KATE
      Be a man and fuck your wife!

Charlie -- whos creeped out now -- forcefully pushes Kate 
off.

             CHARLIE
      No! Jesus -- what the fuck is wrong 
      with you?

Kate has become quite angry and belligerent by this point -- 
and begins picking up HOUSEHOLD OBJECTS and throwing them at 
Charlie.


             KATE
      With me? With me?! What the fuck is 
      wrong with me? I try hard and I get 
      shit on! Fucked up family, fired 
      from my job -- this marriage. 
      Nothings wrong with me! Whats 
      wrong with YOU?!

             CHARLIE
      Kate, you need to -- 

             KATE
      What? What? What do I need? I cant 
      drink because Im crazy or 
      something and I cant stay sober 
      because of you!

             CHARLIE
      Youre blaming other people for 
      your problems. 

Kate picks the tequila bottle back up, takes a sip, then --

-- runs at Charlie and tackles him to the ground.

             CHARLIE 
      Stop it! Youre acting like a 
      freak!

Kate rips Charlies SHIRT -- 

-- and holds the bottle over his head while straddling him, 
as if shes about to hit him with it.

             CHARLIE 
      No! Whats wrong with you?

Kate holds the bottle in the air and looks hard at Charlie. 
She begins to weep.

             KATE
      I cant be sober and be with you.

Kate gets a flash of anger again and just as it seems like 
shes about to hit Charlie with the bottle, she --

-- upturns the bottle and begins to chug the tequila.

Charlie tries to yank the bottle away, but Kate holds on 
tight. With the bottle at Kates lips -- and tequila pouring 
down her chin -- the couple wrestles for control of the 
bottle.

CUT TO BLACK.

FADE IN:

INT. JENNYS CATERING BUSINESS - KITCHEN - DAY


Kate wears a UNIFORM and carefully works on a CAKE. 

On the other side of the kitchen, Jenny makes APPETIZERS.

             JENNY
      Hows it coming?

             KATE
      You tell me.

Jenny walks over and tries the icing.

             JENNY
        (nods with approval)
      Delicious.

             KATE
        (proud)
      Thanks.

INT. CHURCH - AA MEETING ROOM - NIGHT


A middle-aged MAN stands at a podium in front of a medium 
sized group of PEOPLE -- about twenty-five or so, including 
Kate, Jenny, and Mr. Davies -- and says --

             CHUCK
      At this meeting we give cakes to 
      celebrate sober birthdays. We have 
      one birthday tonight -- for Kate,  
      for one year. 
        (beat)
      Jenny and Dave are giving her the 
      cake.

Kate hugs everyone -- then blows out ONE CANDLE on a CAKE 
before standing at the podium.

             KATE
      Hey, Im Kate, alcoholic.

             GROUP
      Hi, Kate.


             KATE
      Ive heard that your best day 
      drinking is worse than your worst 
      day sober. 
        (beat) 
      Well...that is SO not true! I had 
      amazing times drinking, dancing, 
      and laughing...feeling like the 
      most adorable, charming girl in the 
      world. And I was adorable. 
        (beat) 
      Id piss my pants, but I was still 
      cute.

People in the crowd LAUGH a little bit.

             KATE 
      When I first tried getting sober, I 
      figured that as long as I didnt 
      drink...everything else would just 
      magically work out. But it didnt. 
        (beat)
      My marriage fell apart. I got fired 
      from my job. And that shit happened 
      SOBER! I never read that in any 
      pamphlet...
        (shakes her head)
      ...that isnt what I signed up for. 
          (beat)
      Um...so, I relapsed. Another shitty 
      slogan Ive heard in the rooms is 
      that when youre sober for a bit 
      and drink again the disease waits 
      for you, picks up where it left 
      off. 
        (beat)
      Im sorry you guys, but I HATE 
      those slogans. They all sound like 
      bumper stickers. But, I have to 
      admit...for me, that last one is 
      pretty damn true. 
        (beat)
      When I drink...I become another 
      person. And that person is a pretty 
      big asshole. Well, unless you want 
      to give me drugs or buy me drinks --  
      then that person is awesome. 

People knowingly LAUGH.

             KATE 
      I wasnt happy being the good-time 
      girl, though. And honestly, I 
      wasnt very good at it. 

             KATE 
        (beat) 
      My life is really different than it 
      was a year ago. I live alone. Im 
      bored a lot more. I have a job that 
      pays a lot less.
        (beat)
      Im thankful for the program -- for 
      my friends in here who took the 
      time to help me and give a shit 
      about me. 

Kate glances at Jenny and Mr. Davies.


             KATE 
      There are people that used to be a 
      part of my life that I miss -- a 
      lot -- but...
        (long beat)
      ...Im really grateful for this 
      boring new life of mine. 

Kate smiles and steps down from the podium as people CLAP.

INT. BAR - NIGHT

Charlie, Owen, and a woman -- MILLIE -- stand at the bar,  
drinking BEER and WHISKEY SHOTS. Owen speaks -- but Millie 
seems way more into Charlie.


             OWEN
 I was in North Carolina for a while 
      -- Durham -- playing minor league 
      ball. I had some real heat. Thats 
      when I met Crash, here. 
        (gestures to Charlie) 
      Hed been sent down to single-A to 
      teach me how to carry myself as a 
      pro ball-player. We got involved 
      with the same woman -- an older 
      chick -- but Crash won her in the 
      end. 
        (beat)
      Hes really taught me 
      some...important life-lessons.

Millie nods.

             MILLIE
      Wow...thats a pretty crazy way to 
      meet. 

             OWEN
      Yeah. It is.

             MILLIE
      You guys are sorta like that 
      movie...whats it called?

             OWEN
        (plays dumb)
      I dont know. Which one? 
        (to Charlie) 
      Do you know what movie she means?

Charlie -- whos pretty hammered -- shakes his head.

             MILLIE
      Bull...something? What is it?

Charlie and Owen feign ignorance.

             MILLIE 
      Whatever. Itll come to me.
        (to Charlie; flirty)
      So...what do you do now, Crash?

             CHARLIE
      I write about music.

             MILLIE
      Really?

Owen gestures to a WAITRESS to bring THREE MORE SHOTS.

             CHARLIE
      Yeah...I do freelance for a lot of 
      magazines. But print really is 
      dead. So now most of my stuff winds 
      up on websites. Which is 
      depressing. Cause you cant hold 
      it -- you can just look at it. Its 
      like...

Charlie seems lost in drunken thought. Long, awkward silence. 
Millie puts her hand on Charlies arm.

  
             MILLIE
    Like what?

             CHARLIE
      Huh?


             MILLIE
      You were talking about writing for 
      websites and you kinda trailed off, 
      honey.

             OWEN
        (trying to save the 
         situation)
      So, Crash -- why dont you tell 
      this nice lady about the 21 days 
      you were up in The Show, and what 
      the crowds were like, and --

             CHARLIE
      It was crazy. I...

Charlie drifts off for a moment.

             CHARLIE 
        (to Millie)
      Im sorry -- Im sure youre a 
      great lady. You have lovely hands 
      and hair but...

Charlie begins to walk away, wobbly on his feet.

             CHARLIE 
      ...Im gonna go to the...Im just 
      gonna go. 

Charlie stumbles off.

             MILLIE
        (as Charlie leaves)
      You want a ride...?

Charlie exits the bar.

             MILLIE 
        (to Owen)
      Um...is he cool to drive?

             OWEN
      Yeah, hell be fine -- on his 
      bicycle.

             MILLIE
      He rides a bicycle?

             OWEN
      Oh, yeah -- 
        (smiles) 
      -- as a teenager, he was a bike 
      racing champion growing up in 
      Bloomington, Indiana. He and his 
      friends were called the Cutters -- 
      and they beat a bunch of rich 
      college kids in this big race. It 
      was great. 
             (MORE)


             OWEN 
        (beat) 
      Back then, I was a kickboxing 
      instructor...


EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Charlie rides his BICYCLE down the street. Swerving all over 
the place, hes obviously drunk.

Red and Blue LIGHTS flash behind him. Charlie turns to see --

-- a POLICE OFFICER.

INT. KATE & CHARLIES HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Charlie leaves Kate a VOICEMAIL MESSAGE.

             CHARLIE
        (into phone; seems sort of 
         nervous)
      So, I got into a little trouble -- 
      drunk in public. On a bicycle. 
        (beat)
      Um, I was thinking...maybe I need 
      to go to one of those meetings. Id 
      like to go with you, though. If 
      thats cool. 
        (beat)
      Let me know if we could discuss it 
      sometime, okay? Maybe you could 
      come over to our -- um, my house? 
        (beat) 
      Uh...yeah. Thanks.

Charlie hangs up the phone.

             CHARLIE 
        (to himself)
      Let me know if we could discuss it 
      sometime? 
        (shakes his head) 
      Such an idiot...


EXT. KATE & CHARLIES HOUSE - STREET/FRONT YARD - DAY

Kate and Charlie stand by Kates car, which is parked in 
front by the street. Shes just arrived. Awkward tension.

             CHARLIE
      Miss our house?

Beat.

             KATE
      Um...yeah. Sometimes.

             CHARLIE
        (hesitant)
      Miss me?

             KATE
      Sometimes. 
        (long beat) 
      Ive been sober for a year.

             CHARLIE
      Really?

             KATE
      Yeah. 


Kate reaches into her purse and takes out her ONE YEAR CHIP, 
showing it to Charlie.

             CHARLIE
      They gave you that?

             KATE
      Yeah. A couple of days ago. 
      Tuesday.

             CHARLIE
      Oh...wow.  Congratulations. Thats 
      really...really...just great. I 
      mean it. 
        (beat) 
      Tuesday is the night I got pulled 
      over. 
        (laughs) 
      Parallel lives, huh?

Kate rolls her eyes.

             CHARLIE 
      So -- you dating anyone?

             KATE
        (taken aback)
      Charlie...

             CHARLIE
      Are you?

Silence.

             KATE
      No.

Charlie seems relieved.

             CHARLIE
      Me either. Owen keeps trying to get 
      me to be his wing-man and its 
      ridiculous and these girls in bars 
      are so lame and I just keep 
      thinking how I wish I was meeting 
      you in a bar for the first time and 
      I didnt come with any baggage and 
      I could buy you a drink and flirt 
      with you all night and ask for your 
      number. 
        (beat)
      Wanna go out sometime?

             KATE
      I dont think its a good idea. 

Charlie nods. Long beat.

             CHARLIE
      I fucked up, didnt I?

Kate looks down, doesnt speak.

             CHARLIE 
      Yeah, I did. I know I did. I had a 
      beautiful woman who used to love me 
      and now when I see her she doesnt 
      even want to look me in the eyes.

             KATE
      Charlie, please dont do this.

             CHARLIE
      I miss you. I miss the way you 
      taste and smell and...I miss things 
      about you that used to drive me 
      nuts! I miss you liking shitty 80s 
      music and fake punk-rock from the 
      90s...

             KATE
      I dont like shitty 80s music. 
        (beat) 
      I like good 80s music.

             CHARLIE
      ...and all I want to do is touch 
      you one more time to just, remember 
      -- to make sure it was real. 

Silence. Kate looks Charlie in the eyes and gives him a 
slight smile.

             CHARLIE 
        (changing course)
      Or...maybe Im a just a delusional 
      fucking idiot.

INT. KATE & CHARLIES HOUSE - LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - DAY

Kate and Charlie walk in -- it looks sort of the same, but a 
number of items are missing, and its messier. In general, 
the room looks more dude.

             KATE
      You look really thin.

             CHARLIE
      Yeah?

             KATE
      When did you last eat?

             CHARLIE
      I dunno -- like...Im not sure. 
        (seems slightly concerned 
         that he cant remember) 
      I think, um...

             KATE
      Should we order something?

             CHARLIE
      Sure, yeah -- or I could make a 
      bacon and egg sandwich...

             KATE
      I dont know. I havent really been 
      doing the meat thing.

             CHARLIE
      Jesus. It starts with alcohol. Then 
      meat. 
        (beat) 
      Have you given up fun, too? 


Kate looks at Charlie -- hes half-smiling, not sure if she 
finds him funny. 

             CHARLIE 
        (off Kate)
      Sorry. Bad joke.

Kate cracks a smile.

             KATE
      Fine. Bacon and egg sandwiches. But 
      Im gonna make them.

Charlie raises his eyebrows.

             CHARLIE
      Okay...

LATER

Kates at the stove, cooking bacon and eggs.

Charlie goes to the FRIDGE and gets a BOTTLE OF BEER. 

Kate glances at him.

             CHARLIE 
      Sorry.

Charlie puts the beer back in the fridge.

             KATE
      I dont care if you drink a beer.

 
             CHARLIE
     You sure?

             KATE
      Yeah. Whatever.

             CHARLIE
        (thinks about it)
      No...Im good.

LATER

Kate stands by the stove and watches as --

-- Charlie -- who sits at the kitchen table -- wolfs down the 
bacon and egg sandwich.

Kate seems pleased that Charlie enjoys it so much.


EXT. KATE & CHARLIES HOUSE - BACKYARD - TWILIGHT


Kate and Charlie play croquet.


They look a little tired -- like theyve been playing a 
while. Kate seems to be much better than Charlie.


             CHARLIE
      Have you been playing a lot?

             KATE
      I havent played in over a year.

             CHARLIE
      Then howre you beating me?

             KATE 
      I dont know. Innate talent?

They keep playing.

             CHARLIE
      I havent met anyone even vaguely 
      interesting since we separated.

             KATE
      Um...stick to the game, okay?

             CHARLIE
      Ive been masturbating like crazy.

Long beat.

             KATE
      Charlie --

             CHARLIE
      I miss you. 

             KATE
      Stop it.

             CHARLIE
      Okay. Fine.

Beat.

             KATE
      You couldve been killed.

             CHARLIE
        (confused)
      What?

             KATE
      Riding your bike -- drunk.

             CHARLIE
      But I wasnt.

             KATE
      But is that really the point?

             CHARLIE
      What are trying to say?

             KATE
        (beat)
      I worry about you. 

             CHARLIE
        (laughs)
      Yeah, I can understand that. I used 
      to worry about you. But now I know 
      youre okay. 
        (beat)
      That makes me happy...I mean, it 
      fucking sucks that youre better 
      off without me but Im glad youre 
      doing well.

No reply from Kate.

             CHARLIE 
      Would you move back in if I came to 
      meetings?

             KATE
      You should go for yourself, not to 
      make me happy.

             CHARLIE
      But, would you?

             KATE
      Im not moving back in.

That wasnt the response Charlie wanted to hear. 

             KATE 
      Listen, I should go. Its gonna get 
      dark soon.

             CHARLIE
      We can always turn the lights on.

             KATE
      I dont know...

Beat.

             CHARLIE
      So, would you at least...let me 
      take you out on a date?

Kate says nothing.

             CHARLIE 
      Maybe...?

Kate shakes her head.

Charlie seems hurt -- but still determined.

             CHARLIE 
      Okay...fine. 0 for 2. 
        (new direction) 
      Last question: can we just...play 
      one more game?

Kate doesnt answer.

             CHARLIE 
      Cmon...you keep kicking my ass. 
      Its embarrassing. Youve gotta 
      give me a chance to redeem myself. 
        (soft) 
      Please.

Kate thinks about it for a long beat, and doesnt say yes...

...but she also doesnt say no.

Theres a look of hope in Charlies eyes.

THE END

CUT TO BLACK.
