FADE IN:

INT. SAN QUENTIN PRISON/CONDEMNED UNIT/MEETING ROOM - DAY

Windowless. A single steel door with a sliding viewing slit 
to peer inside. And- on a metal chair bolted to the floor- 

AGUSTIN "CULEBRA" SOL, Mexican death row inmate, watches DR. 
KAYLA "KAY" MARGOLIS (30's, striking) across the table as she 
jots something on a notepad.

             CULEBRA
     What you writing now?

             KAY
     The visions you saw... You said 
     that you've experienced them since 
     you were a teenager?

             CULEBRA
     Nah. Younger than that. Lot 
     younger. Since I was like, a 
     kid...I remember seeing shit when I 
     was a kid. Half the time I didn't 
     even know where I was.

             KAY
     Where did you think you were when 
     you entered the Wilsons' house?

Culebra ignores the question, eyes a DIGITAL VOICE RECORDER 
set beside her; it's capturing their conversation.

             CULEBRA
     Why you got that thing? It means 
     you don't gotta write nothing down 
     right?

             KAY
     There's a lot of things that 
     doesn't quite capture, like body 
     language, facial expressions, all 
     of which I need to take into 
     account.

             CULEBRA
     You think I'm lying to you or some 
     shit?

             KAY
     I never said that. I just wanna be 
     thorough. 

CONTINUED:

             KAY
     Because earlier you stated that the 
     visions started when you were 
     younger, and that you thought they 
     were a result of your father's 
     abuse.

             CULEBRA
     That ain't what I said.
        (as she continues jotting 
         notes; louder-)
     I said that ain't what I fuckin'
     said.

The viewing slit in the door slides open- A GUARD's eyes 
appear behind it. Kay gives the guard a subtle nod, "It's 
OK." But her gaze brushes past the manacles anchoring Culebra 
to his chair just to make sure. 

             KAY
     I'm not making a judgment call 
     here, Mr. Sol. I'm simply writing 
     everything you say down so that I 
     can review it later. That gonna be 
     okay with you?

That seems to calm him; he watches her keep writing.

             CULEBRA
     What you writing down now?
        (off silence)
     I asked you a question bitch.

Her eyes flick up.

             KAY
     You will address me with respect. 
     I'm here at your request, not 
     because I asked to be. Is that 
     understood?

He nods. Just once. 

             CULEBRA
     I'm sorry...

             KAY
     If you must know...I'm trying to 
     figure out why you never applied 
     for medication-

HE LUNGES. Kay recoils with a gasp as his manacles go taut- 
stopping his clawing hands an inch from her face- 

CONTINUED: ( 2)

- as THREE PRISON GUARDS barrel inside. Culebra is wrenched 
away - bucking, manages to shake them off for a moment and 
makes a final grab at Kay - spittle flies -

             CULEBRA
     - You fucking cunt- fucking white
     bitch - !

Finally- He's flattened, but it takes all three guards to 
hold him down and twist his arms back.

             CULEBRA 
     I'm gonna kill you bitch! I'm gonna
     cut your face open-!

A burly, bear-like man appears at the door, takes in the 
chaotic scene: Kay cowering in the corner - the three guards 
subduing Culebra. He watches as his guards manage to prop the 
enraged inmate up and drag him out of the room. The  man is 
Chief of Prison Personnel NOLAN DUBUC (40's). 

             NOLAN
     You okay?
        (she nods)
     You sure?

She nods again, still shaken. He approaches, kneels and picks 
up the fallen voice recorder with a sigh, shuts it off and 
hands it to her.

             NOLAN 
     You see why we prefer to use the 
     phone?

INT. NOLAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Kay stands before Nolan like a chastised schoolgirl. Photos 
of a plump housewife, two kids crowd his desk.

             KAY
     How can I expect them to open up to 
     me when I'm telling them that I 
     don't trust them before we even 
     start?

             NOLAN
     Don't ever forget that there's a 
     reason these men are where they 
     are. Culebra raped and butchered a 
     houseful of women because some 
     cartel member told him to, not some 
     "voice in his head." 

CONTINUED:

             KAY
     That's what I'm here to find out.

             NOLAN
     Wrong. You're here 'cause they're 
     scared. And that's it. These men 
     realize that they're about to 
     die...and suddenly they were crazy 
     at the time of the crime, suddenly 
     they're bipolar, or their daddy 
     touched them and messed them up, 
     and they manage to convince some 
     two-bit public defender that they 
     have a case hoping for a trip to
     the nut house instead of the 
     chamber. You're here 'cause of an 
     overly lenient legal system and 
     nothing else. Don't fool yourself.

             KAY
     Then with all due respect, Mr. 
     Dubuc, I'd like to at least do the 
     job that I was hired to do right. 
     If there was even a half a chance 
     that even one of these men is truly 
     sick, then I'd like to make the 
     State Board aware. That's all. And 
     I hope you can give me your support 
     with that.

Her defiant gaze tells him that he's not winning this fight. 

             NOLAN
     Guess I don't have a choice, do I?

He tosses a copy of a file in front of her.

             NOLAN 
     This next one's a real piece of 
     work. You'll see what I mean.

SAMUEL    DESMET: gaunt, shaved dome; homemade tats peek from 
his orange jumpsuit like the coils of a snake. 

CUT TO:

             NOLAN CONTINUED 
     He started a Haare Krishna cult out 
     of his garage, in which he was of 
     course a god, then executed a bunch 
     of construction workers when they
     caught him trying to set up a bomb. 

CONTINUED: ( 2)

Slowly PULL BACK TO REVEAL- Samuel is taking Kay in across 
the table with an odd expression. It's simultaneously 
studious and intense ... as if he were trying to decipher 
some puzzle hidden in the minutiae of her face.

             NOLAN CONTINUED 
     But hey, maybe deep down inside 
     he's a good guy.

             SAMUEL
     You look lovely. You seem even more 
     beautiful every time I see you.

             KAY
     This is the first time we've met.

             SAMUEL
     No it's not. You just don't 
     remember.

She jots all this down; the recorder beside her catches the 
entire conversation.

He smiles.

             KAY
     Let's start with the night of the 
     crime.

             SAMUEL
     You think I'm crazy.

             KAY
     I don't believe in that word. 

             SAMUEL
     Ah, that's right. You prefer the 
     word "sick." 

Her eyes flick up in surprise. 

             SAMUEL 
     It's what I always liked about you. 
     You're one of the few people I've 
     come across in all my lifetimes who 
     does what they do for the right 
     reasons.
        (sigh)
     Nevermind. Let's start at the night 
     of the crime...

She scribbles, "Pretending to have met..." But when she 
glances back up-

CONTINUED: ( 3)

ANOTHER INMATE (CHARLES BERESFORD) sits across from her.  

             KAY
     Why didn't you claim insanity 
     during your trial?

             CHARLES BERESFORD
     'Cause that ain't who I am. I don't 
     kill someone and try to get off on 
     some bullshit crazy plea.

             KAY
     But you're claiming insanity now.

             CHARLES BERESFORD
     'Cause things is different now.

INTERCUT BETWEEN SAMUEL AND CHARLES

             SAMUEL
     I didn't kill those people. Please 
     quote me on that.

             KAY
     You were tried and convicted.

             SAMUEL
     The court was paid off. 

             KAY
     By whom?

             SAMUEL
     Governor Albert Cayman of 
     California.

             KAY
     Who, according to your statement, 
     is a "god" as well.

Samuel takes a paranoid glance around, as if searching for 
hidden video cameras in the room, and lowers his voice.

             SAMUEL
     Listen to me. I'm not a guy on 
     death row trying to convince you to 
     let me out. I am the Lord of Light 
     and I'm here trying to save you and 
     everyone you know. 

Scribbles, "Lord of Light- incarnation of Hindu god Vishnu?"

BACK TO CHARLES BERESFORD

CONTINUED: ( 4)

             CHARLES BERESFORD
     You think I'm afraid to die? You 
     think that's why I'm doing this? My 
     family's dead, and I have to live 
     with the fact that it was 'cause of 
     me.  

             KAY
     So why the insanity plea now, three 
     weeks before your execution?

             CHARLES BERESFORD
     'Cause I realized that my mama had 
     bipolar issues and probably passed 
     them on to me.

BACK WITH SAMUEL- Who leans in, whispers-

             SAMUEL
     Charlie B, who you're talking to?
     He knows what he did. Ask him what  
     it was his son told him before he 
     locked him in his room that night. 
     "Are we playing a game?" You'll get 
     what you need. Trust me.

Kay takes Samuel in curiously. 

BACK WITH CHARLES BERESFORD

             KAY
     Can you describe the last moments 
     with your family, prior to setting 
     fire to the house? 

Charles Beresford grows visibly uncomfortable at the mention
of his crime.

             CHARLES BERESFORD
     Like I said, I wasn't in a good 
     frame of mind back then. I'd had 
     some substance issues in the past. 
     I don't remember.

             KAY
     I just need hear it from you, what 
     you thought was going on. It's 
     important. What did your son say 
     when you last saw him?

             CHARLES BERESFORD
        (tenses)
     Like I said. Just don't remember.

CONTINUED: ( 5)

             KAY
     Are we playing a game?
        (then)
     Mr. Beresford?

Beresford has gone immediately stiff, as if pierced by an
invisible arrow. The effect is immediate and surprising.

             KAY 
     Mr. Beresford?

Beat. Suddenly, his shoulders begin to quake... his face 
pinches. And in moments his entire body is RACKED BY SOBS.

             CHARLES BERESFORD
        (nods between tears)
     I knew what I was doing. I knew 
     what I was doing. I just don't 
     wanna die. I'm sorry. I killed 
     them. I killed my wife and my son. 
     My beautiful son. He was crying and 
     he was screaming and I kept the 
     door closed. I'm sorry, I fucked
     up... I'm so sorry...

A surprised Kay takes in the giant man before her as he weeps 
like a child.  

END ON-

             KAY
     How did you know?  

             SAMUEL
     Like I said. I'm not like these 
     other guys. I'm cursed. 

             KAY
     How so?

             SAMUEL
     With the knowledge of everything, 
     everything that has happened and 
     will happen again. 

             KAY
     You're the Lord of Light?

He nods, matter-of-fact:

             SAMUEL
     That's right.

EXT. SAN QUENTIN VILLAGE - EARLY EVENING

Kay's silver Volvo weaves through the tiny housing community 
hugging San Quentin State. It was built in the 1940's to 
house prison employees and their families.

VARIOUS SHOTS

Of the Volvo leaving San Quentin Village behind... Catch 
glimpses of the surrounding Marin County. And finally see the 
prison from far away: 

Cold. Angular. Lifeless. 

EXT. PALO ALTO NEIGHBORHOOD - EVENING

It's dark when her car pulls into the drive of a 

ONE STORY BUNGALOW.

The communities surrounding Stanford are quaint, family-
oriented; the antithesis to the State Penitentiary.

IN THE CAR

Kay shuts the headlights off and simply sits there, still 
recovering from the interviews. 

She glances over at the STACK OF INMATE FILES and a box of 
cassettes on the passenger seat.

INT. BUNGALOW HOME/KITCHEN - NIGHT

TROY COLLINS (31, fit) picks at a salad on the counter. 
Stanford folders, political science grad school books on a 
nearby table tell us all we need to know about him. 

Door opens as Kay enters and drops her valise on a couch 
beside myriad UNPACKED BOXES.

             TROY
     Lucky for you, I had to stay late 
     and cover for a TA. Otherwise the 
     food would've gone cold. Oh wait. 
     It did.

He notes her haggard expression.

             TROY 
     That bad, huh?

CONTINUED:

And now, her lips quake... He immediately sets the dishes 
down and crosses the living room - envelopes her in his arms. 
She manages not to cry.

             TROY 
     Hey. Hey. What's wrong?
        (tears escape)
     What happened?

LATER

He pours the rest of a wine bottle for her. Meal is gone.

             TROY 
     I say leave the job. It was a step 
     down to begin with. 

             KAY
     After just three days?

             TROY
     No one would blame you. 

             KAY
     And the new mortgage?

That matters. He thinks.

             TROY
     Well then tell me who I need to go 
     talk to. I'll start with the 
     asshole who attacked you. I can be 
     very convincing when I'm angry.

             KAY
     He killed a houseful of people for 
     a drug cartel.

             TROY
     Well then...let me know who to put 
     a phone call to.

Beat.

Brings a smile. But...

             KAY
     There's this one guy, Samuel; he 
     pretends to think he's a god and 
     that the Governor of California is 
     out to destroy the world.

CONTINUED: ( 2)

             TROY
     Governor Cayman? He might be right. 
     You seen his new budget proposal?

She smacks him playfully; he laughs.

             TROY 
     I'm serious. He's definitely out to 
     destroy the world.

             KAY
     It's not funny. I think this one 
     might actually be sick. He's very 
     convincing if he's not.

             TROY
     I don't like the sound of this guy.

             KAY
     He's scheduled to die in a week.  

             TROY
     Maybe you should let him.

Kay frowns. Troy senses an argument and rises.

             TROY 
     Goodnight. Don't spend too much 
     time in here. 

Leans in, plants a kiss-

             TROY 
     I'll feel like you're cheating on 
     me with Hannibal Lecter.

             KAY
     What are you doing?

Indeed, he was deftly sliding an OLD PHOTO into her notebook-
He smiles mischievously, caught-

             TROY
     I found it when I was unpacking the 
     albums. You remember that?

She turns the photo over- It's them, much younger, posing in 
front of the Lotus Temple in New Delhi. Scribbled on the 
back, "Kay and Troy, year abroad, '08." 

             TROY 
     It's the year I knew I loved you.

CONTINUED: ( 3)

That brings a smile. A kiss.

             TROY 
     I'm gonna crash.

She watches him head off, smitten; then her eyes travel to 
the INMATE FILES on the couch. Smile fades.

LATER

Clock on the wall tells us it's 2:07 am. The witching hour. 

ANGLE

Kay - illuminated by a halo of light from a portable desk 
lamp (from an unpacked box by her feet) - sits at the kitchen 
table flipping through SAMUEL'S FILES. See the gruesome crime 
scene photos of several dead men. Her smile is long gone.

INT. SAN QUENTIN PRISON/CONDEMNED UNIT/MEETING ROOM - MORNING

They sit across from each other.

CUT TO:

             KAY
     You wrote in your statement to 
     police that you were ready to die 
     in order to accomplish your goal, 
     but later had your lawyer retract 
     it. Why?

             SAMUEL
     My goal was only to kill him, not 
     anyone else. I wanted that made 
     clear.

             KAY
     But a bomb would've killed a few 
     more people than the governor, no?

             SAMUEL
        (sighs)
     Unfortunately...the stakes at play 
     here required the potential 
     sacrifice of other lives.  

             KAY
     The stakes?

             SAMUEL
     You've read my statements. 

CONTINUED:

             KAY
     That he'll destroy the world?

Kay purses a smile, does her best to hide her frustration.

             SAMUEL
     Look. It's all in my statements to 
     my lawyer. Everything is in there.

             KAY
     Your lawyer is the one who filed 
     for this review himself.

Samuel can't hide his surprise. 

             KAY 
     Your lawyer thinks you belong in an 
     institution Samuel. Every other 
     inmate requested me themselves, but 
     he requested I see you. That's why 
     I'm here.

For a moment, Samuel has nothing to say.

             SAMUEL
     Like I said, the sonofabitch was 
     paid off by Cayman too. I knew it 
     from the moment I met him, he was a 
     liar like Troy.

Kay is suddenly on her feet, eyes wide.

             KAY
     What did you say?

             SAMUEL
        (quickly)
     Nothing. Forget it.

             KAY
     No. How the hell did you know that 
     name?

The door slit slides open again.

             PRISON GUARD
     Everything okay?

Samuel looks suddenly sorry, like a chastised child.

             SAMUEL
     I'm sorry. That was a mistake. 

CONTINUED: ( 2)

             PRISON GUARD
     I said, everything okay in there!

Kay's eyes, frozen on Samuel. Trying not to show how much 
he's rattled her.

             KAY
     I think we're done here!

Kay collects her things, hardly throws Samuel another look as 
the guard opens the door and she starts out.

             SAMUEL
     Kay.

She freezes. Hesitates but turns back to him.

             KAY
     You'll address me as Doctor 
     Margolis if you want to continue to 
     see me. Is that understood?

Beat. He nods. But lifts his manacled hand, and extends his 
index finger to his left eyebrow.

             SAMUEL
     Be careful. Please. Last time it 
     cost you six stitches.

She doesn't answer, huffs out.

             KAY
     He knew my boyfriend's name.

INT. NOLAN'S OFFICE - DAY

She's pacing, furious. Nolan looks concerned.

             KAY
     I want to know how he got my file.

             NOLAN
     He's never read your file.

             KAY
     He or someone he knows did.  

             NOLAN
     No one here has read your file, not 
     even me.

             KAY
     Then how did he know Troy's name-

CONTINUED:

             NOLAN
     Did you tell him anything?

             KAY
     Not a thing.

             NOLAN
     Are you sure about that? Samuel 
     Desmet has a one hundred eighty-
     something IQ.

             KAY
     I'm aware.

             NOLAN
     Well did you say good afternoon? 
     How you doing? Change the pitch in 
     your voice at any point during your 
     conversation with him? Samuel can 
     glean something from anything. He 
     started a cult, for Christsakes.

He points out an engagement ring.

             NOLAN 
     He knows that you're engaged, for 
     instance. That you just moved here 
     with your guy-

             KAY
     How does he know that?

             NOLAN
     A woman doesn't buy a giant 
     bracelet like that for herself. I 
     know, I've bought my wife three.
     And the creases on your shirt told
     him that it probably came out of a 
     box this morning. 

She self-consciously brushes her fingers over her indeed-
wrinkled shirt.

             NOLAN 
     Even I can pick up those things, 
     and I don't have a fraction of 
     Samuel's mental capacity.

Kay still isn't settled.

             KAY
     But he knew Troy's name.

             NOLAN
     And I'm sure there's something you 
     did or said which allowed him to 
     figure it out. Listen to your 
     recording again, I'm sure it's in 
     there somewhere. His first day 
     here, he convinced a ten-year 
     veteran of my staff to let him walk 
     out of here, out of her own free 
     will. We almost had to fire her.

Beat.

             KAY
     What do you mean, almost had to 
     fire her?

INT. SEG UNIT/RECEIVING - DAY

A CHUBBY FEMALE GUARD, DEB STILSON (late 40's) - looks up 
from a newspaper (something about miners protesting the 
closing of mines) behind the mesh-iron Receiving Cage as Kay 
knocks on her door. She doesn't seem surprised by the visit.

EXT. PICK-UP/DROP-OFF BAY - DAY

The two women walk past the LOADING BAY outside the prison: 
workers unload boxes from supply trucks. 

Deb seems a bit embarrassed as they walk/talk:

             DEB
     Everyone's got that one story they 
     won't live down. I kinda always 
     hoped mine would have to do with 
     office sex or something.

Kay cracks a smile.

             KAY
     Is it true?

             DEB
        (sigh)
     Yeah. When he got brought in from 
     County, I was his escort on 
     transpo. We don't talk to the 
     inmates, ever, but there's nothing 
     we can do about listening to them. 
     And it was a long bus ride. The 
     guy's got a way with words, that's 
     for sure. 

CONTINUED:

             KAY
     What did he say?

             DEB
     He told me things about me that I'd 
     never told anyone before. It's like 
     if we'd met before. And at the end 
     of the trip he had me convinced 
     that I needed to let him walk out 
     of here. I'm embarrassed to even 
     talk about it, to be honest, so I 
     hope it's not something that needs 
     to be shared with others.

             KAY
     Of course not. During that 
     conversation, had you told him 
     anything about yourself?

             DEB
     Probably. I don't remember. He 
     plays mind games. He's like a 
     savant. When I saw you coming in, I 
     really wish I hadn't liked you so 
     much. Be careful with him.

Kay doesn't notice that Deb has stopped walking beside her -

             DEB 
     Honey -

When Kay glances over, she sees the GLINT of something 
flashing past her face as-

             DEB 
     Honey watch out- !

Deb yanks her aside moments before an unseen FORKLIFT turns 
with a pallet into a loading station. 

It almost broadsided her head.

             FORKLIFT DRIVER CONTINUED
     You okay there!

ON Kay, rattled. 

The crane would've hit her in the eyebrow, exactly where 
Samuel had pointed out.

             DEB
     You okay?

CONTINUED: ( 2)

Kay nods, but she's clearly not.

INT. VOLVO - EARLY EVENING

Door opens as Kay tosses her bag inside and slides in, slams 
the door closed and lets her head fall on the steering wheel. 
Another long day.

She spots something sticking out of her bag. Pulls out her 
notepad, where THE EDGE OF THE PHOTOGRAPH TROY SLID INSIDE 
LAST NIGHT peeks out. Names and date scribbled on the back.

It was visible to Samuel during their meeting.

INT. MEETING ROOM - THE NEXT DAY

She sits across from Samuel, does her best not to look too 
guarded. She spots a faint bruise under his cheek.  

             KAY
     What happened to your eye?

             SAMUEL
        (quickly)
     Nothing. 

She knows he's lying. Glances over at the steel door, where 
the guard is spying on them. 

             KAY
     Did they do that to you?

             SAMUEL
     I fell.

             KAY
     If you don't feel that you can be 
     open with me without repercussions, 
     you won't be honest with me. I'm 
     going to have a talk with them.

             SAMUEL
     -Don't. Please. 
        (then)
     It's only physical pain, Kay.
        (correct himself)
     Doctor Margolis. ... I don't 
     remember exactly when it is that 
     you get comfortable with me calling 
     you Kay, I think it's in a couple 
     of days. But it still feels strange 
     calling you "doctor."

CONTINUED:

             KAY
     No more games. We agreed to that.
        (off his look)
     Yesterday, you knew that Nolan 
     would approach Guard Stilson after 
     your comment about Troy. You knew 
     that her break was at 5:30 pm
     sharp, and you knew that's when 
     supplies are delivered to the 
     prison. I was told that two workers 
     have had accidents there in the 
     past month. You're clever. 

She points to her forehead.

             KAY 
     And you were right. I almost got 
     hit.
        (then)
     You have a gift, Samuel. There's no 
     doubt about that. I wanna know why 
     you would use those gifts to put 
     you in here.

             SAMUEL
     Ah, that's right. I "started a 
     cult." So did Muhammad. But I doubt 
     anyone would say that in public 
     today.

Kay ignores that.

             KAY
     Explain to me why you killed those 
     men in the construction site.


              SAMUEL
     I didn't. 

             KAY
    Who did?


             SAMUEL
     Governor Albert Marshall Cayman, 
     like I said-  

             KAY
     Enough.
        (beat)
     Please.

CONTINUED: ( 2)


             SAMUEL
     He wants me locked away in here 
     where I won't give him any more 
     trouble. That's the truth. Why 
     would I lie to you?

             KAY
     Why wouldn't he just kill you then?

             SAMUEL
     'Cause that wouldn't stop me.

He notes her frustration.

             SAMUEL 
     Listen to me: this Thursday, a 
     group of drunk kids in San Diego 
     will break into the naval base down 
     there. They're just drunk kids and 
     they're caught in about ten 
     minutes, but Albert Cayman will use 
     it to plant the seeds to move the
     naval base to a quote-unquote safer 
     place. You'll see it all over the 
     news. And when he's senator, he 
     passed a bill to move the base to 
     Hawaii, which is what'll cause a 
     chain of events that instigates a 
     nuclear war-

             KAY
     Stop right there.

Kay reaches over and presses pause on the voice recorder, 
rewinds it and re-plays what he just said:

             SAMUEL
     And when he's senator, he passed a 
     bill to move the base to Hawaii, 
     which is what'll cause a chain of 
     events...

She hits pause again.

             KAY
     Listen to what you just said. "When
     he's senator, he passed a bill
     which will cause a chain of 
     events." Earlier, you said that you 
     don't remember                 when I get 
     comfortable with you, but it's in a 
     couple of days. You can't remember 
     something that hasn't happened yet.

CONTINUED: ( 5)

             SAMUEL
     The only difference between 
     everyone else and men like Cayman 
     and myself, men like Jesus and 
     Buddha and others throughout 
     history that have shaped your 
     world, is that we remember the 
     future because to us it's the past. 
     I know what I know about you 
     because we've sat in this very room 
     before and had this very same 
     conversation countless times- 

             KAY
     Stop right there...

But he leans in, mile-a-minute-

             SAMUEL
     -Cayman is a Pilocyte, like me. We 
     have the same disease; it's our 
     gift but it's also our curse-

             KAY
        (firm)
     I said that's enough.

Finally he stops, and leans back in his chair - watches as 
Kay flips through a copy of his file and finds a xeroxed copy 
of his MEDICAL REPORT.

             KAY 
     You were diagnosed with pilocytic
     astrocytoma when you were young. 
     It's a benign brain tumor affecting 
     mostly children before puberty. 
        (but)
     It's not a disease Samuel. It has 
     no effect on patients. It's been 
     medically proven.

             SAMUEL
     How many times has something been 
     medically proven then debunked when 
     science catches up with the facts? 
     Pilocytic astrocytoma affects a 
     very small part of the population 
     and doctors have no idea what it 
     does, but I'm telling you what it 
     does: it keeps our memories intact 
     from life to life.

             SAMUEL
     There are those of us who start 
     religions or governments or 
     countries because we think it'll 
     help humanity, but there are those 
     who want to destroy it because 
     they're tired of being reborn, like 
     Cayman, Mussolini-

             KAY
     You've heard of delusions of 
     grandeur.

             SAMUEL
     -And you've heard of the men who 
     stood before Jesus and spit in his
     face.

She studies his eyes closely, but he doesn't blink. He 
believes every word he's saying.

             SAMUEL 
     He's in Wisconsin right now,
     fishing, wondering if he actually 
     helped the world out or not.

CUT TO:

EXT. WOODS OUTSIDE LARKSPUR - EARLY EVENING

Kay's Volvo parks on unpaved dirt in front of a Swedish Cope 
LOG CABIN in the middle of the woods. Only the light in the 
kitchen tells us that someone still lives here.

             KAY
     Thanks for seeing me on such short 
     notice.

INT. LOG CABIN - MOMENTS LATER

CLAUDE DESMET (60's) pours her coffee on the kitchen table - 
as Kay throws a discreet look around ... paint-peeled siding, 
torn furniture. Claude's resemblance to Samuel is striking: 
he's a wrinkled, white-haired version of his son.

             CLAUDE
        (thick Belgian accent)
     That lawyer stopped by a couple of 
     weeks back. I suggested he file the 
     plea. 

Kay is surprised to hear that.

CONTINUED:

             KAY
     You believe that your son's sick, 
     Mr. Desmet?

An old Plott hound suddenly bounds in, leaps on Kay-

             CLAUDE
     Oswald-!

             KAY
     It's okay-

But Claude grabs the dog, gently but firm, mutters something 
in French that makes the old hound slink back outside.

             KAY 
     You're French?

             CLAUDE
     Belgian. 

FOLLOW Claude as he heads back to the kitchen, leaving Kay to 
take the place in: Everything caked in a layer of dust.

             KAY
     When did you come to the States?

             CLAUDE
     Twenty years ago. Samuel was 
     actually not born here. The entire 
     family was born in Belgium. We came 
     when he was about ten.

Kay's attention is caught by a mantle above the stone chimney 
LINED WITH PHOTOGRAPHS: a young Samuel, twin sisters, a 
woman. It's the only place in the house kept clean. A shrine. 

             KAY
     What brought you to the States?

Claude lets out a sad laugh as he approaches the mantle.

             CLAUDE
     The stupidest thing. My wife grew 
     up in an old house outside 
     Brussels. When she was a girl she 
     found this box full of old 
     postcards in her basement with 
     photos of Marin County...yes, this 
     Marin County, along with old vinyl 
     records of American music from San 
     Francisco. 

CONTINUED: ( 2)

             CLA UDE ( CONT 'D)
     I'm not sure how they got there, 
     probably some American backpacker 
     from years before, but she became 
     obsessed with this country. This 
     area in particular. I had a few 
     good years in investment banking 
     and we had the option to retire 
     early, so we decided to come here 
     for a few years with the kids.

Claude picks up a B&W photo of the elegant Belgian woman in a 
glass frame. RACK FOCUS TO HIS REFLECTION- staring at his 
wife with melancholy.

             CLAUDE 
     She died of cancer a few years 
     after we arrived. The children were 
     already settled here, there was no 
     more going back for them. I don't 
     regret it to be honest. She got to 
     die in the place she wanted to be 
     most. And she never had to see 
     Samuel how he became. 

He sets the photo back down and approaches the table with a 
small PHOTO ALBUM.

             CLAUDE 
     Losing her was difficult, but I 
     think it happened for a reason. It 
     was better than living and seeing 
     him...
        (trails off)

             KAY
     Kill those people?
        (Claude nods)
     And his sisters...they still speak? 

Claude shakes his head.

             CLAUDE
     They have their own lives to worry 
     about. It's not exactly something 
     you want to speak to friends about, 
     as I'm sure you can imagine. A 
     brother in jail awaiting death. One 
     of my girls is actually about to 
     have a child herself. 

             KAY
     Congratulations.

CONTINUED: ( 3)

Claude sets the album in front of Kay and takes a seat. She 
opens it- The photos are all from the 80's and 90's - a young 
Samuel with his sisters. Typical happy family. It's a 
haunting contrast to Samuel today.

             CLAUDE
     He's not a bad man, miss...

             KAY
     Call me Kay.

             CLAUDE
     He's truly confused. The lawyer 
     came to ask for my advice and I 
     told him the truth: if there is 
     anyone out there who truly deserves 
     the insanity plea it's my son. He 
     hasn't been well in years.

             KAY
     When did Samuel get sick?

The old man sighs. And from his tone of voice, we can tell 
that it's a conversation he's had many times before.

             CLAUDE
     When he was thirteen. A few months 
     after his tumor diagnosis. I 
     remember the day exactly, he came 
     back from soccer practice on a 
     Wednesday afternoon and looked at 
     me as if I was a stranger in my own 
     house. He began speaking different 
     languages around the house and 
     telling us that he had been these 
     great men in past lives and had 
     been put here to help us do this 
     and help the world do that. I 
     checked with the coach if he had 
     hit his head. 
        (sad laugh)
     It was as if he had left my son and 
     came back a different person. He 
     got more delusional as time went on 
     so we took him to several doctors 
     who said the tumor had nothing to 
     do with it-

             KAY
     Were the languages real?
        (off Claude's look)
     The languages he was speaking. Did 
     you have him tested?

CONTINUED: ( 4)

             CLAUDE
     I did. We took him to a language 
     specialist, and yes, the languages 
     were real. And he spoke them 
     fluently. But Samuel had always 
     been a bright boy, he was going to 
     an advanced school, and he had 
     always studied languages. Have you 
     heard of people who hit their heads 
     and suddenly they can play the 
     piano perfectly, or are hypnotized 
     and can suddenly recall vivid 
     details of a supposed past life 
     that seems too real to be made up? 
        (Kay nods)
     Most doctors who study these cases 
     will tell you that these "memories" 
     are created from books these people 
     have read or movies they've seen 
     mixed with a very vivid 
     imagination. The human mind is an 
     amazing tool, and I believe that we 
     have not yet figured out all of its 
     secrets, but that does not mean 
     that Samuel is some... Hindu God. 
     Three specialists told us the same 
     thing. He's not well in the head. 
     So please, doctor...if you have any 
     say in this, please save my son's 
     life. He shouldn't die. He doesn't 
     know what he's doing.

The desperation in Claude's face is heart-breaking. Kay can't 
find the words to respond. She simply nods.

             CLAUDE 
     I think I'm finally going to go 
     back to Belgium. Tell Samuel that 
     when you see him.

As Claude gets up with the groan of aging joints...

             CLAUDE 
     Can I get you more coffee?

             KAY
     I'm okay. I think I've heard what I 
     need to hear.

...and heads to the kitchen...

             CLAUDE
     I was going to leave a few years 
     back, but...

Suddenly he supports himself on the kitchen counter, his back 
to Kay. He looks dazed.

             KAY
     But what?
        (off silence)
     Mr. Desmet?

She rises, concerned, and is shocked to see his shoulders 
shaking. He's weeping silently. Kay rushes to him but he 
signals her away, angles his face, ashamed to be seen crying. 
The hound bounds back in, as if sensing its master's tears.

             CLAUDE
     But he told me that you were going 
     to come, and that I needed to wait 
     for you. Because you were his 
     consort, and he needed you to 
     believe.

ON Kay, shocked.

             CLAUDE 
     And so that I would know it too.

Claude does his best to stop his tears.

             KAY
     When did you last speak to him?

             CLAUDE
     About two years ago. 

             KAY
     But-

             CLAUDE
     He told me your name.

She's speechless. Finally he looks over and wipes the tears, 
gives her the first genuine albeit sad smile we've seen:

             CLAUDE 
     I've been waiting for six long 
     goddamn years for you to come... 
     just in case. 

LATER

CONTINUED: ( 6)

AN OLD CARDBOARD BOX labeled "Samuel" falls on the table in 
front of Kay. 


             CLAUDE 
     This is everything that belonged to 
     him, from when he was a kid. He 
     wanted me to give it to you.  

             KAY
     I can't take all this from you.

             CLAUDE
     Please. I think it's about time I 
     move on.

Indeed, he looks like a new man. Refreshed.

             KAY
     I might call you-

             CLAUDE
     I won't be here.
        (then)
     Tell him... Just tell him goodbye 
     for me, okay? And that we still 
     love him.

With a final grateful nod she heads out, but stops and turns
at the door. Seems almost afraid to ask-

             KAY
     What did he mean, by his consort?

             CLAUDE
     Excuse me?

             KAY
     You said he referred to me as his 
     consort. Do you know what he meant?

             CLAUDE
     Laxmi, I think.
        (off her look)
     What can I say, I was curious so I
     took a trip to the library.

But her look tells him that she still doesn't understand. 

             CLAUDE 
     Hindu deities come in pairs. They 
     have female partners, or consorts. 
     Vishnu is the preserver of the 
     universe, Laxmi is his consort.

     She helps him accomplish his goals
     in every life.

Beat.

             KAY
     I'm not a consort, Mr. Desmet. And 
     I can't promise you that I'll stop 
     his execution. I hope you're okay 
     with whatever decision I have to 
     make. 

Beat. He nods.

             KAY 
     Have a good day.

A shaken Kay exits.

INT. VOLVO - NIGHT

Parked on the side of a country-side road. Kay - staring 
straight ahead. Throws a diffident look over at the CARDBOARD 
BOX waiting on the passenger seat. Opens it and digs out an 
aged COMPOSITION JOURNAL labeled, "Samuel Desmet, 1993." From 
when Samuel was thirteen.

She opens it and reads, as we hear SAMUEL'S VOICE...

             SAMUEL
     When I started getting my memories 
     back, I finally understood the 
     world as it truly was, why certain 
     government systems and religions 
     exist and who had created them. I 
     remembered my encounter with 
     Genghis Khan.

EXT. A TEMPLE IN THE CITY OF KHAREZEM - 1219

GENGHIS KHAN - as looked in real life: short, stocky. Full-
body caftan. Not the romanticized image that has survived 
history books.

             SAMUEL
     The man who single-handedly 
     butchered more people than anyone 
     on earth. 

BACK TO SCENE

As Kay reads.

CONTINUED:

             SAMUEL
     And how I, as a Native American, 
     had traveled half the world to kill 
     him. Historians would have a field 
     day if they knew.

A PALACE, EASTERN IRAN - 1219

A 13TH CENTURY PUEBLO INDIAN (yes, a Native American) stands 
before the great Genghis Khan, surrounded by armed Mongols. 
The Mongols take him in curiously - they've never seen anyone 
who looks like him in this part of the world. In fact, 
according to history, a Native American never traveled to 
this part of the world.

About to be killed, the Indian suddenly drops to one knee - 
pries up an EMPTY SPACE on the tile, where a KNIFE lies 
covered in fifty years of dust - attacks with a scream -

             SAMUEL
     I had left a hidden blade for 
     myself a half century before and 
     with it nearly ended Genghis Khan's 
     life. Sadly I missed his throat by 
     two centimeters. 

INT. MEETING ROOM - THE NEXT DAY

Kay now sits across from Samuel, who's pointing to two very 
specific areas of his throat:

             SAMUEL
     From here, to about here. Two more 
     centimeters to the left, and 
     history would have completely 
     changed. Genghis Khan was so 
     embarrassed at having nearly lost 
     his life to my trickery that he 
     forbade anyone ever speak of it or 
     be put to death. That's why it's 
     never made its way into books.
        (a smirk)
     That's why you're staring at me as 
     if I were a crazy man on death row.

Samuel laughs. Indeed, Kay is staring as if he were an alien.

THE METAL DOOR...

...Where a pair of eyes watches through the viewing slit. 

CUT TO:

CONTINUED:

It's Nolan. 

His eyes narrow. He looks over at his guard.

             NOLAN
     How long have they been in there?

             PRISON GUARD
     About an hour.

Nolan looks down at his watch, frowns.

BACK TO SCENE

             SAMUEL
     All religions are fabricated but 
     some got a few things right. 
     Reincarnation is very much a part 
     of life. We just happen to remember 
     every life.

BAM-BAM-BAM. They look over. The guard is knocking.

             NOLAN
     Time's up!

Samuel leans in, whispers:

             SAMUEL
     Look, I got proof that I am who I 
     say I am. Troy took you to an 
     Italian cafe two months ago. You've 
     never told anyone about it, right?

             KAY
        (shaken)
     Please stop.

             SAMUEL
     -There's a library across the 
     street from that cafe. You'll find 
     a book in a red cover in the non-
     fiction section right before the 
     back wall. I wrote it ninety-seven 
     years ago when I was a French 
     diplomat so that you could read it 
     today. Because I knew this day 
     would come and you'd need proof.

CONTINUED: ( 2)

             KAY
     Samuel, you understand that 
     delusion and insanity are defined 
     as two very different things in the 
     eyes of the law?

BAM-BAM-BAM!

             NOLAN
     I said time's up!

Kay rises and gathers her things...

             SAMUEL
     Are you willing to at least go look 
     at the proof?

INT. VOLVO (MOVING) - EARLY EVENING

Kay is on her cell as she drives home.  SPLAT, a raindrop 
slaps the windshield. 

In moments it's POURING. She flicks on the wipers, but the 
rain BLURS the upcoming exit to "Hillcrest Dr - 1 3/4 Miles."

             KAY
     Don't hate me, but I'm gonna be 
     about a half hour late.
        (listens)
     I promise. No more work. Tonight 
     it's you and me. 
        (then)
     Gives you an extra half hour to get 
     ready for me.

She hangs up and takes the Hillcrest exit, but sighs and 
shakes her head, "What am I doing?"

INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - NIGHT

She moves past bookshelves. The rain outside sounds like tiny 
bullets on tin.

She reaches the NON-FICTION SECTION facing the back wall and 
spots THE RED BOOK. "A Perfect Circle" by Anonymous. 

She glances around nervously before sliding it out, as if she 
were doing something illegal. It's caught the attention of an 
unseen LIBRARIAN, who quietly approaches. 

             LIBRARIAN
     Everything okay?

CONTINUED:

Kay nearly jumps out of her skin.

MOMENTS LATER, AT THE CHECKOUT BOOTH

The librarian stamps the back flap with a rubber stamp.

             LIBRARIAN 
     You can usually find out who the 
     author is from the publishing 
     house. But this one -
        (flips to the front of the 
         book, reads through page)
     Was put out almost a hundred years 
     ago by some little house in Paris, 
     which also did the translation. I 
     could bet you that it's gone out of 
     business by now.
        (hands book over)
     Congratulations though, you're only 
     the second person to ever check it 
     out.  

             KAY
     Who was the first?

             LIBRARIAN
     I'm afraid we don't give out that 
     information-

Kay sets a hundred dollar bill on the table. 

Librarian stares at the bill, then up at Kay.

             KAY
     I'm just curious.

CUT TO:

THE BOOK lies closed on a night stand - Suddenly it SHAKES as 
the edge of a bed smacks the night stand -

INT. BUNGALOW HOME/BEDROOM - NIGHT

SOUNDS OF SEX CONTINUED

Kay and Troy make love under the sheets. We can tell that 
they've been at it for a while. Sweaty. Climaxing. Finally 
Troy rolls over, breathing hard.

             TROY
     Wow.

He envelopes her in his arms.

CONTINUED:

             KAY
     Maybe we should always wait that 
     long.

He pretends to think about it.

             TROY
     Nah. Not worth it.

She laughs. Rests her head on his chest. After a moment, 
grows serious.

             KAY
     Remember our date when we first 
     visited? You took me to that little 
     Italian cafe on Hillcrest?

             TROY
     Yeah?

             KAY
     Who have you told about that?

             TROY
     No one. Why?

             KAY
     You sure?

He glances over, knows where this is coming from.

             TROY
     How was your meeting with the guy 
     today? The cult leader?

             KAY
     I'm gonna recommend that the state 
     send him to an institution. This 
     guy...he's not just delusional, I 
     mean, he is but- He sees the world 
     in a completely fictitious way that 
     justifies the murders in his own 
     head. He thinks he's saving the 
     world from a nuclear holocaust that 
     starts in San Diego.

Troy laughs. She reaches over and grabs a notebook from the 
floor, reads a transcribed conversation with Samuel:

CONTINUED: ( 2)

             KAY 
     On Thursday, a group of drunk guys
     will break into the naval base in 
     San Diego and make it to within 
     thirty meters of a nuclear 
     submarine. In a year, Cayman will 
     be a senator and use that incident 
     as one of many to pass a bill to 
     move the naval base to Hawaii. 

Troy's smile falters.

             KAY 
     And in 2021... a group of 
     extremists from Myanmar will hijack 
     a nuclear sub off the coast of 
     Hawaii. U.S. will mobilize against 
     Myanmar and China will attack.

Troy is oddly silent now.

             KAY 
     You see, he's found a way to make 
     it all make sense. Like the shot 
     that killed Archduke Ferdinand and 
     started World War I. Transferred 
     logic is a clear symptom of 
     schizophrenia. 

             TROY
     How did he know Governor Cayman is 
     running for the Senate?

Kay can't hide a reaction.

             KAY
     Has it been announced?

             TROY
     I mean. It's started leaking into 
     the blogosphere, but it hasn't hit 
     the news yet. I doubt he has access 
     to the internet-

             KAY
     No, but someone around him might've
     mentioned it. That's all it would 
     take with this guy.

Troy digests that.

CONTINUED: ( 3)

             TROY
     And all that Hindu stuff...did that 
     start before or after he saw that 
     you'd studied in India?

Good point.

             TROY 
     He's playing with you. It's 
     obvious. He's just trying to get 
     you to get him off death row. 

             KAY
     I studied his face when he was 
     telling me his theories; he 
     believes every word he says. 

Troy takes her in. Rises and grabs a nearby robe-

             TROY
     I'm gonna take a shower.

A moment later, we can hear the shower running.

             KAY
     How're classes coming! How's the 
     campaign! 

             TROY
     It's good!  We're up on every poll!

Beat.

             KAY
     Want me to join you!

             TROY CONTINUED
     I'm gonna make it quick!

She sighs. Looks over at-

THE BOOK. "A PERFECT CIRCLE." Sitting on her dresser.

             TROY
     Hey! Look at the bright side!
     Tomorrow's Thursday! Unless someone 
     actually breaks into that naval 
     base in San Diego, you'll be able 
     to tell him he's full of shit!

That's true.

Kay opens the book.

THWIP-THWIP-THWIP! ARROWS PIERCE SCREAMING MEN.

-As an Egyptian Army collides against a Nubian wall. 10,000 
men strong: crude battle-axes clash with flint spears and 
curved blades. Luxor. Circa 2123 BC.

             SAMUEL
     Not even learned historians know of 
     the true life of Iket Shepsut, a 
     fellow Pilocyte peasant who in 2123 
     BC became one of Egypt's greatest 
     generals.

Suddenly- a spear drives its way through IKET SHEPSUT'S armor- 

REVEAL A NUBIAN GENERAL holding the spear. Glaring. On Iket's
wide eyes: recognition, before life leaves his eyes -

             SAMUEL
     Had he lived, Iket Shepsut would 
     have ran the Queen's army from the 
     southern tip of Kush to the capital 
     of Assyria, killing more Nubians, 
     Hittites, and even fellow Egyptians 
     than anyone in history. He would 
     have become the first self-made 
     Pharaoh in history. For most, that 
     is a theory. But for the Nubian 
     General who ended his life, it was 
     a fact. Because it had happened 
     before.

             TROY CONTINUED
     No work, huh?

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Troy's voice snaps us back to reality, as he enters wrapped 
in a towel, drying his hair before sliding on boxer shorts. 
He plops down beside Kay. 

             KAY
     Just reading. For fun. 

He nods, opens up his own poli-sci book.

             TROY
     I'm done with the shower.

She nods but doesn't get up. Continues reading, intrigued 
despite herself.

     What's the book?

             KAY
     Huh?

             TROY
     What you're reading.

             KAY
     Oh. Recommendation from a friend.

SHE FLIPS THE PAGE...

And stops reading. Because a line in the book says... 

"He's cheating on you Kay. Don't believe a word he says."

She doesn't move. Can't. Reads the line over and over to make 
sure that the sentence is really there.

             TROY
     Well. Let me know if it ends up 
     being any good.

She purses a smile, but can't hide the pallor on her face.

             TROY 
     You okay?

She sets the book down and gets up.

             KAY
     Yeah. I'm gonna go shower.

Stumbles toward the shower like a zombie.

He's left confused, looks over at the book before going back 
to his studying.

EXT. A RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD/SAN JOSE, CA - EARLY MORNING

A FRAGILE HOUSEWIFE (ELEANOR GATES) emerges from her house, 
carrying coats across the lawn for her two young daughters 
who wait for a school bus on the curb of their humble home. 

She halts when she spots the Volvo parked across the street. 

Kay emerges from the car and crosses the street, and Eleanor 
freezes at the sight of the red library book in her hand.

CONTINUED:

             KAY
     You have a quick second to chat 
     Mrs. Gates?

She takes Kay in with something like fear.

INT. SAN QUENTIN PRISON/CONDEMNED UNIT - DAY

Nolan stands conversing with a guard at his post when he 
spots Kay marching past.

             NOLAN
     Agustin Sol's execution is today. 
     You know you're expected to attend.

             KAY
     I'll be there.

She hurries past.  

             NOLAN

She turns. Visibly stiff.

             NOLAN 
     Today's your last day with Samuel. 
     Let's make it quick, okay? We need 
     to submit your report to the State 
     Board by five p.m. 

She quickly nods and heads through Receiving.

INT. MEETING ROOM - DAY

Samuel looks up from the bolted table as the steel doors shut 
behind Kay. He's excited to see her.

             SAMUEL
     Do you believe me now?

She drops the book on the table with a loud THWAP. Only now 
does Samuel seem to notice the dark circles under her eyes. 
She clearly didn't get much sleep last night.

             KAY
     You almost had me. 
        (off his confused look)
     Eleanor Gates. 

His face falls at the mention of the name.

             KAY 
     I tracked her down.

She sets her voice recorder on the table and hits Play, and 
we hear a conversation recorded earlier that morning:

     Mrs. Gates...do you mind if I 
     record this?

INSERT: INT. TRACT HOUSE IN SAN JOSE, CA - EARLIER THAT DAY

We see the scene from that morning, with the voice recorder 
playback serving as the soundtrack to the scene.

Kay - sitting on a couch across from Eleanor Gates, as the 
mother of two meekly shakes her head. She has the demeanor of 
a former cult member.

             KAY (VOICE RECORDER)
     Have you seen this book before?

We see Kay mouth the words as she sets the book down on a 
coffee table before Eleanor, who shyly shakes her head.

             KAY (VOICE RECORDER) 
     How do you know about this book?

Suddenly Eleanor breaks down in tears.

             ELEANOR GATES (VOICE RECORDER)
     I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I didn't 
     mean to hurt anyone, I swear. I 
     didn't know what he wanted it for.

BACK TO SCENE

             KAY
     She told me about the letter you 
     wrote her from here, instructing 
     her on how to tailor an old book to 
     make it seem like something that 
     had been written ninety-seven years 
     ago. She told me that you 
     threatened her life if she didn't.  

Samuel looks genuinely shocked.

             SAMUEL
     That's a lie... 

CONTINUED:

             KAY
     She replaced a book with this one 
     as per your instructions.

Samuel looks around, panicked eyes, as if the walls were 
closing in on him.

             SAMUEL
     He must've gotten to her... he 
     must've threatened her life...

             KAY
     -Stop it-

             SAMUEL
     -Cayman must've gotten to her this 
     time around because he knew that 
     you would visit her, so he used it 
     to make it look like I'm lying. 
     He's being extra-careful now.
        (off her look)
     This has all happened before Kay.
     Don't you see? He's caused the 
     apocalypse before, but he hasn't 
     broken the circle because he keeps 
     being reborn- but he's finally 
     figured out why.

He's mile-a-minute now, excitable:

             SAMUEL 
     The miners, Kay. 'Cause of the 
     people underground. There were 
     miners below the surface when the 
     bombs came down last time. There 
     were still people left, you see? 
     But he'll make sure there's no one 
     left this time around so that the 
     world will end for good- He's 
     already doing what he can to shut 
     mines down across the country- 

Kay reacts at that statement. He doesn't notice.

             SAMUEL 
     - and he'll make sure everyone dies
     when it all goes down this time. 
     That's why he's being extra careful 
     now and managed to catch me with 
     the book. It was my fault, I 
     should've anticipated-  

Kay finally explodes.

             KAY
     Enough with the games already!

He's surprised by her reaction.

     I'm just trying to think what else 
     he could've done-

             KAY
     You're making things up.

             SAMUEL
     Never! Everything I've ever told 
     you is the truth-

             KAY
     You wanna look at the truth? Here 
     it is! Look at it!

Kay opens the book and BENDS THE SPINE, revealing: a new 
manuscript has been inserted between an aged red cover to 
make it seem like an old book.  

The book is a fake.

             SAMUEL
     That sonofabitch...

Kay notices that the guard is peering at them, keeping a 
close eye on Samuel.

             KAY
     I'm going to recommend an 
     institution. You're going to be 
     taken away today.

             SAMUEL
        (eyes wide)
     No...

             KAY
     Unfortunately I have to make my 
     decision based on the facts I see.

             SAMUEL
     There are things in the world that 
     cannot be seen-!

             KAY
     And here are the facts I see                         !

Door opens.

CONTINUED: ( 3)

             PRISON GUARD
     Everything okay in there?

Beat.

             KAY
     Everything's okay. We're fine.
        (then)
     Give us a moment?

Beat. The door closes.

             KAY 
     Here are the facts I see. You 
     killed seven men-

             SAMUEL
     I didn't kill those construction 
     workers, Albert Cayman had them 
     shot - He anticipated me going to 
     set that bomb and waited 'til I got 
     there - The men were already dead 
     when I arrived-

        KAY
And yet here you are, 
arrested-

	SAMUEL
	-he wanted me thrown in jail
	so that I wouldn't just kill myself and come back after 
	  him-

             KAY
     You started a cult out of a garage 
     and took peoples' life savings-

             SAMUEL
     I told them everything that I've 
     told you! I showed them the truth 
     like I've shown it to you and they 
     donated their money for the cause-

             KAY
     -And you approached one of those 
     former cult members and threatened 
     her life if she didn't help! You've 
     seen it with your own eyes!
        (Samuel falls silent)
     You need help Samuel. If you can't 
     see the facts as I've just told 
     them to you, then you're truly 
     sick. And I have no choice but to 
     send you away.

CONTINUED: ( 4)

Samuel looks increasingly frantic, takes a look around and 
moves to rise but- CLANK. The manacles don't let him stand. 

             KAY 
     I think we're done here!

The door opens as the guard enters to take Samuel away. 
Suddenly Samuel LUNGES, SLICES his skin open on his 
restraints but manages to grab Kay - pulls her close - 
whispers in her ear as she SCREAMS:

             SAMUEL
     If you send me away, I'll be locked 
     up for good - I won't be able to 
     stop him and everyone you know and 
     love will die - !

But the guard is trying to yank him away - 

ON Kay, frozen stiff, flecked with Samuel's blood - As the 
guard pulls out a baton and brings it down, once, twice - 
Samuel still doesn't budge - 

             PRISON GUARD
     I need help!

Samuel keeps his grip on a terrified Kay as he's jerked away-

             SAMUEL
        (pleads)
     Listen to me Kay - if you send me 
     to that institution they will put 
     me in a straightjacket and I will 
     have to watch as he destroys the 
     world for good! 

A second prison guard barrels in, swings his baton - Samuel 
HOWLS in pain and Kay is able to extricate herself as the two 
guards flatten Samuel, grind his face to the ground and 
wrench his bloody arms behind his back. He nonetheless 
continues to buck and scream:

             SAMUEL 
     Please! You need to let me die! You 
     need to let me die so that I can 
     get out - !

Suddenly he throws his head back - breaks second guard's nose 
- As more guards run in and drag him away, ripping his prison 
jumpsuit, hiking his shirt up to reveal -

-His torso covered top-to-bottom in home-made prison tattoos 
of circles with three points along the edge. 

CONTINUED: ( 5)

ON Kay, eyes wide, watching as he's dragged away screaming.

And- when he's gone, she lets herself break down. Crying 
silently. Until she catches sight of-

Nolan, standing at the door. Taking her in with a mixture of 
anger and sympathy. He's not going to comfort her this time.

             NOLAN
     I'm just happy it's done.

INT. NOLAN'S OFFICE - SAME

Closed-doors- Kay, settled into a chair across from Nolan.

             NOLAN
     I could see it taking its toll on 
     you. No offense, but I don't trust 
     anyone around him for too long, not 
     even a smart one like you.

             KAY
     Gimme a break. 

             NOLAN
     Did he tell you about the Prime 
     Minister of Israel?

             KAY
     What? The he used to be Joseph 
     Smith?

             NOLAN
     I always kinda liked that. He 
     starts up the Mormons and then ends 
     up as a Jew.

They laugh. He studies her closely... Then-

             NOLAN 
     Good. 'Cause you're growing on me
     doctor, and I was this close to 
     transferring you out.

She lets that little fact settle.

             KAY
     He believes that Jesus is fishing 
     in Wisconsin right now. He tell you 
     that? 

CONTINUED:

             NOLAN
        (laughs)
     No I hadn't heard that one.

             KAY
     That's not the craziest one either. 

             NOLAN
     Actually that is the craziest one.
     Ever tried fishing in Wisconsin 
     this time of year? Lakes are all 
     frozen. Unless you own one yourself 
     you'd be fishing on a block of ice.

Kay digests that.

             NOLAN 
     I'm usually not a fan of letting 
     these guys off the hook... But this 
     one... Well. By this point I gotta 
     apologize. You were right. Seems we 
     had a crazy one in the batch after 
     all.

She tries not to wince at the word.

I/E. SAN QUENTIN STATE PRISON/EMPLOYEE EXIT - LATE AFTERNOON

Deb Stilson is handed her purse through a transaction drawer;
she's headed out for the day. She approaches her beat up 
Honda on the employee lot but stops at the sight of Kay 
waiting by her car.

             KAY
     You've still been visiting him. Do
     they know that?

For a moment, Deb doesn't know what to say.

             DEB
     Visiting who?

             KAY
     Don't lie to me Miss Stilson. I 
     know.

Kay sets a newspaper down on the hood of her car; it's the 
same paper we'd seen Deb reading when we met her- "Mining 
town protest closing mines."

CONTINUED:

             KAY 
     He said something about miners 
     today, and it made me realize that 
     someone had been sneaking him 
     newspapers.

Deb moves to speak, but her jaw quakes. Scared. She decides 
to come clean:

             DEB
     I just like to check on him every 
     once in a while - I just want to 
     make sure he's alright and he likes 
     to read the paper - I don't take 
     him anything else, I swear. I don't 
     tell him anything either. They'll 
     fire me Miss Margolis. Please. I 
     can't lose this job. 

             KAY
     You need to get help. He's still 
     got you around his finger.

             DEB
     No. No! I just told you-

But Kay is already headed away.

             DEB 
     Please! You're not gonna say 
     anything!? RIGHT!?

A panicked Deb follows after Kay who just gets into her car-

             DEB 
     Please!

Kay drives away, leaving a panicked Kay staring.

EXT. SAN QUENTIN VILLAGE - EARLY EVENING

Local and national news vans take up residential driveways.  

On lawns and curbs - cameramen set up, news anchors prep, two 
police officers direct incoming traffic. A family peers 
through their windows at the cyclone of activity outside 
their home. The entire thing has a circus feel to it.

PAN UP to-

San Quentin's plain boxy EXECUTION WING. 

INT. EXECUTION CHAMBER - EARLY EVENING

Where Kay sits in the ten-person viewing area designated for 
journalists and officials. Every seat is full - journalists 
clicking away at laptops. Again: circus feel.  

Kay looks uneasy and out-of-place.

The LA TIMES JOURNALIST beside her notices.

             LA TIMES JOURNALIST
     First execution, huh?
        (Kay nods)
     It's like a roller coaster, except 
     the car doesn't ever move and a few 
     minutes later the conductor tells 
     you to get out. You'll be fine. 

Moments later, the doors are closed - and two guards 
including Nolan roll Agustin 'Culebra' Sol on a gurney into 

THE EXECUTION CHAMBER.

Silence falls. 

INT. CONDEMNED UNIT - SAME

A bruised, handcuffed Samuel looks up from an infirmary bed 
where his arm has been bandaged.

FOUR ARMED GUARDS stand at the door, ready to take him away.

Samuel looks defeated, slumped, the fight in him now gone...

As one guard unlocks the cuffs and two others force him up.

INTERCUT THE EXECUTION CHAMBER

Nolan tightens the vinyl restraints on Culebra's gurney. The 
inmate's stare remains locked on the ceiling, remorseless. He 
nonetheless flinches when Nolan tightens the restraint 
holding down his right wrist. It's tied to the machine that's 
going to administer the chemicals that will stop his heart.

             NOLAN
     That feel okay?

Culebra nods, terse, a gangster till the end.

IN THE VIEWING CHAMBER, everyone including Kay stares.

It's a roller coaster alright.

EXT. CONDEMNED UNIT - SAME

Samuel - led toward a TRANSPORT BUS outside in similar vinyl 
restraints. His movement is lethargic; he tries not to cry.

             ARMED TRANSPORT GUARD
     Congrats. Looks like you drew the 
     winning number out.

Samuel throws him a look laced with desperation.

             SAMUEL
     If you only knew what's going to 
     happen to all of you...

Armed Guard throws his guard buddy a look, "This guy's nuts." 
Before they yank him up the stairs, into the bus-

CUT TO:

IN THE EXECUTION CHAMBER

Culebra has been left alone, restrained on the gurney and 
gazing at the ceiling. The soft beep of the lethal injection 
machine is his sole companion now. 

From the anteroom, the warden's voice through a speaker:

             WARDEN CONTINUED
     Would you like to say any last 
     words?

Culebra shakes his head, defiant. But if we looked closely, 
we'd notice that his breathing is just slightly quicker now. 
And if we could see the heart monitor outside, we'd see his 
heartbeat rising. It's fear.

And from one moment to the next, he's bawling. The lethal 
injection machine is triggered: the injection with the sodium 
pentothal empties, soon followed by the one with the bromide.

             CULEBRA
     I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...

He weeps like a child as the third syringe with the potassium 
chloride is triggered.

IN THE VIEWING ROOM- Everyone, including the LA Times 
journalist, watches in pin-drop silence.

IN THE CHAMBER- Culebra's denim pants grow wet as he urinates 
on himself.

CONTINUED:

ON Kay, has to look away.

INT. TRANSPORT BUS - SAME

The door to the CAGE holding Samuel is locked and checked by 
Armed Security Guard, who takes a seat facing him - knocks on 
the driver's wall to start the bus. Samuel KICKS the cage 
door over and over.

             ARMED TRANSPORT GUARD
     Calm down buddy. You're getting out 
     of jail. You should be happy.

Samuel slumps, helpless - he glances through the window as it 
starts away from San Quentin. One man weeping because he's 
dying, the other manic because he's not.

             SAMUEL
        (sotto)
     I'm sorry.

             ARMED TRANSPORT GUARD
     What's that?

             SAMUEL
     I'm sorry...for what has to happen 
     now.

WIDE

As the transport bus approaches the gates; it's waved through 
and leaves San Quentin behind.

INT. BUNGALOW HOME - NIGHT

It's pitch black as Kay enters her living room, flips the 
light switch on but the bulb POPS. "Shit." She pads through 
the darkness, calling out for -

             KAY
     Hon?

But slows when she hears Troy's voice leaking from the closed 
bathroom in their bedroom.

             TROY
     - Of course. At least you'll give 
     me something to look forward to.

Kay frowns, and follows the tiny sliver of light emanating 
from beneath the bathroom door.

CONTINUED:


             TROY 
     Have you ever seen me at anything 
     less than striking? 
        (laughs)
     Hey you said it first, not me. 

Suddenly Kay bumps into a chair; Troy's conversation CEASES.

             TROY
     Call you back.

Kay rushes back to the living room, opening and closing the 
door as if just entering - Just before Troy emerges from 
their bedroom. He's in the middle of putting on a tie.

             TROY 
     Hey babe.

             KAY
     Hey.

             TROY
     You just get in?

             KAY
     Yeah.
        (flips switch)
     I think the bulb's burnt out.

             TROY
     I'll get it changed. Gonna have to 
     be after I'm back.

             KAY
     Where are you going?

He hurries back to the bathroom.

             TROY
     I thought I told you, I'm on staff 
     tonight for Wyatt's reception at 
     the Four Seasons. 

             KAY
     No, you didn't.

He shuts the bathroom door, we hear rummaging from the 
bathroom as he yells out-

CONTINUED: ( 2)

             TROY
     Sorry, thought I did! Most of the 
     seats are gonna be there, so I 
     volunteered! I'm actually running a 
     little late!

She stares at the closed bathroom door. Long beat.

             KAY
     Who all is gonna be there!

             TROY CONTINUED
     Almost everyone! 

Kay thinks.

             KAY
     Including State Legislature?

The rummaging in the bathroom suddenly stops, as he pokes his 
head back out - 

             TROY
     Yeah...Why?

             KAY
     Including Governor Cayman?

Beat.

             TROY
     I think so. Why?

But Kay doesn't immediately answer. As if just deciding at 
this very moment that-

             KAY
     I'd like to go.

             TROY
     No, I can't.

He continues getting ready.

             KAY
     Why not? 

             TROY
     'Cause it's too last minute, you 
     should've asked me earlier. It's a 
     process to get someone through 
     security at these things.

CONTINUED: ( 3)

             KAY
     Well I just found out about it, 
     'cause you forgot to tell me. And 
     besides...I'm sure they expect 
     people to have a plus one at these 
     things.

             TROY
     I'm running late Kay. You can't 
     just throw this on me last minute 
     like this.

             KAY
        (snaps)
     -You can't bring your friggin'
     girlfriend to a work dinner? Since 
     when is that too much to ask?

Whoa. He pokes his head back out. From his expression, we can 
tell that this is an unusual reaction from her. Beat.

             TROY
     Let me ask. Okay?

INT. VOLVO (MOVING) - NIGHT

They drive in silence. Troy behind the wheel, trying to hide 
his annoyance.

             TROY
     ...How was work?

             KAY
     I saw my first execution today.

Finally he looks over. Softens.

             TROY
     Jesus. I'm sorry. You okay-

             KAY
     -What about you? How's everything 
     with your co-workers?

Strange thing to ask.

             TROY
     There something you wanna say? 
     'Cause we're not gonna get anywhere 
     if you're not just gonna say what's 
     on your mind.

CONTINUED:

She shakes her head. Glances out the window. The emerald palm 
trees and clean streets of Stanford flash past.

             TROY 
     Let's just try to have a good time, 
     okay?

They drive in silence.

             KAY
     Well ... If there's anything a hot 
     doctor girlfriend does for you... 
     is make you look good. 

A laugh escapes him. She cracks a smile.

             TROY
     Well look who's thinking highly of 
     herself right now!
        (looks her over)
     I'm not gonna lie you look hot as 
     all hell right now.

Indeed, she does.

             KAY
     I'm sorry about snapping earlier. 
     It's just been a stressful week.

             TROY
     Hey. I'm glad you did. 'Cause I'm 
     glad you're here.

He leans over. Lips meet halfway. All is right in their world 
again. Her content gaze goes to the window, but- A thought-

             KAY
     Let me ask you something. Are there 
     private lakes in Wisconsin?

INT. FOUR SEASONS HOTEL/BALLROOM SPACE - NIGHT

Red, white and blue balloons festoon the walls. Political 
banter and glad handing galore. Security wands every entrant 
at the door.

Find: Kay and Troy, mid-conversation with a white-haired 
DONOR COUPLE. 

             TROY
        (introducing-)
     My girlfriend, Kay. 

CONTINUED:

             TROY
     She's a psychiatrist with the 
     Department of Prisons. She helps 
     death row inmates with mental 
     issues.

             DONOR WIFE
     Dear Lord. How in the world is the 
     that?

             KAY
     Never a boring day. Go ahead and 
     interpret that however you want.
        (off laughter)
     Seriously, though, prison inmates 
     are one of the most overlooked 
     subsections of society, 'cause 
     people forget that they're still 
     part of society- 

Donor Husband throws Troy a fleeting but distinct look: good 
job on her. Kay was right: she makes him look good.

ANGLE ON THE BAR- Where a PRETTY FEMALE STAFFER throws Kay 
discreet glances from across the room. A male staffer sidles 
up beside her to order a drink, starts chatting her up.

ANGLE TROY AND KAY

As Troy excuses himself from the conversation.

             TROY
     You guys want anything else? Heard 
     the GOP actually sprung for good 
     scotch this year.

He leaves Kay alone with the donor couple - the wife still 
fascinated by Kay's occupation.

             DONOR WIFE
     So all these men are on death row?

             KAY
     All have been sentenced to die, 
     yes.

             DONOR WIFE
     What sort of things did they do?

             DONOR HUSBAND
     Honey that's enough.

CONTINUED: ( 2)

ANGLE ON THE BAR- Troy moves in beside the pretty staffer, 
shakes hands with the guy chatting her up and gives the woman 
a hug. Could be just friendly. Could be more. Tough to tell.

Kay watches it all from across the room. Can't help but 
stare, even as Fundraiser Wife keeps rattling.

             DONOR WIFE
     That's awful. Absolutely awful. I 
     had a nephew who went to prison 
     once.

             DONOR HUSBAND
     We don't need to get into all that.

             DONOR WIFE
     He's embarrassed. I keep telling 
     him, it's nothing to be embarrassed 
     about...

But Kay keeps throwing periodic glances at her boyfriend.

             KAY
     You're right. Everyone makes 
     mistakes.

Moments later, he arrives again with a glass of scotch.

             TROY
        (takes a sip)
     Um. Nope. Same cheap stuff.

Chatter from the south end grabs everyone's attention. 

In fact, the entire room seems to subtly shift focus. We soon 
see why: the governor of California has arrived.

             DONOR WIFE
     Excuse us for a moment.

And just like that, Donor Couple moves on to another couple 
closer in proximity to the governor's circle.

             KAY
        (jokey)
     Uh-oh. How are we gonna get in 
     there?

Troy shrugs, playing it off, but his attention is clearly on 
THE GROUP OF PEOPLE SURROUNDING GOVERNOR ALBERT CAYMAN. The 
mayor. Councilmen. Local journalists. It's like high school 
all over again, and the quarterback has just arrived. 

CONTINUED: ( 3)

We get our first glimpse of GOVERNOR CAYMAN: younger than we 
expected (late 30's), but pure polish. Think John Edwards 
sans scandal. He plays his entourage like a violin.

LATER

Kay and Troy converse with another couple. 

Like everyone else, they've managed to get a few degrees 
closer to the governor's circle. 

Kay spots the pretty staffer from earlier walking past.

             KAY 
     Who's that?

             TROY
     Who?

        (spots pretty staffer)
     Oh. Not sure.

Kay frowns. He's lying.

             GOVERNOR CAYMAN CONTINUED
     Tell them that I have no idea. I 
     plan for everything just in case, 
     and in the long run it always pays 
     off. If you quote me on that though 
     tell them I'd had a few when I said 
     it.

Laughter. The governor is only a few feet away now. Troy's 
posture changes; he stands a little straighter. 

Suddenly Donor Couple intercepts the governor.

             DONOR HUSBAND
     Albert!

             GOVERNOR CAYMAN
     Chuck!

Cayman embraces Donor Husband; a hug and peck for the wife. 
The couple beams. They've donated millions for this.

             DONOR HUSBAND
     Congrats on the Times article. 

             GOVERNOR CAYMAN
     You know everything don't you?

             DONOR HUSBAND
     My daughter is an editor there.

CONTINUED: ( 4)


             GOVERNOR CAYMAN
     How come I didn't know that?

             DONOR HUSBAND
     She forwarded me an advanced copy. 
     I'm glad the Hurricane Debby thing 
     if finally coming to light. You 
     deserve it.

             GOVERNOR CAYMAN
     Hey- I got lucky. Just don't tell 
     her I admitted that.

Donor Husband laughs.

ANGLE ON KAY AND TROY

             KAY
        (whispers)
     What's the Hurricane Debby thing?

             TROY
     He got a lot of flack last year for 
     investing thirty million dollars 
     from the budget in coast 
     restoration. People thought it was 
     a giant waste of money, especially 
     in this economy. Three months 
     later, Hurricane Debby hits and it 
     looks like it's saved the State 
     eighty million dollars. Guess 
     they're gonna do an article about 
     it.

Kay throws Cayman a dubious look.

             KAY
     He's really young.

             TROY
     Youngest governor in the history of 
     the state.

Cayman moves onto a power circle beside them, more hugs and 
greetings. This guy is the penultimate showman.

Troy is trying to look like he's not merely waiting for the 
governor to move past, but he's clearly just waiting for the 
governor to move past. Suddenly Cayman breaks away from his 
group, and moves right past them                      - Troy looks like he wants 
to say something but can't muster the courage. 

CONTINUED: ( 5)

             KAY
     Governor Cayman!

A startled Troy looks over at Kay "What-the-heck-are-you-
doing?" Cayman stops at the sight of the attractive  woman 
who just called his name. He approaches, sans entourage, hand 
extended- his million dollar smile always on:

             GOVERNOR CAYMAN
     Have we met?

             TROY
        (cutting in)
     I work on Councilman Wyatt's staff. 

They all shake hands. 

             GOVERNOR CAYMAN
     And this is?

Troy realizes that he forgot to introduce Kay.

             TROY
     Oh, my girlfriend- She's uh, she's 
     a psychiatrist with the Department 
     of Prisons. She helps death row 
     inmates with mental issues.

Cayman's got that piercing stare that makes you feel like 
you're the only person in the room, and right now it's 
trained on Kay. She can't help but blush.

             KAY
     Kay. Big supporter of yours
     governor.

             GOVERNOR CAYMAN
     I've only ever met one other Kay in 
     my life.

             KAY
     Your professor. In Germany. When 
     you went abroad sophomore year at 
     Princeton.

Troy gives Kay a sidelong glance. She did research on him?

             GOVERNOR CAYMAN
     They said my book sold seven 
     copies. At least I know where one 
     of them went.

Laughter.

CONTINUED: ( 6)

             TROY
     We went abroad too. Spent a year in 
     India together.

             GOVERNOR CAYMAN
        (in perfect subtitled 
         Punjabi)
     [Well I can safely say I'm a fan of 
     you both already.]
        (off their look)
     I took a little detour to India as 
     well. I left that part out of the 
     book. Was gonna leave it for the 
     follow-up but my publishers say the 
     first one needs to sell more first.
        (off laughter, to Troy)
     Good job with this one. I wish I 
     had time to get to know you two a 
     bit more, but I'm sure we'll meet 
     again. I'll ask Joe about you. 

And like that, he turns to leave. Kay watches him walk away, 
possibly forever. Beat. She takes a leap-of-faith:

             KAY
     What do you think about Hawaii?

Cayman stops on a dime. He pivots, turns and marches back to 
Kay. His entourage looks over confused. Troy is also looking 
over at his girlfriend, at a loss. What is she doing?

             GOVERNOR CAYMAN
     That's a strange thing to ask, 
     Miss...
        (reads name tag)
     Margolis. And you don't seem too 
     strange to me. So why would you ask
     that?

             KAY
     I just- I was wondering if you 
     thought there would be any 
     advantages to moving something like 
     a naval base-

             GOVERNOR CAYMAN
     Where did you say you worked again?

Governor's entourage has fallen silent around them. 

             KAY
     Federal Bureau of Prisons.

CONTINUED: ( 7)

             GOVERNOR CAYMAN
     And what in my proposals, policies 
     or views screams Hawaii to you? 

Kay feels the pressure of the eyes around her. What has she 
gotten herself into? Troy looks stiff as a board.

             KAY
     It was just a question-

             GOVERNOR CAYMAN
     Tied to my private holdings there, 
     I know. You're trying to antagonize 
     me, or lure me into a statement-

             KAY
     No! Not at all-

             GOVERNOR CAYMAN
     Yes, you are. And yes, my wife's 
     family owns construction businesses 
     there. But I think everyone already 
     knows that. And yes, I have 
     directed government business there 
     when I thought it was the best 
     place for it...but never, and feel 
     free to quote this if you'd like: 
     never have I used my position in 
     the United States government to put 
     a dollar in my pocket. I'm wealthy 
     enough already. I don't need to.
        (then)
     It was great meeting you both.

He walks away, leaving Kay with nothing to say. Troy is beet-
red with embarrassment.

             TROY
     Are you insane?

INT. VOLVO (MOVING) - NIGHT

Troy at the wheel, furious. Kay looks like she wants to crawl 
into herself.

             TROY
     You're not gonna answer now?

             KAY
     I messed up, okay? I had no idea 
     that his wife's family owned 
     companies in Hawaii.

CONTINUED:

             TROY
     What, your prison guru failed to 
     mention that? Or that he's been 
     criticized about it for years? 
     'Cause you seem to have done a lot 
     of research on him otherwise!
        (then)
     You promised me, you swore to me 
     that you wouldn't bring your work 
     into our lives-

             KAY
     This had nothing to do with that-

             TROY
     You think I don't know where all 
     this is coming from? It was cute at 
     first but your little obsession is
     making you look stupid now. And now 
     you've made me look like an idiot
     in front of the people I work with.

             KAY
     I said I'm sorry.

             TROY
     How is that gonna make anything 
     alright?!

Kay looks at Troy in shock. We can tell that she's never seen 
him this angry.

             KAY
     ...I'm sorry. I'll send a letter 
     tomorrow apologizing...

As he pulls into their drive, but doesn't turn the car off. 

             TROY
     I'm gonna spend the night at 
     Eric's.

She realizes that it's not worth arguing, so she gets out...

             TROY 
     By the way.
        (she stops)
     Those stories about the nuclear 
     submarine and Myanmar and China and 
     all that. I saw it on some 
     Discovery Channel show this 
     morning. I meant to tell you. I 
     left it on the DVR.

CONTINUED: ( 2)

             TROY
        (then)
     You need to open your eyes and see 
     the obvious, or that job's gonna
     cost you more than me.

She watches the car back up and drive away. 

INT. BUNGALOW HOME/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Curled up on the couch, speechless, she watches

THE TV- Where a cheaply-made cable series called End of the 
World (think Conspiracy Theory on TruTV) plays, hosted by the 
professorial-looking HOST:

             HOST
     ...if say, Burma, as it was known 
     back then, attacked the coast of 
     Hawaii instead of Japan. Today, 
     China would immediately mobilize an 
     attack which could cause a chain of 
     events that could lead to mass 
     nuclear war-

She clicks the TV off. Left alone in the dark. Staring into 
the nothing.

Suddenly she HURLS the remote control against the wall, 
breaking it to pieces.

Bzzt. Bzzt. It's coming from her purse. She glances at her 
watch (it's almost 2 am) as she digs out her vibrating cell.  
Reacts when she sees who the caller is, quickly answers- 

             KAY
     Nolan?

Her face falls as she listens.

             KAY 
     I'm leaving now.

INT. SAN QUENTIN STATE PRISON/CONDEMNED UNIT - NIGHT

She strides in-step beside Nolan.  

TWO NIGHT GUARDS in Receiving exchange loaded looks with 
Nolan as he marches past. Something big has just gone down.

             KAY
     Is the guard gonna be okay?

CONTINUED:

             NOLAN
     He might live.

They move past the PLEXIGLAS CELLS of death row housing - 
various inmates are awake and on their feet (including 
Charles Beresford). Watching her move past, more excited than 
concerned. This is an event for them.

             NOLAN 
     Mayor's sending someone to inspect 
     safety on the premises now. This is 
     going to make me look very bad. 

And now, they reach -

SAMUEL'S CELL, 

Where Samuel sits slumped on his cot, head hanging. His
jumpsuit is covered in blood. 

             NOLAN 
     He tried to commit suicide with a 
     piece of rebar when they caught 
     him. - They'll be here in ten. 
     Please make it count.

             KAY
        (as Nolan heads away)
     Why are you helping him?

Nolan turns.

             NOLAN
     I'm not. I need to know how he got 
     out of that bus, which was 
     completely secure and had two armed 
     guards, and he's made it clear that 
     he won't talk to anyone but you. So 
     you know what you need to do.

Nolan exists. She and Samuel are left alone.

For a moment Kay doesn't move. She has to find the energy to 
take a step forward, moves the voice port aside.

             KAY
     Samuel.
        (he still doesn't move)
     Samuel.

Slowly, his head tilts up. In this phosphorescent light, his 
skin looks even more balmy than it did before; that and his 
bloodshot eyes give him an altogether vampiric look. 

CONTINUED: ( 2)

             KAY 
     What did you do?

Beat. 

             SAMUEL
     I'm sure they already told you.

             KAY
     ...Why?
        (no answer)
     The guard may never walk again.

Suddenly Samuel leaps out of bed and suddenly bangs his palms
against the Plexiglass, making her jump. 

             SAMUEL
     I told you, to let me die! You 
     stupid! Bitch!

Kay gapes. This is a totally different Samuel than we've ever 
seen.  He laughs.

             SAMUEL 
     But you know what - I fucked up. It 
     was my bad. I was so good that you 
     started to believe that I believed 
     what I was saying.
        (laughs)
     Guy tries to drive a bitch away, 
     and the bitch ends up falling in 
     love. Ain't that how it always is.

Kay stares speechless. 

             SAMUEL 
     I told you we were good actors, 
     doctor, and I'm Marlon fuckin'
     Brando up in here.

             KAY
     Why did you call me...

             SAMUEL
     -Because I wanted you to see what 
     you'd done. You wanna know if I 
     killed those construction workers? 
     I blew their heads off. Look at the 
     evidence. I needed money and I'd 
     heard the hotel had a safe. You 
     wanted the truth? There it is. And 
     to be honest: I enjoyed it.

CONTINUED: ( 3)

Kay studies his eyes for truth.

             KAY
     So why make everything up. About 
     the governor. About your state of 
     mind.

             SAMUEL
     ... Because I didn't wanna die. 
     Because I was scared. Because even 
     a nut house sounded better than 
     this. I'm not scared anymore.

Kay's eyes grow wet. She was played for a fool.

             KAY
     ...How do I know... How do I know 
     that you're not telling me what you 
     think I need to hear to let your 
     execution pass...

             SAMUEL
     Because if I were a god...what the 
     hell would I be doing behind bars?

Beat. As it now becomes painfully obvious: he wouldn't be.

             KAY
     ...Maybe he caught you, like you 
     said - and maybe you think that 
     being here is the best way- 

             SAMUEL
     -I wanted to see if I could get 
     someone as smart and educated as 
     you to eat my shit. Unfortunately 
     it backfired one me.

Kay wipes a single tear. Because maybe...just maybe...a tiny 
part of her wanted to believe.

             SAMUEL 
     I'm sorry doctor...

             KAY
     Shuttup. Just...shuttup. - I was 
     stupid enough to actually check the 
     news this morning, if you can 
     believe that.
        (he reacts)
     I actually expected to see 
     something about that navy base.

CONTINUED: ( 4)

And his confusion turns into alarm.

             KAY 
     And not because I think you can see 
     the future, because I've always 
     known that's bullshit- but because 
     you're good at predicting the 
     obvious somehow.

             SAMUEL
     ...What are you talking about? 

Kay hears footsteps approaching and glances over. 

             SAMUEL 
     Did you have any contact with 
     Cayman since we spoke? Did you 
     mention anything I said? 
        (realization dawns)
     If you did, he must've changed his 
     plan. He can't do what he was 
     planning anymore because he knows
     you know now- !

             KAY
     That's what I thought.

He stiffens, caught in his lie.

             KAY 
     You've never told me anything you 
     didn't think was true.

The INSPECTORS FROM THE MAYOR'S OFFICE approach with Nolan. 
She doesn't have much time.

             KAY 
     How did you get out of the bus?
     They need to know.
        (off silence)
     I'm not gonna change the verdict, 
     Samuel. If that's what you want, 
     I'm gonna let you die. I just need
     to know how you managed to get the 
     key from the guard.

             SAMUEL
     ...Was there really no break-in at 
     the naval base?

She shakes her head.

CONTINUED: ( 5)

             KAY
     You were wrong.

Samuel nods, just once, as if accepting, for the very first 
time ever, that he might actually be insane.

             SAMUEL
     I convinced him to hand me the key.
     Then I spun the bus over and bashed 
     his head to the ground till he 
     couldn't move any more.

Kay takes a long final look at him, then backs away... turns 
and scurries off as the State inspectors arrive... 

Nolan throws her a quick questioning look, "Did you get the 
info?" But she evades it and hurries out the door - can't 
stand to be there anymore...

             SAMUEL
     I remember my very last attempt on 
     his life.

EXT. MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE COMPOUND/BEIJING - 1974

A MAN'S BACK

Sits hunched over a giant metal desk. See the austere sprawl 
and countless boxy cars of West Beijing through the window. 
Circa 1974.

             SAMUEL
     It was the height of the Cold War.

CAMERA SLOWLY ROTATES TO REVEAL- A small, pudgy Chinese 
DEFENSE MINISTER, scribbling furiously while muttering what 
sounds like an ancient language under his breath.

             SAMUEL
     He was a high-ranking Defense 
     Minister in the People's Liberation 
     Army with a direct line to then-
     party leader Mao Zedong ... who, 
     though not admitted, I believe was 
     a Pilocyte as well.

The chubby Defense Minister is writing furiously in                                    English
(catch a glimpse, "invest in these stocks...") - when a BANG 
on the door makes him suddenly look up. He immediately folds 
the paper and slides it into an envelope addressed to- MISS 
MARY ELISE CAYMAN, PO BOX 76599, SAINT LOUIS, MISSOURI. Sets 
a stamp on the envelope and rises as-

CONTINUED:

             CHINESE DEFENSE MINISTER
        (in subtitled Chinese)
     Come in. 

A thin Chinese soldier sticks his head in- Defense Minister 
nods- "Show them in." And points out the recently-stamped 
LETTER he just set in his delivery box to be sent out.

             SAMUEL
     I was a diplomat with the French 
     government-

AS A RETINUE OF WELL-DRESSED FRENCH POLITICIANS are led in by 
the Chinese soldier.

             SAMUEL
     -born to a poor Algerian family in 
     Auvergne but had worked my way into 
     the government via a strong 
     proficiency for languages and 
     dialects, namely those of China. 
     The truth is that I spoke thousands 
     of languages from thousands of 
     lives, as did he.

Defense Minister shakes hands with the politicians, amiable. 
But freezes when he sees- THEIR TRANSLATOR: a dark French-
Algerian diplomat who HOLDS STARES with Defense Minister. It 
is a loaded stare. Defense Minister pastes on a smile, shakes 
his hand, and-

They sit to begin their meeting: Translator translates 
perfectly, Defense Minister plays his role of host well. And 
though he addresses the politicians, his GAZE is directed 
mostly on Translator.

             SAMUEL
     He knew that I had come for him 
     from across the world. I had gauged 
     what had gone wrong the last time 
     around, when he'd had me murdered 
     in France, and played things 
     perfectly to be able to show up at 
     his doorstep this time-

Chinese Defense Minister looks a tad bit paranoid, glancing 
around at his room as if it were suddenly alien to him.

             SAMUEL
     -With a gun hidden behind an old
     pipe in the wall-


CONTINUED: ( 2)

PUSH IN ON- A WALL, PAST BEAMS AND OLD BRICK, WHERE WE SEE: A 
World War I era Type 26 REVOLVER taped to a rusty pipe.

             SAMUEL
     -Which I, as a Japanese laborer 
     forty years earlier, had planted 
     during the building's construction 
     for this very moment in 1974.

PULL BACK OUT TO- THE MEETING. As the men rise, say their 
good-byes, and once again shake hands. When Defense Minister 
gets to Translator, he SHAKES HANDS JUST A BIT HARDER THAN 
NECESSARY, HOLDS STARES A BIT LONGER THAN CUSTOMARY.

             SAMUEL
     He knew that I had check-mated him 
     this time around. That I had most 
     likely covered every possible 
     escape route he could now plan-

INT. NOLAN'S OFFICE - EARLY MORNING

Kay sits alone in Nolan's closed office - LISTENING TO 
SAMUEL'S VOICE SPILLING FROM HER VOICE RECORDER (WHICH IS THE 
SOURCE OF THE NARRATION WE'VE BEEN HEARING) -

             SAMUEL
     -Except for one-

When suddenly the door opens and Nolan enters from his 
meeting with the inspectors. Kay SHUTS THE RECORDER OFF and 
rises, SLIDES IT INTO HER VALISE.

             NOLAN
     Did he tell you how he did it?

             KAY
     He said that he convinced the guard 
     to give him the key. You think he's 
     lying?

Nolan looks off, thinking.

             NOLAN
     ...I don't know. The guard's in a 
     coma so we can't ask him. The guard 
     driving doesn't remember them 
     chatting though, and they were comm
     linked. We won't know til he wakes 
     up. If he wakes up.
        (spots something outside)
     I gotta go.

CONTINUED:

             KAY
     What's next? For Samuel?

Nolan looks back at Kay, surprised.

             NOLAN
     Well, doctor, that's up to you. 
     Your review was the reason he was 
     being sent away to begin with. This 
     can be considered grounds for a new 
     review.
        (off her look)
     So you tell me. You think he's 
     really insane? Or was he aware of 
     what he was doing when he put that 
     guard in intensive care?

Kay glances out the window on the door- AT THE INSPECTOR 
GRILLING A SILENT SAMUEL ACROSS THE CONDEMNED WARD.

             NOLAN 
     Make your decision in the next few 
     hours. I need to get back to them.
        (Kay whispers something 
         under her breath)
     What's what?

Kay speaks louder now:

             KAY
     ...He knew what he was doing. 
        (off Nolan's surprised 
         look)
     He told me that he knew what he was 
     doing when he killed those 
     construction workers. He knew what 
     he was doing when he attacked the 
     guard in the bus.

             NOLAN
     That your decision?
        (Kay nods)
     Okay then. I'll get that over to 
     the Governor's office, and the 
     execution Thursday will continue as 
     previously planned. 

Beat.

Nolan moves to head out, but stops at the door. Turns.

CONTINUED: ( 2)

             NOLAN 
     Listen... Given the unusual 
     circumstances of this one, you can 
     sit this one out-

             KAY
     No. I'll be there.
        (off his look)
     Why should this be different than 
     any other, right?

Kay tries to put on a brave smile.

INT. TROY'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY

She drives Troy's Wrangler back to Palo Alto (he took off 
with her Volvo) - eyes on the road. We HEAR SAMUEL'S VOICE 
FROM THE VOICE RECORDER ON THE PASSENGER SEAT - 

             SAMUEL
     -Except for one. He threw me for a 
     loop with his escape; I gotta give 
     him credit for that-

INT. MINISTRY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE COMPOUND/BEIJING - 1974

[NARRATION CONTINUES WHERE WE LEFT OFF]

...As an ashen-faced Chinese Defense Minister watches 
Translator head off with the diplomats... Knows that he's 
been beaten in this life...

MOMENTS LATER

Defense Minister is TRASHING HIS OFFICE, tearing pieces of 
the floorboards and walls. He finds the revolver hidden 
behind a hole in the wall, curses at himself.

             SAMUEL
     - performing an old Pilocyte trick 
     I had to later implement myself.

Exhausted, he finally looks up, an idea forming.

EXT. A PLAIN APARTMENT IN WEST BEIJING - 1974

He stands on the LEDGE of his tiny SPARTAN high-rise, gazes 
at the curled tendrils of the Yangtze River in the distance.

CONTINUED:

             SAMUEL
     He did the math, of when technology 
     was going to hit the pinnacle of 
     potential mass destruction - the 
     21st century - where he was going 
     to be born and who he could 
     potentially be if he played his 
     cards right...

The Defense Minister sucks a breath...

And steps off the ledge to his death.

             SAMUEL
     And he must've figured that 
     President of the United States 
     could be a good place to be in 
     sixty years.

EXT. BUNGALOW HOME - DAY

The old Wrangler sits parked on the drive.

IN THE CAR, Kay finishes listening:

             SAMUEL
     And I knew that I had to follow him 
     myself.

FLASH INSERT- 1974

CLOSE ON FRENCH DIPLOMAT'S FACE - deep in thought and staring 
into nothing. Suddenly he sticks the barrel of a revolver 
into his mouth (no fear whatsoever) and-

BAM!

BACK TO SCENE

We don't know how long she's been parked outside listening to 
the tape, but she rewinds again and replays:

             SAMUEL
     And I knew that I had to follow him 
     myself.

The Volvo pulls up beside her.

INT. BUNGALOW HOME/BEDROOM - DAY

Troy packs a suitcase as Kay watches from the door.

CONTINUED:

             TROY
     I just need more time to do some 
     thinking. About this. About 
     everything.

Her silence makes him look over. She looks lost in thought.

             KAY
     Are you seeing someone else?

             TROY
     Don't try to turn this around on me-

             KAY
     Look. I don't care if you move out. 
     In fact I think you need to... But 
     please, answer the question: is 
     there someone else?

He holds her look, eyes flick to the left.

             TROY
     No.

But her gaze doesn't let go of his. 

             TROY 
     ...Yes.

Breath leaves Kay's lungs.

             TROY 
     You can keep everything.

             KAY
     Less than a week?
        (off his silence)
     Yes, or no?
Beat.

             TROY
     Yes. I'm sorry.

Meaning after she met Samuel.

She nods, accepting this.

             KAY
     I'll leave your stuff outside 
     tomorrow. 

She heads off, but turns and marches back into the room- 

CONTINUED: ( 2)

             KAY 
     You can keep everything, but I'm 
     gonna cash out our air miles.

             TROY
     What?

             KAY
     I'm taking a trip.

INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - DAY

Kay sits tucked away in coach, illuminated by the 
incandescent dome of an overhead light - flipping through 
various INTERNET PRINTOUTS. Glimpses of articles about a 
reclusive Hungarian billionaire named "Fyodor Gyenes."

             KAY CONTINUED
     There's only one private lake in 
     the entire state of Wisconsin, and 
     it's owned by a reclusive 
     billionaire from Hungary. You think 
     that's a coincidence?

INT. A TAXI CAB - MOVING

Kay's face- pressed against a frosty cab window- taking in 
the snow-capped sights of Madison, Wisconsin.

DISSOLVE TO...

The cab winds into a SPRAWLING REDBRICK DRIVE, approaches a 
pair of ornate wrought-iron gates. A LAKESIDE ESTATE: ranch-
style mansion covered in frost.

             CAB DRIVER
     When is your appointment?

Kay hesitates; it makes the cabbie glance up from his 
rearview, realizing that...

             KAY
     I'm just gonna wait for him out 
     here.

Cabbie shakes his head in disbelief. 

             CAB DRIVER
     It's five degrees out there.  

             KAY
     Keep the heat on. I'll pay.
        (then)

CONTINUED:

             KAY
     If he sees a woman freezing to 
     death outside, he'll have to let me 
     in. Right?

Kay notices the various SECURITY CAMERAS around the perimeter 
of the estate.

Suddenly: BZZZT. The gate groans open, startling them. A 
SPEAKER BOX below a camera by the gate CACKLES TO LIFE.

             STATIC-Y VOICE
     Dr. Margolis?

Kay and Cabbie exchange surprised looks.

             STATIC-Y VOICE (SPEAKER BOX) 
     Dr. Gyenes will see you now. Please 
     pull up to the south foyer.

(pronounced "Gaines")

INT. GYENES ESTATE - DAY

A gleaming marble waiting room with a single Jasper Johns 
sculpture (price: approximately $10M). 

Kay takes in the minimalist decorations of the extravagant 
space, notices the myriad DOME CAMERAS stationed around the 
house. They're everywhere.

             SECRETARY
     Doctor.

She whirls; a fastidious SECRETARY at the door. We recognize 
her as static-y voice from the call box... and she's taking 
Kay in with a hint of disdain. 

MOMENTS LATER...

She leads Kay down a hall (spot yet another set of cameras). 

             KAY
     Do you mind me asking why all the 
     cameras? You would think that five 
     or six would be enough, right?

Secretary ignores the joke as they approach a STUDY with a 
call box, and one final Lytro camera.

             SECRETARY
     Stand here, please.

CONTINUED:

Kay stands in front of the door, hears the camera whir 
several times. A moment later- CLICK. The door opens.

             SECRETARY 
     Next time, please don't come 
     without an appointment.

INT. GYENES STUDY - MOMENTS LATER

DR. FYODOR GYENES (a spry 60's) shakes snow off his work 
boots beside a hearth fireplace, his back to her. He 
brightens when he turns and sees her.  

             DR. FYODOR GYENES
     Dr. Margolis.

Takes her hand; a friendly, grandfatherly old man. She spots 
the GOLD CRUCIFIX around his neck. 

             DR. FYODOR GYENES 
     Before you ask, I did receive your 
     messages. You left quite a few. I 
     had a feeling that I wasn't going 
     to be able to stop you from coming.

             KAY
     Why didn't you respond?

             DR. FYODOR GYENES
     Because you mentioned Samuel
     Desmet, and I want nothing to have 
     to do with him any more.

             KAY
     How do you two know each other?

             DR. FYODOR GYENES
     He tried to have me killed.
        (looks her up and down)
     What size are you? 

EXT. LAKESIDE PIER - DAY

Despite her furred parka, Kay can't help but shiver 
uncontrollably as she follows Dr. Gyenes down a LITTLE WOODEN 
PIER that stretches out to 

A HALF-FROZEN LAKE 

He dumps a fishing reel onto the little ROWBOAT;                  she halts at the sight of the SHOTGUN wrapped in a blanket in the boat-

CONTINUED:

As he steps in and turns to help her on. She hesitates, but 
hides her fear and gives him her hand.

IN THE LAKE, MOMENTS LATER

The boat bobs in the middle of the half-frozen lake. He picks 
up the shotgun. 

             DR. FYODOR GYENES
     To the fish, it's as if it were 
     still summertime down there. They 
     have no idea what the world is like 
     above the surface.

             KAY
     He told me that you were Jesus 
     Christ.

BOOM! Gyenes blasts a HOLE into a frozen section of the lake, 
startling her. He drops a weighted fishing line through.

             DR. FYODOR GYENES
     And you believe him?

             KAY
     I don't know what to believe.

             DR. FYODOR GYENES
     What exactly did Samuel tell you 
     about me?

CUT TO:

EXT. GALILEE - 13 A.D.

A local BURNISHED-SKIN BOY in a coarse tunic, watches local 
Israeli craftsmen work wood with chisels and lathes. We're in 
the holy city of Galilee. Circa 13 A.D.

His name is YESHUA.

             KAY
     When you turned thirteen...you got 
     your memories back.

ON Yeshua - staring into nothing, disregarding his work. As 
if in a trance. A nearby craftsman whispers to the boy's 
father, Joseph, who signals, "Let the boy be."

CLOSE ON YESHUA'S FACE- Staring into thin air.

CONTINUED:

             KAY 
     And you saw a future plagued by 
     endless war and suffering.

BACK TO:

DR. GYENES

Expressionless. Cradling the shotgun.

She hesitates.

             DR. FYODOR GYENES
     Go on. It's an interesting story.

             KAY
     It was a world that needed order, 
     you thought.

EXT. GALILEE - VARIOUS

Young Yeshua- in a synagogue, discussing matters of religion 
with local rabbis. The older men appear impressed/amused by 
the boy's sudden intelligence. [Note: these scenes should all 
correlate with well-known scenes from the Bible]

             KAY
     So you devised a plan- one which 
     had already taken pair of lifetimes 
     to set up.

CUT TO AN OLDER YESHUA (and we'll now refer to him as JESUS,
as he'll come to be known by Western civilization)-  
surrounded by FOLLOWERS beside a LAKE- He wades in- And- 

CAMERA SINKS- INTO THE LAKE- PAST THE FISH, THROUGH THE 
GROUND, PAST LAYERS OF SEDENTARY ROCK, AND STOPS AT-

CORRODING CLAY POTS: MUST'VE BEEN SET HERE A COUPLE HUNDRED 
YEARS AGO, BEFORE THIS WAS EVEN A LAKE. CAUSE THEY'RE 
DISSOLVING, AND THE WINE INSIDE IS BEGINNING TO TENDRIL UP TO-

THE SURFACE,

Where an older Jesus, surrounded by even more followers, 
stands surrounded by a lake of water becoming wine.

Followers fall to their knees at the "miracle."

             KAY CONTINUED 
     And one more life to set it into 
     motion.

CONTINUED:

CUT TO JESUS, CRUCIFIED.

Followers in tears gaze up at him as if he were a god.

BACK TO SCENE

A stone-faced Dr. Gyenes listens silently. Impossible to tell 
what he's thinking.

             KAY 
     You started a religion because you 
     thought that it would help the 
     world. But since then, the world 
     has still had wars and suffering, 
     sometimes even because of the 
     religion.

             DR. FYODOR GYENES
     It would have been worse otherwise.

Was that a slip? 

Beat. His hands go to the crucifix round his neck.

             DR. FYODOR GYENES 
     As you know from having done 
     research on me I'm sure, I am a 
     devout Christian. 

             KAY
     I know. You've donated millions to 
     churches around the world.

             DR. FYODOR GYENES
     So why would I be worshiping 
     myself? That would be a hell of an 
     ego, wouldn't it?

Dr. Gyenes laughs.

             DR. FYODOR GYENES 
     I believe that all religions based 
     on the mores of helping your fellow 
     man - if followed as they are meant 
     to be, make the world a better 
     place. Yes, that is true.
        (lets that settle)
     I am not Jesus Christ reincarnated, 
     Dr. Margolis. I am not a 
     "Pilocyte," as Samuel called them, 
     because Pilocytes do not exist. 

CONTINUED: ( 2)

             DR. FYOD OR G YENES (CON T’D)
     Everything that Samuel has told you 
     is a very convincing fabrication of 
     his mind.

And Dr. Gyenes sighs, ashamed to admit that...

             DR. FYODOR GYENES 
     At one point, he even had me 
     considering the validity of his 
     theories myself. I was his 
     philosophy professor years ago. We 
     used to have these conversations 
     about time and existence and the 
     meaning of life, sometimes on this 
     very boat, and I enjoyed his 
     company quite a bit. Then one day, 
     he finds out that I contributed to 
     Albert Cayman's political campaign, 
     and a man shows up at my doorstep 
     and sticks a knife in my gut. 
        (off Kay's shock)
     The man was a member of what I 
     later learned was a cult started by 
     Samuel, who believed that I had 
     started an allegiance with his arch 
     nemesis Shiva in trying to destroy 
     the world. 

Lets that settle.

             DR. FYODOR GYENES 
     Look. I will prove to you beyond 
     the shadow of a doubt that Samuel's 
     religion is nonsense, I just need 
     you to promise that you'll never 
     speak of what you're about to see. 
     Can you do that?

She nods. Suddenly, the line on his fishing rod goes taught;
Dr. Gyenes' face immediately brightens - he reels in a 
flopping walleye, drops it into a small cooler and BASHES its 
head with a small mallet.

             DR. FYODOR GYENES 
     Another one sees the light of the 
     world above.

INT. A PRIVATE ROOM IN THE GYENES ESTATE - DAY

A METAL TABLET ENCLOSED IN A BULLETPROOF PLEXIGLAS CUBE

CONTINUED:

Kay approaches the enclosed case as Dr. Gyenes watches from 
the door. The entire wall is lined with SEVEN OF THESE 
TABLETS IN ENCLOSED SECURITY GLASS.

The room seems to exist solely for housing these artifacts.

             DR. FYODOR GYENES
     About eight years ago, these were
     found in an excavation I funded in 
     the Middle East.

ANGLE- Kay's REFLECTION on the glass, staring at 

THE TABLET 

Shiny. Steel. Two feet by three. Gouged with hieroglyphics-
like characters. Metal versions of the Ten Commandments.

             DR. FYODOR GYENES 
     As you know...the deeper you dig in 
     an excavation, the older the 
     artifacts one finds. You get past 
     four hundred meters, that's two, 
     three hundred thousand years of 
     history. We found these steel 
     tablets more than six hundred 
     meters below the surface of the 
     earth. 

He lets that settle, as if expecting some sort of reaction.

             KAY
     They've found plenty of metal 
     artifacts that old, no?

             DR. FYODOR GYENES
     Yes, but steel isn't just a metal 
     Dr. Margolis, it's an alloy, and
     alloys don't occur in nature, 
     they're made in a laboratory. And
     we were supposedly still living in 
     caves three hundred thousand years 
     ago. We hired a team of linguists 
     to try and translate them, and when 
     they finally managed to crack 
     one... They read about the rise of 
     the Hittite, the Roman, the Mongol 
     and the Ottoman empires more than 
     two-hundred thousand years in the 
     future.

Kay doesn't know how to react.

             KAY
     How come I've never heard about 
     these?

             DR. FYODOR GYENES
     Cuz we kept them private. Do you 
     know that when you find an 
     artifact, a vase, a clay pot, 
     anything of value, you can sell it 
     to any reputable museum for about 
     ten thousand dollars U.S.? But- if 
     that same artifact has any writing 
     on it, even a few words... the 
     price goes up tenfold. How much do 
     you think these would be worth if 
     the world knew about them?

             KAY
     I'd say they're priceless.

             DR. FYODOR GYENES
     They're worth the current price of 
     five pounds of steel. They're fake, 
     Doctor Margolis. An art forger 
     stepped forward after we found some 
     inconsistencies in the way the 
     markings were made. It was a very 
     clever fabrication, but a 
     fabrication nonetheless. We found 
     all this out last year.

She lets that settle.

             KAY
     Does Samuel know that?

             DR. FYODOR GYENES
     No. He doesn't. I made the mistake 
     of bringing Samuel into this room
     ten years ago, before we knew all 
     this. And I believe this is what
     triggered his psychosis. The future 
     and the past coexisting, ancient 
     people with knowledge of 
     technology, time travel ... gods on 
     earth and all that.
        (studies her for a 
         reaction)

CONTINUED: ( 3)

             DR. FYOD OR G YENES (CON T'D)
     Samuel will tell you that Albert 
     Cayman, myself and others around 
     the world are gods who want to end 
     it because we have "lived so many 
     times," that we want to stop being 
     re-born. But I am telling you that 
     he saw these things- something he 
     could not comprehend- and it drove 
     him over the edge.
        (then)
     He's scheduled to die tomorrow and 
     finally be at rest. That's what he 
     needs doctor. If you have any heart 
     in that body of yours, you'll let 
     him.

INT. EXECUTION CHAMBER/VIEWING AREA - NIGHT

In the viewing area, Kay sits alone. She's hours early.

Someone takes a seat next to her. It's Nolan.

             NOLAN
     You okay?
        (she nods)
     If it makes you feel any better, 
     you've lasted longer than I thought 
     you would. What are we at, day 
     five? 

She cracks a smile.

             NOLAN 
     Kinda sad to see him go. Between 
     us. He's nothing if not 
     interesting.

Kay stares at her feet, in thought.

             KAY
     Think I can talk to him for a few 
     minutes before?

             NOLAN
     It's not protocol. I'm sorry.

She nods, accepting this.

             KAY
     Did you figure out how he got out 
     of that bus? He telling the truth?

             NOLAN
     We're still analyzing the tape. 
     Guard's still in a coma but it 
     looks like he's gonna make it. 
     We'll get the full story when he's 
     better to talk. Feel free to swing 
     by the office to check out the 
     footage if you want. 

He rises to leave, but the sight of her sitting alone in the 
empty viewing chamber softens him.

             NOLAN 
     Two minutes. If you promise not to 
     tell.

INT. SAN QUENTIN STATE PRISON/CONDEMNED UNIT - DAY

Two guards open Samuel's cell door and he rises from his cot. 
We might notice various new bruises on the exposed sections 
of his arms now; and he winces as the guards tighten manacles 
around his ankles and wrists.

             NOLAN
     Guys-

The guards see their boss approaching with Kay in tow.

             NOLAN 
     Give us a minute.

They're surprised by the request - it's not protocol - but 
they obey: leave them alone with Samuel.

Nolan slides the Plexiglas door closed between Kay and 
Samuel, gives her a look before he heads off.

             NOLAN 
     Two minutes. He's due in the 
     chamber in five.

And he's gone; they're alone. Beat. She opens the voice port.

             KAY
     I came to say goodbye. 

             SAMUEL
     You should know by now that goodbye 
     doesn't apply to us.

             KAY
        (a smirk)
     I just know about me. I'm just a 
     regular woman trying to do her job-

             SAMUEL
     -You don't then. You are not a 
     regular woman; you are Laxmi and we 
     are one. We always help each other, 
     like you just helped me here. You 
     know who I am, but you're letting 
     the execution go through anyway. 
     We'll be back together soon I 
     promise-

             KAY
     He showed me the tablets Samuel.
     They're fake. Someone stepped 
     forward and admitted it.

CONTINUED:

He reacts.

             SAMUEL
     They're real, Kay. I know because I 
     was the one who planted them three 
     hundred thousand years ago.

She looks disappointed.

             SAMUEL 
     But I'm not even gonna try to 
     convince you because I know how 
     it's gonna sound.

             KAY
     Why not try a different way? If 
     you're the Lord of Light and know 
     everything about the future and the 
     past and all that...why would you 
     want to go through jail again?

             SAMUEL
     Sometimes you have to sacrifice a 
     pawn for positioning. One life is 
     just the blink of an eye to me. I 
     blink once and I see you again.

Beat.

She looks disappointed. Moves close the voice port-

             SAMUEL 
     Do you want to know where the 
     legend of Vishnu and Laxmi comes 
     from? In lore. You wanna know the 
     real story?

             KAY
     Goodbye Samuel-

             SAMUEL
     -He destroyed the world, but you 
     and I survived               .

She doesn't close the voice port.

             SAMUEL
     We'd hidden in a bunker below the 
     earth when it happened. And when 
     the bombing ended...we repopulated
     the earth. I am Vishnu, you are 
     Laxmi, and we give birth to the 
     world after Shiva destroys it. 

CONTINUED: ( 2)

             SAM UEL
     Our story ends up as lore in the 
     four vedas...but they're all very 
     real, they started with you and I,
     and every love you've ever had 
     before me only existed to prepare 
     you for me. 

He FLATTENS HIS PALM AGAINST THE PLEXIGLAS for her.

             SAMUEL 
     I'll see you in the next one.

The way he smiles: genuine, unblinking - he truly believes 
every word he just said. 

             KAY
     I'll see you in the next one.

She flattens her palm to his on the other side of the 
Plexiglas. Then exits, troubled.

INT. JOURNALIST VIEWING CHAMBER - EARLY EVENING

Kay takes a seat beside the only other attendant present: the 
LA Times Journalist from Culebra's execution. She's surprised 
to see him already there.

             KAY
     You're early.

Ineed, he's already clicking away at his laptop.

             LA TIMES JOURNALIST
     Cult leader being put to death is a 
     story. Most people don't remember 
     but he tried to kill Governor 
     Cayman a few years back. You 
     remember that?
        (she nods)
     You'd be surprised how popular 
     execution stories are in the 
     morning paper. Don't ask me why; 
     they're our most tagged. Maybe they 
     go well with cereal.

Other reporters are trickling in early as well.

             LA TIMES JOURNALIST
     You're early too.

CONTINUED:

             KAY
     How do you think this execution 
     will affect the announcement of 
     Cayman's Senate campaign?

Journalist's head shoots up. You'd think he just saw Bigfoot. 


             LA TIMES JOURNALIST
     Cayman is gonna make a run for the 
     Senate? How do you know?
        (off her wry smile)
     That public knowledge? 

She answers with another wry smile.

             KAY
     Guess you'll just have to trust me.

             LA TIMES JOURNALIST
        (beat)
     Do you mind, if I...

             KAY
     Didn't come from me.

Immediately Journalist digs out a Blackberry and starts 
typing away, excited, as-

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TWO-WAY MIRROR

Nolan enters the execution chamber with a MALE NURSE; they 
begin to prep the room for the procedure. 

It all suddenly becomes real. She sucks a breath as more 
reporters enter/find seats, and she glances over through...

THE SQUARE WINDOW SEPARATING THE OTHER VIEWING ROOM,

Where teary eyed family members of the victims find seats.

A GUARD IN THE FAMILY VIEWING CHAMBER

shuts the door, tests that it's closed, then hand-signals a 
nearby guard, "We're ready to start" - as - 

THE GUARD IN THE JOURNALISTS' VIEWING CHAMBER

moves to close his door as well when-

Somebody holds it open from the other side, and Albert Cayman 
enters the Journalists' Viewing Chamber with two aides.

CONTINUED: ( 2)

Everyone falls silent. Stunned by the surprise visitor. The 
governor takes an empty seat on the far side of the room. 


             LA TIMES JOURNALIST
        (whispers in Kay's ear)
     See? This one's a bigger deal than 
     most.

But Kay is gaping at the governor of California across the 
tiny room in shock...

...as Cayman glances over and HOLDS HER STARE.

IN THE EXECUTION CHAMBER

Samuel is rolled in on his gurney, leather restraints 
strapped across his chest - eyes locked on the ceiling. 

IN THE VIEWING CHAMBER

Kay is still staring at the governor, who DOESN'T LET GO OF 
HER GAZE.

             LA TIMES JOURNALIST 
        (notices)
     You two know each other?

Suddenly she rises, like a seasick passenger...

             LA TIMES JOURNALIST 
     You okay?

...and stumbles to the door, zombie-like... where the guard 
at the door tries to stop her:

             VIEWING CHAMBER GUARD
     We're about to start.

             KAY
     I don't feel well.

Indeed, she looks like she's going to throw up, so Guard lets 
her through, out into...

THE CONCRETE CORRIDORS

Where Kay blunders through - The WALLS SEEM TO SPIN AROUND 
HER and she has to support herself on a nearby column.

             KAY 
     I wanna see the tape.

INT. OFFICE CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

A surprised guard (GUARD JEREMY) outside Nolan's office looks 
up from his desk as Kay bursts in.

             KAY
     Of Samuel Desmet's escape. Is it in 
     his office?

             GUARD
     Uh...yeah, I think so, but...

She follows his gaze to-

THE BANK OF SECURITY MONITORS

Behind his desk - which shows a live feed of the execution 
across the ward. Nolan tests the restraints around Samuel.

             GUARD 
     There's an execution going on.

             KAY
     Please. Can I just...? Nolan 
     cleared it.

Confused, Guard rises and unlocks Nolan's door-

             GUARD
     Yeah, sure, but...

             KAY
     It'll just take a sec.

She enters NOLAN'S OFFICE, as we 

PAN BACK TO THE SECURITY BANK

AND HOLD ON THE MONITORS showing Samuel's execution in 
choppy, pixelated B&W.

Nolan tapes the catheter to Samuel's wrist.

PUSH IN ON MONITOR

INT. EXECUTION CHAMBER - SAME

As the male nurse nearby checks the machine that will inject 
the drugs into Samuel's veins. 

Samuel's eyes don't leave the ceiling, even as Nolan tightens 
the final restraint and uses the opportunity to lean in:

CONTINUED:

             NOLAN
     I'm gonna miss you, believe it or 
     not. You're one of the braver-

             SAMUEL
     -Shuttup. You're giving me a 
     headache.

Nolan frowns, then surreptitiously TWISTS the IV in Samuel's 
wrist for a painful pinch (Samuel doesn't flinch) before 
signaling to the nurse that he's done. 

The two men exit. 

Samuel is left alone. The beeping of the lethal injection 
machine his only company.

SUDDENLY SAMUEL LOOKS OVER at the two-way into the 
Journalists' viewing chamber - And although he couldn't 
possibly be looking through it... he seems to be STARING at 
someone on the other side.

CUT TO - Albert Cayman - staring back.

INT. NOLAN'S OFFICE - SAME

Kay cycles through the security footage from a hard drive on 
one of the Nolan's monitors. 

ON THE MONITOR

The transport bus flips over in the middle of the street. 
Grainy security cam footage angled oddly, so grainy that we 
can barely make anything out. It was clearly taken from a 
nearby ATM camera.

Kay rewinds, then replays: The bus veers, flips over.

How could Samuel have done it?

Grainy footage of Samuel climbing out of the upside-down bus, 
moving out of the way for a swerving car.

Kay rewinds and replays. There's nothing to gleam from the 
footage as to how he did it.

But she rewinds and replays one more time...and pauses it.

Her face goes slack.

INT. EXECUTION CHAMBER - SAME

Samuel's head taps lightly on the metal headrest of his 
gurney as he stares at the ceiling. Face inscrutable. The 
warden's voice calls out from the speakers:

             WARDEN
     Do you have any last words?

Samuel stops tapping his head. Is he gonna say something?

He tap-tap-taps his head on the headrest again. Nope.

             WARDEN
     Then on behalf of the State of 
     California the procedure shall 
     begin.

The machine releases the thiopental into his vein. In 
response, his head taps HARDER against the headrest.

INT. NOLAN'S OFFICE - SAME

Kay replays what it was that made her stop, and we see it:

ON THE MONITOR- Samuel climbs out of the overturned transport 
bus, moves aside... and a speeding car swerves past.

She now cycles through the footage frame by frame, and it 
becomes more evident that: Samuel, without turning his head, 
moved aside before the car shot past. She pauses it on-

Samuel, staring at something on the other side of the street. 
Not running, not panicking, simply looking at something.

As Kay peers closer...she sees it: a MANHOLE COVER.

MOMENTS LATER

Kay bursts out of Nolan's office, asks the guard outside:

             KAY
     Do you still have a copy of the 
     police reports from the bus 
     incident? Did they check the 
     sewers?

Guard Jeremy looks over but seems preoccupied by the 
execution on his security monitor.

             GUARD
     Um...yeah... They're in here, I 
     think...

CONTINUED:

Bends down to search through his files while throwing 
distracted looks up at the monitor...

             GUARD 
     They found some old tools in there, 
     from like the seventies or 
     something. He got lucky. They 
     helped him get past security.

ON Kay. Thinking.

             KAY
     ...What about in the bus?
        (Guard looks confused)
     In the bus. Inside... the seats. Or 
     the headrest. Any of the pre-built 
     parts...

But Kay stops when she sees the live execution feed.

Samuel beats his head to the headrest with alarming force.

             GUARD
     He's panicking. 

             KAY
     ...He's not panicking.
        (sees nametag)
     Jeremy...get people out of that 
     viewing room. I think something's 
     about to happen.

             GUARD
     Don't worry. I've seen it happen 
     before, sometimes they just freak 
     out-

             KAY
     -No. I need your help getting 
     everyone out of that room, now.

INT. EXECUTION CHAMBER - SAME

Samuel bangs his head into the headrest harder and harder. 
Looks like he's having an epileptic seizure.

MICRO ON THE HEADREST- Where we see a tiny round fissure
encircling the headrest's support frame. It seems old and 
made with a knife. But...how can that be?

Samuel's head bucks once- Twice- And- CRACK                            . THE HEADREST 
SNAPS IN TWO, EXPOSING THE SUPPORT FRAME'S HOLLOW TUBING.

CONTINUED:

IN THE VIEWING CHAMBERS

Several of the spectators rise to their feet.

             VIEWING CHAMBER GUARD
        (into radio)
     What's going on? Get someone in 
     there, now.

IN THE EXECUTION CHAMBER

Samuel wrenches his neck to peer into the HOLLOW AREA, where 
we see the long rusty SHIV-LIKE BLADE caked in years' worth 
of dust inside.. HE SLIDES IT OUT WITH HIS TEETH.

IN THE VIEWING CHAMBER

More spectators including Governor Cayman rise now, 
increasingly alarmed.

             VIEWING CHAMBER GUARD 
     Don't worry. Everything is under 
     control.

But the guard doesn't look so sure, even as...

WE INTERCUT WITH THE EXECUTION CHAMBER

Where Nolan barrels in- 

AS SAMUEL SLICES THE RESTRAINTS AND SITS UP. 

SUDDENLY NOLAN RUSHES HIM-

But Samuel's hand is a blur- He brings his palm to Nolan's 
trachea, leaves the head guard writhing on the floor as he 
yanks the IV's off and slides off the gurney.

Included among all those things that Samuel has learned over 
countless years...Martial Arts is apparently in the arsenal.

             SAMUEL
        (to Nolan)
     No reason to miss me, I'm not 
     leaving yet.

IN THE VIEWING CHAMBERS

Guard ushers terrified spectators out, but several of the 
ballsier reporters including LA Times Journalist refuse to 
leave, excitedly reporting via internet (now                               it's a story).

ON GOVERNOR CAYMAN

CONTINUED: ( 2)

Motionless. In shock. Even as his aides plea with him that:


             CAYMAN AIDE
     We have to go!

IN THE EXECUTION CHAMBER

Samuel walks up to the mirror with the shiv, GOUGES A CIRCLE 
ON THE PLEXIGLAS. Guards bang on the locked door behind him. 
Samuel suddenly PUNCHES THROUGH THE MIRROR!

Full panic now.

Cayman lets himself get pulled with the fleeing spectators - 
even the LA Times Journalist abandons his laptop.

IN THE CORRIDORS

Kay strides through with Guard Jeremy who's on his radio:

             GUARD JEREMY
     -more people into the execution 
     wing as soon as you can, something 
     might happen-

Panicked spectators stream past in the opposite direction. A 
surprised Jeremy lowers his radio. How did Kay know? Viewing 
Chamber Guard sees them approaching.

             VIEWING CHAMBER GUARD
     You can't go back there - We're 
     evacuating everyone -

             KAY
     Where is he? Samuel? He still in 
     the room?

Before he can respond, she spots across the corridor-

- Cayman getting hustled away via his aides and two guards. 
They're cutting through an ADJACENT WING. She knows where 
Samuel will go.

She moves to push through but Guard clamps her arm- hard-

             VIEWING CHAMBER GUARD
     Doctor, we can't let anyone through 
     - I'm sorry -

But she looks from Viewing Chamber Guard to Guard Jeremy, 
realizes there's no arguing to be done, and wrenches her arm 
away - rushes into the chaos-

CONTINUED: ( 3)

             VIEWING CHAMBER GUARD 
     Shit. Go after her.

Guard Jeremy moves after Kay.

Around them - Guards attempt to control the stampede. 

If someone doesn't stop Samuel, it will be pandemonium.

EXT. SAN QUENTIN VILLAGE - SAME

Media outside seems to have gotten wind of it, because-

             KTLA REPORTER
        (into her camera)
     -fielding reports of an injury in 
     the execution chamber, where, as we 
     were reporting earlier convicted 
     bomber and cult leader Samuel 
     Desmet was set to be put to death-

             KABC REPORTER
     -as you know, cameras are not 
     allowed inside the execution but we 
     are hearing reports of a panic 
     inside the prison-

             KCAL 9 REPORTER
     -emails that Governor Cayman 
     himself attended the execution and 
     is currently still inside-

INT. EXECUTION WING CORRIDORS - SAME

With Samuel - marching through as KLAXONS BLARE and emergency 
lights twirl. The red flares give the entire ward a bloody 
crimson tint. Through the barred windows: faint HOWL OF 
POLICE SIRENS, winking lights of a DISTANT HELICOPTER.

On Samuel's face: single-minded focus. 

Suddenly Kay rounds the corner and blocks                             his path.  

             SAMUEL
     Please move out of the way Kay. You 
     know the enormity of what's at 
     stake.

She stands her ground. He gently pushes through, but she 
follows in-step, panicked-

             KAY
     What are you gonna do Samuel?

CONTINUED:


             SAMUEL
     -You know what I'm gonna do. I 
     thought he'd come and he came. Like 
     I told you, I sacrificed a pawn and 
     lured him in.

Suddenly Guard Jeremy ROUNDS THE CORNER WITH HIS GUN! 

SAMUEL SHOVES HER OUT OF THE WAY, SIDESTEPS LEFT JUST BEFORE- 
BAM. A BULLET HOLE EXPLODES BESIDE SAMUEL'S HEAD! HE 
SIDESTEPS TO THE RIGHT A MERE SECOND BEFORE- A SECOND HOLE 
EXPLODES WHERE HE WAS STANDING JUST MOMENTS EARLIER!

Two quick strides forward and he disarms Jeremy- Smashes his 
palm to his throat- leaves the youg man curled on the floor 
heaving for air.

ON KAY

Slack-jawed- How did he do that?

As Samuel leaves her behind-

             KAY
     Samuel...

He stops and turns; she has trouble getting the words out:

             KAY 
     Has this...happened before?

             SAMUEL
        (nods)
     But Cayman wasn't here last time, 
     and I didn't get very far. I was 
     actually killed right around here. 
     By your good friend Nolan. Get 
     down.

And- We're now with Nolan, barreling around the corner with 
his REVOLVER ready to fire.

             SAMUEL 
        (she doesn't move)
     I said get down Kay, please.

She's too confused/alarmed to do anything but follow orders, 
as he trains his gun on an empty spot on the wall, waits a 
moment and FIRES- 

- Just before Nolan rounds the corner and a HOLE EXPLODES IN 
HIS LEG. His revolver clatters to the floor and he crumples 
clutching his leg/screaming.

ON KAY, terrified for a hundred different reasons. 

Samuel disappears down the hall. On Cayman's heels. She 
scrambles up to follow but-

             NOLAN
     Doctor.

She look back at the injured Nolan who struggles to sit up. 
Pushes his revolver across the floor.  

             NOLAN 
     You need to take him out. He trusts 
     you.

Beat. Kay looks from the gun to Nolan, snatches the gun and 
follows Samuel.

I/E. GENERAL HOUSING BLOCK (GHB) - NIGHT

Inmates bang on their bars/cheer the chaos.

But even they fall silent at the sight of- 

The governor of California and his aides being led through 
the catwalks by two prison guards.

They howl and scream! Guards beat arms back with batons. 

CUT TO:

SAMUEL, MARCHING PAST EMERGENCY LIGHTS/BLARING KLAXONS-

He cracks the gun barrel, counts the bullets (there's six 
left)-  Breaches the tiered honeycomb of cells that makes up 
the General Housing Block; he spots Cayman and his entourage-

ONE LEVEL BELOW HIM.

They're being led down the catwalk by the guards toward the-

INGRESSION UNIT.

Much like Receiving, Ingression is comprised of TWO REMOTELY 
CONTROLLED METAL DOORS. They separate the GHB from the 
outside world. When Cayman breaches the IU, he'll be free. 

Samuel sucks a breath- first time we've seen him unsure of 
anything- He drapes a leg over a railing, then the other... 
He's going to let himself fall. 

             KAY
     Samuel please-!

CONTINUED:

He glances back to see-

Kay pushing through the chainlink doors, Nolan's GUN trained 
on him. Her hands tremble.

             KAY 
     You have to stop.

             SAMUEL
     You should turn and walk away. I've 
     never gotten this far before. I 
     don't know what's going to happen 
     next and can't guarantee your 
     safety.

She doesn't lower the gun.

             KAY
     I'm sorry. I can't let you go on.

He looks hurt and surprised by her lack of belief.

             SAMUEL
     ...Do you know the death and 
     suffering that happened after he 
     becomes president? The world 
     doesn't die immediately, it takes 
     months, as people slowly die of 
     starvation and radiation. Families 
     turn on each other. Brother against 
     brother, father against son. It is 
     the darkest time in the history of 
     the planet and this time around it 
     might be everyone-!

HE LETS HIMSELF PLUMMET!

Kay gasps and sprints to the edge of the railing to see-

ONE LEVEL BELOW HER

Samuel gripped onto the catwalk railing                          ; with a grunt he 
pulls himself over and continues after the governor.

Inmates let out a GIANT CHEER across all four levels of the 
GHB, which makes-

GOVERNOR CAYMAN

look over, and react at the sight of Samuel on the catwalk. 
Closing in.  Genuine fear flashes in the governor's eyes- 

As a guard suddenly steps past him and FIRES AT SAMUEL-

CONTINUED: (2)

-Who ducks down as SPARKS of gunfire dance around the 
catwalk. Even the inmates briefly fall silent.

             PRISON GUARD 2
     Don't- you'll hit the cells-

And he's right- So the guard stops firing and rushes Cayman 
and the aides toward the first door of the Ingression Unit. 
Mere yards away from freedom now.

ON THE THIRD LEVEL

Kay has found a small service LADDER and slowly/carefully 
climbs down - a long but necessary detour through the

SECOND LEVEL

Where Governor/aides/guards finally reach the Ingression door-

BAM-BAM-BAM. Bullets ricochet around the first door! REVEAL 
Samuel marching forward, out of cover, EMPTYING HIS GUN!

Guard 1 FIRES BACK BUT- HE SCREAMS, clutching his leg! BAM.
Guard 2 screams and holds a bloody shoulder!

He kicks Guard 1's gun away - plucks up Guard 2's revolver; 
checks the barrel of the gun. Six more bullets to do the job.

CAYMAN AND HIS AIDES 

LOCK THE FIRST MAGNETIC DOOR behind them as Samuel breaches 
the unit, firing at the Plexiglas door.

He's only separated from Cayman by the bullet-proof magnetic 
door. For a moment, the two men stare at each other. Pure 
hate tempered through countless years of warfare.

             SAMUEL
     Check.

The aides work frantically on UNLOCKING THE SECOND DOOR as 
FIREMEN AND POLICE chop away at it from the outside.  Whoever 
gets through first will win.

CUT TO:

KAY

Inching down the catwalk. She can hear the commotion in the 
IU. She's terrified but still whitekuckling Nolan's gun when-

A HAND GRABS HER LEG and she SHRIEKS-

CONTINUED: (3)

But it's one of the injured guards. Worming on the floor.


             PRISON GUARD
     You have to keep the doors locked.
        (off her look)
     Here. 

He hands her

HIS MAGNETIC KEY CARD

             PRISON GUARD 
     There's a control box - room next 
     door - wave that through-

She sees what he means, spots in an adjacent room the

CONTROL BOX 

With the flashing red LED light that controls the doors' 
magnetic locks. 

SAMUEL 

Firing/kicking at the door, has managed to SPIDERWEB the 
Plexiglas. He catches sight of the control box in the next 
room, and a thought seems to cross his head as he spins to 

KAY

Standing behind him holding the keycard.

Frozen. 

His eyes fall on the keycard.

Each knows what the other is thinking. 

Suddenly Kay BOLTS INTO THE ROOM WITH THE CONTROL BOX AND 
LOCKS HERSELF IN!

The firemen, meanwhile, almost have the second door open                                     . 
They continue to chop at it with axes and a BATTERING RAM.

             SAMUEL
     Kay...you need to open this door. 

She shakes her head, tears in her eyes - 

             KAY
     I can't. You need to give yourself 
     up. There's no way out. Please, 
     just put the gun down.

CONTINUED: (4)

             SAMUEL
     I'm not doing this for me! I'm 
     doing it for you and for the rest 
     of the world! 

The police and firemen are mere minutes from breaking through 
the second door and freeing Cayman.

             SAMUEL 
     You need to open the door, now!
     If you don't...billions of people 
     will die. I've seen it and it's 
     worse than anything mankind has 
     ever experienced. For once I need 
     you to believe! For once I need you 
     to open your eyes!

ON KAY

Staring at the keycard, at the Control Box flashing red - 
Looks up at the firemen, TEARING A HOLE THROUGH THE 
PLEXIGLAS, now climbing in - She catches Cayman's eye, 
staring at her - Arms reaching to pull him to safety - 

             SAMUEL 
     YOU NEED TO DO IT NOW-!

Kay swipes the key card across the Control Box. 

The red light flashes GREEN - magnetic locks disengage- 

Samuel is let through, before rescuers can pull Cayman away-

IN SLOW-MO...he enters the space with the trapped governor, 
ALL SOUND FADES AWAY as Samuel lifts the revolver...

ON CAYMAN'S EYES- We expect fear, but it's strangely absent.

             GOVERNOR CAYMAN
        (sotto)
     ...Checkmate.

Suddenly Samuel's body is pierced with bullets from several 
angles! His prison jumpsuit turns to bloody shreds as he's 
torn through with gunfire from various unseen sources!

AND SOUND RUSHES BACK IN as Kay lets out an involuntary 
scream, eyes the size of saucers as she watches Samuel's 
lifeless body SLAP THE FLOOR in front of Cayman.

And now- Rescuers YANK CAYMAN AND HIS AIDES OUT and the room 
explodes into a cacophony of screams/orders/shouts.

CONTINUED: (5)

CAYMAN 

manages to look over and meets eyes with Kay as he's 
swallowed up by the tentacle of arms.

ON KAY

Left alone, taking it all in:

Samuel's corpse, face-down in an expanding pool of blood. 

The paramedics rushing into the help the injured guards.

The terrified Governor's Aides, throwing her accusing looks 
as they talk to police. In fact, she's getting many looks.

BLACK

             POLICE OFFICER
     She let him through. We have 
     reports from several witnesses that 
     she pushed the key to let the 
     escaped inmate into the Ingression 
     Unit.

FADE IN ON 

KAY

Slumped on a chair, we're not quite sure where...

             POLICE OFFICER
     All of them are willing to testify.

SLOWLY PULL BACK TO REVEAL... She's in Nolan's office. Her 
hand is cuffed to the chair.

She lifts her beleaguered gaze up to Nolan's frosted office 
window. HER POV- Of various people outside including Nolan, 
the mayor and the CHIEF OF POLICE conferring on her fate. 
QUICK CUTS OF LIPS MOVING (WE HEAR ONLY SNIPPETS IN V.O.)

             CHIEF OF POLICE
     ...boyfriend is outside. We just 
     spoke to him. He said they just 
     broke up two days ago...

             NOLAN
     ...might have been having other 
     personal problems... I'm not really 
     the one to ask...

CONTINUED: (6)

             MAYOR
     ... you worked together for almost 
     a week...we need to know everything 
     you saw from when she started, via 
     an affidavit preferably...

We hear the word "distraught" somewhere in there.

ON KAY. Staring into nothing.

             NOLAN
     ...how did he know to have 
     snipers...

And now- Her head cocks up. She strains to read the Chief of 
Police's MOVING LIPS- But catches only:

             CHIEF OF POLICE
     ...precautionary safety measures...

And another officer, adding:

             A POLICE OFFICER
     ...glad he did, aren't we...

Her gaze falls to the floor again, her soul defeated. 

             CHIEF OF POLICE
     Is he pressing charges?

             MAYOR
     No. He's being a good guy about it. 
     Too good if you ask me.

             CHIEF OF POLICE
     I'm sure the press wouldn't be 
     great for it. He's running for 
     Senate next year ain't he? I just 
     read about it on some website.

             NOLAN
     Look. I know what happened. Samuel 
     Desmet had done this before. He was 
     a conniving sonofabitch who could 
     get in peoples' heads and turn them 
     in some inexplicable way. 
        (then)
     He got to her. It's as sad but as 
     simple as that. He simply got to 
     her.

BLACK.

CONTINUED: (7)

Long beat.

             POLICE CHIEF
     Don't matter. Either way...she's 
     losing her license and the prison 
     is filing a litany of endangerment 
     charges. ... One way or another, 
     poor girl's life is over.

FADE TO BLACK.

INT. CENTRAL CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S FACILITY - 22 YEARS LATER

CLOSE ON prison-issue Velcro tennis shoes. PAN UP the orange 
jumpsuit to- Kay, 20 years older. Streaks of gray. Still 
attractive. Hauling a dented metal lunch tray to the

MESS HALL

Takes a seat beside two other female inmates. Exchange 
pleasantries.

A NEW ANCHOR'S VOICE CONTINUED draws her attention to THE 
TELEVISION SET hanging in the corner.

She rises, approaches...

ON THE TV

A KTLA ANCHOR reports on:

             KTLA ANCHOR
     ...spoke with several of the 
     protesters gathered outside the 
     former missile range, which US 
     Naval Forces announced will also be 
     used to house two nuclear 
     submarines.

ON KAY

Silent.

             KTLA ANCHOR
     Not only do the island's longtime 
     residents, but ecologists who've
     kept a close eye on the fragile 
     ecosystem of Kauai all fear that 
     the subs, if used for testing-

A FEMALE GUARD moves past.

                                  (CONTINUED)


CONTINUED:

             FEMALE GUARD
     Margolis.

Kay turns, expecting the guard to tell her to get away from 
the TV. Instead:

             FEMALE GUARD 
     Your public defender's here.

             KAY
     I don't have an appointment.

             FEMALE GUARD
     Well what can I say, he's here.

             KAY
     I haven't talked to him in years.

             FEMALE GUARD
     It's a new guy. Young. Cute, too. 
     Should I have him leave?

VISITATION BOOTH - LATER

Kay takes a seat across from-

ADAM MBADINUJU (21), Nigerian, baby-faced. 

She picks up the phone, takes her new public defender in 
skeptically behind the Plexiglas. He's a kid in a suit.

             KAY
     No one told me I had an 
     appointment.

             ADAM
     My name is Adam Mbadinuju. I'm your 
     new lawyer. 

             KAY
     How old are you Adam?

             ADAM
     Twenty-one. I graduated early.

             KAY
     Oh-kay. Goodbye Adam-

Kay moves to hang up the phone.

CONTINUED: (2)

             ADAM
     I filed a new appeal with the 
     Parole Board yesterday. This one 
     will go through.

             KAY
        (sigh)
     Don't bother.

She rises to leave.

             ADAM
     You should hear me out. You ever 
     wondered why-

             KAY
     -No. And I doubt I ever will-

	    KAY 
	-No matter what it is you're 
	gonna say.

		ADAM
	You haven't listened to what 
	it is.

             KAY 
     Look. Adam, right? I've been in 
     here for twenty-two years, longer 
     than you've been alive-

             ADAM
     There's a reason for that.

             KAY
     Yes.  Because I let myself get 
     duped by a madman, and I've paid 
     for it with my life. I'm now due to 
     get out in three more years. With 
     all due respect, all the State's 
     appeals and motions and attempts at 
     dismissals haven't made a lick of 
     difference in two decades, so 
     please- feel free to let it go-

             ADAM
     Maybe it was necessary positioning. 

Kay goes stiff at those words.

             ADAM 
     You're safer in jail.  

             KAY
     ...What did you say?

CONTINUED: (3)


             ADAM
     You're safer behind bars Kay. He 
     would've had to kill you if you 
     were on the outside telling the 
     world your story. You sacrificed 
     twenty years but it saved your 
     life, and now it's time to strike.

The color has drained from her face as she listens.

             ADAM 
     You ever wonder why I didn't just 
     say I was guilty from the start?
     If the execution needed to go 
     through from the start for me to 
     get out. Why say all those 
     things...And not just save myself 
     the trouble and let myself die?

ON Adam- staring intently through the bulletproof glass.

ON Kay- gone completely silent. Doesn't breathe.

             ADAM
     Because when today came I wouldn't 
     have time to convince you from the 
     start. I needed you to believe 
     right away. We don't have three 
     years. Next month, it'll all be 
     over. I need to get you out now.

FADE OUT.
