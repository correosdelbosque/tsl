EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

A bird lands on the ground.  It pecks at something, then the 
head stays up and another head pecks at the ground.  It turns 
and we see that it has two heads.

It squawks and flies off....

A SCHOOL BUS makes its way down the street.  Singing can be 
heard from the kids inside.  Pan up to reveal Frighton 
Elementary on the side of the bus.

             KIDS
        (singing)
      The neck bones connected to the: 
      head bone.  The head bones 
      connected to the: horn bone.  The 
      horn bones right above the...wing 
      bones.
        (laughing)

The bus pulls into a parking lot.

The bus doors open and a THIRD GRADE CLASS OF MONSTER KIDS 
pour through, pushing and yelling and laughing and being 
generally chaotic.

             KID #1
      RAHR!

             KID #2
      Ahh!

             KID #1
      I scared you!

             KID #2
        (laughing)
      No you didn't!

             MRS. GRAVES
      Okay, remember our field trip rules 
      everyone:  No pushing, no biting, 
      and no fire-breathing.

One of the kids breathes fire on one of his friends.

             FIRE STUDENT
        (breathing fire)
      RAHR!

      


                                          2.
A TEACHER MONSTER, MRS. GRAVES, stands over him, giving him a 
stern look.

             MRS. GRAVES
      What did I just say?
        (sigh)
      18, 19...?  Okay, were missing 
      one.  Who are we missing?

ON THE CLOSED BUS DOORS.

A little green hand knocks on the windowed doors.

ON MRS. GRAVES.

             MRS. GRAVES
	(CONTD)
        (realizing - this isnt 
         the first time...)
      Oooh, Mike Wazowski. 

The bus doors open revealing a very tiny, 8-year-old Mike 
Wazowski, smiling.

             YOUNG MIKE
      Thanks Joe!  Good luck finishing 
      your crossword puzzle!

             MRS. GRAVES
      Sorry, Michael!  I didnt see you.

Mrs. Graves approaches and Mike jumps down.  When Mike hits 
the ground, we see how much bigger all the other kids are.

             YOUNG MIKE
      Thats okay.  When I was on the 
      bus, I found a nickel!

Mike walks away, holding the nickel.

             YOUNG MIKE
	(CONTD)
        (sotto)
      I wish I had pockets....

             MRS. GRAVES
        (to the kids)
      Okay, everyone, partner up.  Get 
      your field trip buddy!

ON MIKE as he tries to buddy with the kids who all happen to 
be bigger than him.

             YOUNG MIKE
      Jeremy?  You and me?  Okay, no 
      biggie.  Haley?  No?  

      


             YOUNG MIKE	(CONT'D)
      Pairing up with Claire?  Great 
      choice, shes a good egg.  Russell.  
      Mike.  Wazowski?  We carpool.  
      Were cousins.

                                          3.

             PHIL, RUSSELL
        (high-fiving)
      Hey!

Phil and Russell head off.

             YOUNG MIKE
      Okay, good catching up!

Everyone has paired up, leaving Mike on his own.  For a 
second, Mikes smile falters.

Mrs. Graves approaches and smiles bitter-sweetly.

             MRS. GRAVES
      Well, Michael, it looks like its 
      you and me again.

             YOUNG MIKE
        (small laugh)

Mrs. Graves takes Mikes hand.

Mike sees the kids walking up ahead.

             YOUNG MIKE
	(CONTD)
        (to his teacher)
      Cmon Karen, were falling behind.

Mike tugs on Mrs. Graves hand, pulling her toward the other 
students.

             MRS. GRAVES
        (laugh)
      Please dont call me Karen.

As we crane up, REVEAL were at Monsters, Incorporated.

INT. MONSTERS, INC. - HALLWAY

Mrs. Gravess class is met by a monster TOUR GUIDE.

             MI TOUR GUIDE
      Now stay close together, we're 
      entering a very dangerous area.

The field trip is entering a scare floor.

      


             MI TOUR GUIDE	(CONTD)
      Welcome to the scare floor.

The students are in awe as they see the scare floor.

                                          4.

             KIDS
        (walla)
      Whoa!

             MI TOUR GUIDE
      This is where we collect the scream 
      energy to power our whole world.  
      And can anyone tell me whose job it 
      is to go get that scream?

             KIDS
      Scarers!

             MI TOUR GUIDE
      Thats right!  Now which one of you 
      can give me the scariest roar?

             KIDS
        (raising hands)
      Ooh!  Ooh!  Me!  Me!

Mike has his hand raised too.

             YOUNG MIKE
      Ooh, sir!  Right here, little green 
      guy at 2 oclock!

             KID #1
      Roar!

             KID #2
      No, no, its like this!  Raahhr!

             YOUNG MIKE
      Hey guys, watch this one!

             KID #3
      RAAAWRR!

             YOUNG MIKE
      Hey, hey, I got a really goo-

             KID #4
      BRAAAR!

             KID #5
      GRAAAAHR!



      


                                          5.
             YOUNG MIKE
      RAAAAAOOWRRRRRRRR!

The kids turn around.

             KID #1
      Whoa...

             KIDS
      Whoa.

The entire group of kids is staring at Mike, eyes wide.  He 
is amazed, for the first time all eyes are on him.  Then, 
Mike realizes the kids are actually looking PAST him.  Mike 
turns and his eye goes wide too.  A group of SCARERS are 
walking onto the scare floor - confident, cool, and awesome.

             YOUNG MIKE
      Whoa.

One of the scarers approaches the kids.  He wears an old, 
worn-in MU cap.

             MU SCARER
      Well, hey there kids!  Are you on a 
      tour with your school?

             KIDS
        (cheering)
      Yeah!

             MRS. GRAVES
      Yes, were here to learn about 
      scream energy, and what it takes to 
      be a scarer!

             MU SCARER
      Well hey, youre in luck.  Because 
      I just happen to be a scarer!  I 
      learned everything I know from my 
      school, Monsters University.

             YOUNG MIKE
        (in awe)
      Whoa...

             MU SCARER
      Its the best scaring school there 
      is.

Another scarer, sneaks up behind him and takes his hat.

             FEAR TECH SCARER
      You wish, Fear Techs the best.

      


                                          6.
The MU scarer snatches his hat back, smiling.

             MU SCARER
      Okay, you guys watch us and tell me 
      which school's the best.  Alright?
        (whispered, he 
         surreptitiously points to 
         his cap)
      MU is.

Employees (Scarers, assistants, can wranglers, etc.) start to 
stream onto the floor.  The tour guide ushers Mike and the 
students to a viewing area. 

ON MIKE, studying everything on the scare floor.  Not 
watching, he puts a foot past the line.

             MI TOUR GUIDE
      Oops.  Stop right there.  Dont 
      cross over that safety line, human 
      children are extremely toxic.

Mike steps back and watches all the activity, in awe.  But 
just as the doors start to get wheeled onto the floor, the 
bigger kids push their way to the front, blocking Mikes 
view.

             KIDS
        (excited walla)
      Look at that!

             YOUNG MIKE
      Whoa - hey...guys, watch the eye!  
      Ow!

Mike pops out from the back of the crowd and falls on his 
butt, but pops right back up again.

             KIDS
        (walla)
      Whoa!/Wow!

             YOUNG MIKE
      Excuse me, fellas.  How about we do 
      tallest in the back?

Mike is desperate to see.  He jumps up, ducks down, peeks 
between legs and sees:

-a glimpse of a door being put into the door station.

-a glimpse of a doors light glowing red.

      


                                          7.
-a glimpse of a scarer warming up, snarling, etc.

             MEAN KID
      Did you see that?

             KID #1
      Look, hes gonna do a real scare!

             KIDS
        (excited walla)
      Whoa!

And then, Mikes view is blocked completely.

             YOUNG MIKE
        (sigh)

             MEAN KID
      Cool!  I wanna be a scarer!

             KID #2
      Yeah, me too!

Mike gives it one more shot.

             YOUNG MIKE
      Come on guys, I wanna see!

             MEAN KID
      Out of the way, Wazowski, you dont 
      belong on a scare floor.

             KIDS
        (walla)
      Whoa!  Cool!

Mike backs away as his smile fades.

Mike looks frustrated, not being able to see.  Just then, a 
cart full of scream cans comes toward Mike.  He gets an idea.

ON TEACHER.

She tries to keep the kids together.

             MRS. GRAVES
      Brian, do not step over the line.

One of them points to the scare floor.

             EMMET
      Mrs. Graves?  Michael went over the 
      line.

      


                                          8.
Mrs. Graves eyes go wide.

             MRS. GRAVES
        (scream)
      Michael?!

They all see Mike watching the MU scarer as he opens the door 
to the human world and slinks inside.  The door starts to 
close behind him.  But not before Mike, moving fast, slips 
through the door and into the human world too!

INT. HUMAN KIDS ROOM - NIGHT

Inside the human kids room, Mike hides in the shadows as the 
scarer starts his stealthy approach to the kid.  The scarer 
is totally unaware that Mike is in the room.

Mikes terrified, but the more he watches the scarer, the 
more he gets caught up in the excitement and awe of it all.

The scarer is about to scare when suddenly the kids bedroom 
door opens and the parents peep in.  Mike is hiding right 
behind the door, inches away from the humans!

The scarer hides too, blending into the shadows.

             MOM
      See, I told you hes fine.

             DAD
      Well, I thought I heard something.

The parents close the door and the scarer re-emerges, 
continuing to build his scare.

Mike watches the scarer scratch the end of the bed.

The kid hears this and rises up in bed.  The scarer slides 
under the side of the bed and then looms up over the kid.

SCREAM!

ON MIKE as he watches.  His mouth falls open, in awe.

INT. SCARE FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

The scream can fills to the top.

The MU scarer steps through the door, a satisfied look on his 
face - a solid scare.  The door shuts down.

      


                                          9.
And then he stops in his tracks when he realizes there are 
dozens of people staring at him, panicked.

             MU SCARER
      What?

The MU scarer steps aside, revealing Mike smiling, a dazed, 
dreamy look in his eye.

Mike is swarmed by angry people - his teacher, factory 
employees, etc.

             CROWD
      What were you thinking?!
        (walla)
      This is ridiculous, young man!  You 
      coulda got yourself killed, kid!  
      Did you touch anything?!  Do you 
      know what could have happened?!

Meanwhile, as the scarer who was in the room with Mike dons 
his MU hat, someone comes over and confers with him.  The 
scarer looks over at Mike, putting things together.

As the angry walla continues, the MU scarer approaches Mike 
again, sternly.  Mike is still in awe of everything he just 
saw.

             MU SCARER
      That was real dangerous, kid.  I 
      didnt even know you were in there.

Mike looks at the scarer, ashamed.  

And then, the scarer cant help but smile, realizing 
something.

             MU SCARER
	(CONTD)
        (impressed)
      Wow, I didnt even know you were in 
      there....
        (laugh)
      Not bad, kid.

He winks and slaps his MU hat on Mike, then crosses away.

             MRS. GRAVES
      Michael, what do you have to say 
      for yourself?

Mike smiles the biggest, happiest smile youve ever seen.

             YOUNG MIKE
      How do I become a scarer?

      


                                          10.
Push in to a CU of the MU logo.

The eye in the M looks from right to left and Mike pops up 
from behind it.

Mike uses the D in Disney as teeth and frightens the 
credits off screen. 

Mike draws on a chalkboard.  The chalk flies into the air and 
creates:

Scare cards flash across the screen, with Mike drawing his 
own.

Mike is studying with stacks of books around him.

Mikes report card, A+, horrifying.  He bursts through it 
with a roar!

The letters from the card break up and fall into an envelope.

Mike tears it open and hes ecstatic!  He got into...

REVEAL MIKE, beaming, brimming with excitement.  He turns to 
face everyone on the bus.

      


                                          11.
             MIKE
        (happy sigh)
      Well everyone, I dont mean to get 
      emotional but everything in my life 
      has led to this moment.  Let it not 
      be just the beginning of my dream,

      dreams.  Gladys, promise me youll

      is out there somewhere!  Phil, keep 
      using the ointment until that thing 
      goes away!  I wish you all the 
      best, thank you all so much!

No response from the bus crowd.

             BUS DRIVER
        (dead pan)
      Im welling up with tears, now get 
      off.

Unphased, Mike exits the bus.

EXT. BUS

Mike leaps down the stairs and gathers his bags.

He stares up in awe....

REVEAL MONSTERS UNIVERSITY: The gate, with the campus beyond.

EXT. CAMPUS

Mike walks onto a campus filled with monster students of all 
shapes and sizes.  In the background, the grand, classic 
architecture of an Ivy League school.

             MIKE
      Hello.  How ya doing?

A student on a bicycle whooshes by.

Students play monster hackey sack in the quad as another 
student with several arms posts signs to a lamppost.  

A student on a skateboard whizzes by as a giant monster steps 
over Mike and moves to catch a frisbee.

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
        (ground shaking vocs)
      Ah!

      


                                          12.
             FRISBEE MONSTER
      Woo hoo!

             MIKE
        (excited laugh)

She catches the frisbee and sends it back to her friend.

                                  CUT TO:

EXT. BRIDGE 

Mike walks over a bridge on a small river.  He looks down and 
sees more students, swimming into what must be an underwater 
section of the school.

Mike checks his list:

             MIKE
      Ok, first thing on my list... get 
      registered!

A monster in a Smile Squad shirt steps up to Mike.

             JAY THE RA
      Hey there, freshman!  Im Jay the 
      RA, and Im here to say that 
      registration is that-a-way!

             MIKE
      Okay Jay!

Mike heads toward the registration area.  

             JAY THE RA
      Have a great first day!

Mike steps up to the registration table.

             KAY THE RA
      Hey, Im Kay!  Heres your 
      orientation packet!

             MIKE
      Thanks Kay!

             KAY THE RA
      You can drop your bags off here and 
      get your picture taken with Trey!

Kay motions toward Trey.

             TREY THE RA 
      Say hooray!

             MIKE
      Hooray!

FLASH!  Trey takes the photo.  CUT TO an insert of Mikes ID 
card, the top of his head is the only part in the photo.

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
        (is he upset?)
      I cant believe it...
        (thrilled)
      Im officially a college student!!

He joins a freshmen tour group.

             FAY
      Okay everyone, Im Fay and Ill be 
      giving you your orientation tour on 
      this perfect day!

The TOUR GUIDE waves her flag.

Mike is in awe.

INT. SCHOOL OF DOOR TECHNOLOGY

The tour continues.

             FAY
      Here are the labs where students 
      learn to design and build the doors 
      to the human world.

We see a door being processed.

             STUDENTS
        (tour walla)
      Wow...

A Professor swipes their I.D. and enters the work area.

             FAY
      Looks like the professors about to 
      test a door.

A door is activated, and Mike catches a glimpse of a childs 
bedroom.

The tour guide leads Mike and the other freshmen through the 
cafeteria.

             FAY
      The MU cafeteria serves a full 
      buffet, three meals a day.  I 
      personally believe we have some of 
      the best chefs in the world.

We see a student dump food into a trash can.  A food worker 
then picks up the trash can and dumps it back onto the 
buffet.

             STUDENTS
        (walla, in awe)
      Whoa!

The tour guide leads her tour away, leaving Mike alone in awe 
of this famous building.

                                          15.
Mike continues to walk by the tables and an eye appears 
behind him.  He turns and he is eye to eye with another 
monster.

             EYE MONSTER
      Hey there!  Keep your eye on the 
      sky...at the astronomy club.

The Art Club.

A mop-looking monster splashes pink paint over his head, 
covering himself.  He then splatters his head on a canvas, 
creating art while another member begins to play the drums.

The Improv Club.

             IMPROV STUDENT
      Hey, hey, hey!  Come join the 
      Improv Club!  Youll wish you were 
      a...never...always.  Ah, dang it!

Mike passes by with a smile - hes not interested, but loving 
the variety of options, the huge world hes entered.

GREEK COUNCIL table.

             GREEK COUNCIL PRESIDENT
      MUs Greek Council.

Yet again, not for Mike.

Until, just as he passes by...

             GREEK COUNCIL PRESIDENT
	(CONTD)
      We sponsor the annual Scare 
      Games....

That gets Mikes attention.  He stops--

             MIKE
        (stumbling)
      The Scare-what-now?

The Goth Greek Council president and the jock Greek Council 
vice president pass Mike a flyer featuring the games.

             GREEK COUNCIL VP
        (explosive energy)
      The Scare Games: a super-intense 
      scaring competition!

      


                                          16.
             GREEK COUNCIL PRESIDENT
        (ominous, calm)
      Theyre crazy-dangerous, so 
      anything could happen.

             GREEK COUNCIL VP
        (explosive energy)
      A bunch of guys went to the 
      hospital last year!

             GREEK COUNCIL PRESIDENT
        (ominous, calm)
      You could totally die.

             GREEK COUNCIL VP
        (explosive energy)
      And its worth it!  You get a 
      chance to prove that you are the 
      best!

Mike stares down at the flyer, intrigued.

             MIKE
      Cool.

INT. DORM HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

The RA hands Mike a key.

             RA
      Wazowski, room three nineteen; you 
      know your roommate is a scaring 
      major too.

Excited, Mike grabs his keys from the RA and excitedly heads 
off toward his room.

             MIKE
      Hello, Im your roommate.  No, 
      thats too bland.
        (exhale)
      Dont force it.  Just let it 
      happen.  Your lifelong best friend 
      is right behind this door!
        (deep breath)

Mike swings open the door and the monster in his room is... 
RANDY BOGGS.

Randy is hidden in the shadows, then leaps forward with a 
friendly hand outstretched.

      


                                          17.
             RANDY
      Hey there!  Im your roomie.  
      Names Randy Boggs, scaring major!

             MIKE
        (small laugh)
      Mike Wazowski, scaring major.

             RANDY
      I can tell were gonna be best 
      chums, Mike.  Take whichever bed 
      you want - I wanted you to have 
      first dibs!

A student behind Randy drops some boxes.  He disappears.

             RANDY
	(CONTD)
        (startled voc)
      Ah!

Randy reappears.

             MIKE
        (gasp)
      You just disappeared.

             RANDY
      Sorry.
        (growing increasingly 
         agitated)
      If I do that in scaring class, Ill 
      be a joke!

             MIKE
      No, its totally great, you gotta 
      use it.

             RANDY
      Really?

             MIKE
      Yeah, but lose the glasses - they 
      give it away.

Mike heads into the room.  Randy takes off his glasses and 
squints, looking unintentionally evil.

             RANDY
      Huh....
        (squinting voc)

Randy closes the door.

      


INT. MIKE AND RANDYS DORM ROOM
Mike finishes putting the last of his many scaring posters 
up, placing books on a shelf, along with Little Mikey and 
pinning up the Scare Games flyer.

He then consults his checklist.

                                          18.

             MIKE
      Okay, unpack - check.  Hang posters 
      - check.  Now I just need to ace my 
      classes, graduate with honors, and 
      become the greatest scarer ever.

             RANDY
      Boy, I wish I had your confidence, 
      Mike.  Aren't you even a little 
      nervous?

             MIKE
      Actually, no.  Ive been waiting 
      for this my whole life.

Mike holds the MU hat he got from the scarer when he was a 
kid.  He walks toward the window.

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      I just cant wait to get started.

We see the scare school in the distance.

EXT. SCARE SCHOOL - MORNING

The sun rises over the campus, as students make their way to 
class.

GONG!  The bells in the campanile sound the hour, signalling 
the start of the day.

A slug student realizes hes late.

             SLUG
      Oh man!  I cant be late on the 
      first day!

He pumps his arms furiously but doesnt get very far.

                                  CUT TO:

      


                                          19.
EXT. SCHOOL OF SCARING

Mike and Randy head into the School of Scaring with the other 
students.

Students touch a statue as they pass by - an MU superstition.  
Mike has to jump up a little to reach it, but he touches the 
statue too.

INT. SCHOOL OF SCARING

Mike takes in the enormous rotunda-style classroom.

             MIKE
      Wow.

Busts of distinguished scare professors and alumni sit on 
pedestals near the windows.  In front of each one is a scream 
can.

Mike takes a seat, much bigger monsters on either side of 
him.  A couple of them look down at Mike, amused.

             BIG STUDENT #1
        (chuckle)

             BIG STUDENT #2
      You gotta be kidding me....

Randy sits next to Mike.

             RANDY
      Im so nervous....

             MIKE
      Relax, itll be fine.

A large, tough, drill sergeant monster, PROFESSOR KNIGHT, 
addresses the class.

             PROFESSOR KNIGHT
      Good morning students, welcome to 
      scaring 101, I am Professor Knight! 
      Now, Im sure all of you were the 
      scariest monster in your town, well 
      bad news kids, youre in my town 
      now, and I do not scare easily---
        (short scream)

Suddenly a beam of light falls over Professor Knight.

             STUDENTS
        (gasps)

      


                                          20.
He stops and looks up to a now empty window.  A shape flies 
around the room, closing the curtains and lands with a 
clatter behind him.

             STUDENTS
	(CONTD)
        (walla)
      Dean Hardscrabble/Thats really 
      her.

The class watches as a form steps out from the light 
revealing a tall dragon woman with large bat wings, DEAN 
HARDSCRABBLE.

             PROFESSOR KNIGHT
      Dean Hardscrabble.  This is a 
      pleasant surprise.

ON Mike watching Hardscrabble heading across the room, her 
chilling insect legs tapping against the floor.  Mikes smile 
brightens.

             MIKE
        (whispered to Randy)
      Shes a legend; she broke the all 
      time scare record with the scream 
      in that very can.

ON HARDSCRABBLE.  

She adjusts her scream can slightly.

             HARDSCRABBLE
      I dont mean to interrupt, I just 
      thought Id drop by to see the 
      terrifying faces joining my 
      program.

             STUDENTS
        (murmur)

             PROFESSOR KNIGHT
      Well, Im sure my students would 
      love to hear a few words of 
      inspiration.

             HARDSCRABBLE
        (addressing Knight)
      Inspiration?  Very well.

She addresses the class.

             HARDSCRABBLE
	(CONTD)
      Scariness is the true measure of a 
      monster.  


      


                                          21.
             HARDSCRABBLE
	(CONTD)
      If youre not scary, what kind of 
      monster are you?  Its my job to 
      make great students greater, not 
      make mediocre students LESS 
      mediocre. 

The class remains nervous.

             HARDSCRABBLE
	(CONTD)
      That is why at the end of the 
      semester there will be a final 
      exam.  Fail that exam, and you are 
      out of the scaring program.

The class reacts.

             STUDENTS
        (gasps)
      What?

ON MIKE, he looks nervous.

ON HARDSCRABBLE.

             HARDSCRABBLE
      So, I should hope youre all 
      properly inspired.

The Dean flies out of the top of the building.  The class is 
in shock.

             STUDENTS
        (walla)

PROFESSOR KNIGHT, steps forward.

             PROFESSOR KNIGHT
      Alright, alright, who can tell me 
      the properties of an effective 
      roar?

There is a beat, everyone is terrified, then... a familiar 
green arm shoots up in the air.

             PROFESSOR KNIGHT
	(CONTD)
      Yes.

             MIKE
        (catches his breath)
      There are actually five.  Those 
      include the roars resonance, the 
      duration of the roar, and the s-

      


                                          22.
             SULLEY
      RHAARRRR!

A booming roar stops Mike mid-sentence, blowing everyone in 
the room away.  

REVEAL a dishevelled 18-year-old SULLEY, stumbling into 
class, late.

             SULLEY
	(CONTD)
      Whoops, sorry.  I heard someone say 
      roar, so I just kinda went for it.

             STUDENTS
        (chuckling, impressed)

Sulley starts to slide down the row of students, trying not 
to squish people as he goes by.

             SULLEY
        (getting by student)
      Whoops, excuse me, sorry... didnt 
      mean to scare you there...
        (to students)
      Hey, how ya doin.

             PROFESSOR KNIGHT
      Very impressive, Mr...

             SULLEY
        (to the Professor)
      Sullivan.  Jimmy Sullivan.

             PROFESSOR KNIGHT
      Sullivan?  Like Bill Sullivan, the 
      scarer?

             SULLEY
      Yeah, hes my dad.

             STUDENTS
        (impressed walla)
      No way, whoa!

             BIG STUDENT #1
      Hes a Sullivan....

             PROFESSOR KNIGHT
      I shouldve known.  I expect big 
      things from you.

Sulley reaches his seat and looks back to the professor 
confidently.

      


                                          23.
             SULLEY
      Well, you wont be disappointed.

Mike interrupts.

             MIKE
      Uh, Im sorry, should I keep going?

             PROFESSOR KNIGHT
      No, no, Mr. Sullivans covered it.

Sulley shoots two finger pistols at the Professor.

             PROFESSOR KNIGHT
	(CONTD)
        (laugh)
      Everyone take out your scaring 
      textbooks and open them to chapter 
      one....

Mike sits down, his moment stolen.  

             SULLEY
      Hey bub.  Could I borrow a pencil?  
      I forgot all my stuff.

A student hands Sulley a pencil.

             SULLEY
	(CONTD)
        (picking his teeth)
      Yeah, there we go...thatll get it.

Mike is annoyed.

INT. MIKE AND RANDYS ROOM

Mike pins up his calendar, covering the Scare Games flyer.

             RANDY
      Come on Mike- its a fraternity and 
      sorority party.  We have to go!

Mike flips to December and marks the date for the scaring 
final.

             MIKE
      We flunk that scaring final, we are 
      done.  Im not taking any chances.

Mike goes back to September and crosses out the first day of 
school.

      


                                          24.
             RANDY
      Weve got the whole semester to 
      study, but this might be our only 
      chance to get in good with the cool 
      kids.  Thats why I made these 
      cupcakes.

Randy holds up cupcakes that say spell out BE MY dAL.

Randy notices the mistake then turns the cupcake to read 
PAL."

             RANDY
	(CONTD)
      Oops.  That could have been 
      embarrassing.

Mike is too excited about studying to party.

             MIKE
      When Im a scarer, life will be a 
      nonstop party.  Stay outta trouble, 
      wild man!

Randy giggles and heads out, closing the door behind him.

             RANDY
        (giggling)
      Wild man...

Mike laughs to himself.

He gets to work, opening his scaring book.

A strange noise draws his attention to the window.  He looks 
back to the window when a strange pig-faced monster animal 
suddenly pops up and stares him in the face.

             MIKE
      What the-?

Suddenly the pig is pushed through the window and into Mikes 
room.

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      Ah!

The pig starts running all over the room.  Then a big blue 
hand rises into view and grabs the windowsill.

             SULLEY
        (pulling up efforts)
      ARCHIE!

      


                                          25.
             MIKE
      AH!

             SULLEY
      AH!

With a grunt, Sulley falls into the room.

Sulley lands with a thud on the floor.  The pig runs over his 
stomach and underneath the bed.

             MIKE
      Hey!  What are you--

             SULLEY
      Shhhh.  Shh, shh, shh, shh.

Sulley ducks down under the window.  Mike hops down from the 
chair.

Mike is shocked that hes been shushed.

             MIKE
      Wait, youre shushing me?!  Hey, 
      hey, you cant--

Sulley puts a hand to Mikes mouth, silencing him.

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
        (fingers in his mouth)
      --shushme.

Sulley looks out the window.

SULLEYS POV: FOUR BIG FEAR TECH MONSTERS (in letterman 
jackets) run by, scanning the campus.

             FEAR TECH MONSTER #1
      Whered he go?!

             FEAR TECH MONSTER #2
      Hes dead meat!

             FEAR TECH MONSTER #3
      That guy's in big trouble!

             FEAR TECH MONSTER #1
      Yeah, he is.

             FEAR TECH MONSTER #4
      Hey guys, over here!

ON SULLEY who waits until theyre out of sight, then laughs.

      


                                          26.
             SULLEY
        (laughing)
      Fear Tech dummies.

             MIKE
        (muffled)
      Unghhhr!!

REVEAL Mike, Sulleys hand still clamped over his mouth.

             SULLEY
      Oh, sorry about that, buddy.

Sulley releases Mike.

             MIKE
        (gasping)
      Why are you in my room?!

Sulley looks around the room.

             SULLEY
      Your room?  This is my...this is 
      not my room.
        (then)
      Archie?  Come here, boy!

             MIKE
      Archie?

Sulley kneels down trying to grab Archie from under the bed.

             SULLEY
      Archie the Scare Pig, hes Fear 
      Techs mascot.

             MIKE
      Why is it here?!

             SULLEY
        (laughing)
      I stole it!  Gonna take it to the 
      RORs.

             MIKE
      The what?

             SULLEY
        (bragging)
      Roar Omega Roar?  THE top 
      fraternity on campus?  They only 
      accept the highly elite.
        (bragging)

      


                                          27.
             SULLEY
	(CONT'D)
      Okay, Ill lift the bed, you grab 
      the pig.  Ready?

             MIKE
      What?  No, no, ah....

             SULLEY
        (fast)
      One, two, three!

Sulley lifts the bed with one hand and shoves Mike under with 
the other.

The bed bumps and bucks as Archie and Mike struggle 
underneath.

             SULLEY
	(CONTD)
      Dont let go!  Careful, hes a 
      biter!

A CHOMP sound.

             MIKE
        (pained)
      Ahhh!

Suddenly Archie darts from under the bed, yanking a battered 
Mike behind him.

Archie jumps on Sulley and runs all over him.

Sulley falls as Archie leaps to the bookcase.

Sulley climbs Mikes bookshelf to get Archie.

             SULLEY
      I got 'em.

The bookshelf comes crashing down, everything falling onto 
Sulley.

             SULLEY
	(CONTD)
      Uh oh.  Whoa!
        (falling then laughing)
      That was awesome!  What am I doing?  
      James P. Sullivan.

             MIKE
      Mike Wazowski.

Mike tries to show Sulley to the door.

      


                                          28.
             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      Listen, it was quite delightful 
      meeting you and whatever that is, 
      but if you dont mind I have to 
      study my scaring!

             SULLEY
      Pssh, you dont need to study 
      scaring, you just do it.

             MIKE
      Really?  I think theres a little 
      more to it than that.  But hey, 
      thanks for stopping by---

Archie jumps down off the desk with Mikes MU hat in his 
mouth.

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
        (to Archie)
      Ah!  Let go of that!

Mike lunges for Archie, but Archie leaps out the window.

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      My hat!

             SULLEY
      My pig!

EXT. CAMPUS

Sulley dashes out of the dorm first, slamming the door in 
Mikes face.

                                  CUT TO:

The chase continues....

             SULLEY
      Hey, come here-
        (laugh)

             MIKE
        (running efforts)
      Hey!  Catch it....Come back here! 

Sulley is having a blast.  Mike leaps on to Archie, but 
Archie keeps running, now with Mike on top of him.

             SULLEY
      Yeah!  Ride it to Frat Row!

      


                                          29.
ON Mike as he tries desperately to steer Archie through 
campus.

ON a portentous monster who is playing guitar for a group of 
girls.

             GUITAR MONSTER
      Tentacles and serpents' wings they--

Mike and Sulley burst through disrupting the song.

INT. FRAT ROW - CONTINUOUS

RUSH WEEK.  Archie runs toward frat row with Mike still on 
his back.  Sulley follows.

             MIKE
        (riding vocs)
      WHOOOAAAA...

             SULLEY
      WHOOOOOOOOO!

             MIKE
        (breaths)
      WOW!

Archie runs right through a fraternity house party.

INT. FRATERNITY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Mike and Sulley head into the party and barrel through.  A 
student hangs from the ceiling, having a great time.

             STUDENT
        (swinging vocs)
      Woo hoo!

Mike is barely hanging on to Archie as he runs through a 
living room.  They enter a game room, Mike tumbles across a 
table and lands right back onto Archie.

Sulley jumps over the table but crushes it and grabs a piece 
of pizza on his way.

Mike comes out of the party and runs right into Randy, who's 
holding out cupcakes.

             RANDY
      Cupcake?

      


                                          30.
             MIKE
      AH!

             RANDY
      ACH!

The cupcakes rain down on Randy's head.  Sulley runs past and 
jumps over a railing.

EXT. FRATERNITY HOUSE

Mike rides Archie through a dance party.

He collides with a guy playing football and falls off the 
pig.

             FOOTBALL STUDENT
        (impact voc)
      Hey!

Sulley leaps over Mike as he's down and continues after 
Archie.

Mike sees a trash can at the end of a line of bikes.  He 
grabs the football and aims for the bikes....

Sulley almost reaches Archie and dives for him, but misses.

The bikes fall over like dominoes, knocking the trash can and 
rolling it around just in time to catch Archie as he runs by.

             MIKE
      Got it!

Mike picks up the pig and grabs the hat, beaming.

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      Ha ha!
        (being picked up vocs)
      Woohoo!

Just then, Sulley grabs both of them and hoists them into the 
air, like a trophy.

             SULLEY
      Fear Techs mascot!  MU rules!!

Cheers erupt as MU students notice Mike and Sulley with 
Archie.

             CROWD
        (walla)
      Yeah!

      


                                          31.
Sulley puts Mike down and the crowd surrounds them,  
congratulating them.  Mike grabs his hat.  Sulley hands the 
pig to a group of students who slap a MU sticker over his 
Fear Tech saddle.

For Mike, who was annoyed to be on this wild pig chase, the 
adulation of the crowd changes things.  He soaks it up, 
happily surprised.

             CROWD
	(CONTD)
        (chanting)
      MU!  MU!  MU!

The JOX, and another fraternity approach the two of them.

             BIG RED 
      Did you see him catch that pig?!  
      You are Jaws Theta Chi material, 
      freshman!

             MIKE
      Well, thanks, I didnt know the--

The fraternity brothers walk right past Mike to Sulley.

             FRAT BROTHER
      No, no, no, hes an Omega Howl guy.

             BIG RED 
      Back off, we saw him first.

             FRAT BROTHER
      No way, we did!

Mike notices theyre fighting over Sulley, when suddenly a 
voice calls out.

             JOHNNY
	 (O.S.)
      Ill take it from here, gentlemen!

Everyone turns to see a huge monster with large horns and a 
protruding lower jaw flanked with terrifying fangs: JOHNNY. 
He steps forward parting the crowd.  Johnny and his gang wear 
letterman jackets that read ROR.

             STUDENTS
        (sotto, impressed)
      The RORs...

Johnny approaches Sulley.

      


                                          32.
             JOHNNY
      Johnny Worthington, president of 
      Roar Omega Roar.  Whats your name 
      Big Blue?

The other fraternities slink away.

             SULLEY
      Jimmy Sullivan, friends call me 
      Sulley.

Sulley reacts pleasantly surprised.

             CHET
      This guys a SULLIVAN!  Like the 
      famous Sullivan!  I cant believe 
      it!  That is crazy....
        (laugh)

             JOHNNY
        (dead pan)
      Chet, calm down.

             CHET
        (cowering)
      Im sorry.

             JOHNNY
      Sulley, any freshman with the guts 
      to pull off a stunt like that has 
      got future scarer written all 
      over him.

Sulleys swept toward the ROR house, following after Johnny, 
and the ROR brothers.  Mike follows after him.

             MIKE
        (chuckle, wanting to join 
         in)
      Hey, did you see me ride the pig, 
      that took guts....

Mike is stopped by one of Johnnys thugs.

             CHET
      Slow down Squirt, this party is for 
      scare students only.

Johnny leans down to Mikes level.

      


                                          33.
             JOHNNY
      Oh, sorry Killer, but you might 
      want to hang out with someone a 
      little more your speed.  They look 
      fun!

Johnny points to Oozma Kappa; a group of loser monsters 
standing by a table that says Oozma Kappa.  Its covered with  
balloons and cake.

             DON
      Oh hey dere!  Wanna join Oozma 
      Kappa?!

             SQUISHY
      We have cake!

A monster eats the entire cake in one bite.

A balloon deflates and lands on Squishys face.

             JOHNNY
        (condescending)
      Go crazy.

Johnny starts to walk away....

Mike is stunned.  He cant be serious.

             MIKE
      Is that a joke?

Johnny stops, annoyed.

             JOHNNY
        (annoyed sigh)
      Sulley, talk to your friend.

Johnny looks to Sulley with a pained smile.

Sulley looks back and forth between the cool RORs and Mike.

             SULLEY
        (to Johnny)
      Well, hes not really my friend, 
      but sure...
        (to Mike)
      You heard him, this is a party for 
      scare students.

             MIKE
      I AM a scare student!

      


                                          34.
             SULLEY
      I mean, for scare students who 
      actually, you know, have a chance.

Burn, the ROR brothers laugh.  This stops Mike, his eye 
narrows.  

             CHET
      AH, snap!

             MIKE
      My chances are just as good as 
      yours.

Sulley gets embarrassed, frustrated.

             SULLEY
      Youre not even in the same league 
      with me.

             MIKE
      Just wait hot shot, I'm gonna scare 
      circles around you this year.

Sulley looks surprised, and a little embarrassed to be called 
out in front of the RORs, but he laughs it off.

             SULLEY
        (laughing)
      Okay, Id like to see that.

             MIKE
      Oh dont worry...
        (to himself putting his 
         hat on and walking away)
      You will.

In the BG, the RORs put their arms around Sulley and usher 
him into the fraternity house.

             SULLEY

He surveys the students and comes to Sulley.

             PROFESSOR KNIGHT
      Now here is a monster who looks 
      like a scarer!

Mike looks over to Sulley....Sulley looks back, points finger 
pistols at Mike.

Mike, frustrated, turns back into the position with even more 
gusto.

             PROFESSOR KNIGHT

Mike pulls a book off the shelf and adds it to a stack of 
books he is carrying.  He grabs another book as he keeps 
walking.

He climbs a ladder to grab a book on the top shelf and adds 
it to his very tall stack.  He grabs another book out from

the mouth of a sleeping monster with a tic-tac-toe grid on 
his chest.

Sulleys ball wins the game.

A player catches a football, then a bigger player picks him 
up, then a GIANT player picks them up and runs through the 
field trampling every player.

Pandemonium in the stands.  Sulley and his ROR friends CHEER.  
PAN DOWN to Mike and Randy in the stands.  Mike studies his 
scaring textbook, oblivious to the game and cheering around 
him.

A drink falls on Mike and he looks up from his book.  But 
then goes back to his book as the crowd cheers again.

      Thats what Im sayin!

             SULLEY 
        (to the RORs)
      Im gonna wipe the floor with that 
      little know-it-all.

Johnny puts his arm on Sulleys shoulder.

      Yes you are, Big Blue.

Johnny removes Sulleys ROR jacket.  Sulleys confused.

             SULLEY
      Hey, wait, what are you-?

             JOHNNY
      Its just a precaution.  RORs are 
      the best scarers on campus, 
      Sullivan.  Cant have a member 
      getting shown up by a beach ball.

Johnny and Sulley look toward Mike as he enters the School of

      Todays final will judge your 
      ability to assess a childs fear, 
      and perform the appropriate 
      scare...in the scare simulator.

ON THE SIMULATOR - a simulated human childs bedroom, 
complete with robotic child, much more low tech then well 
see in Monsters, Inc.

ON THE STUDENTS - staring at the simulator, nervous.

ON KNIGHT - lifting the settings on the simulator to medium.

             PROFESSOR KNIGHT
	(CONTD)
      The childs sensitivity level will 
      be raised from bed-wetter to heavy 
      sleeper.  So give it everything 
      youve got.

for his exam to start.

      


             PROFESSOR KNIGHT      I am a 5-year-old girl afraid of 
      spiders and Santa Claus.  Which 
      scare do you use?

Dean Hardscrabble flies from the floor up to the window.  The

The next student steps up.

ON MIKE who forces himself to stop watching the tests.

little guy is the first person to ever make him second-guess 
his scaring abilities.

Sulley turns back to Mike confidently, but its all for show - 
Mike has gotten under his skin.

      Hey, do you mind?

             SULLEY
      Dont mind at all.

Sulley starts warming up, obnoxiously, right by Mike.

             SULLEY
	(CONTD)
        (quietly)
      Roar!  Grr!!  Arr!

Mike shoots daggers at Sulley.

             RANDY
      Cmon Mike, lets just move.

Mike jumps down near Sulley and picks up his books.

             MIKE
      Stay outta my way.  Unlike you, I 
      had to work hard to get into the 
      scare program.

             SULLEY
      Thats because you dont belong 
      here.

             MIKE
        (beat)
      Rahr!

Sulley is surprised but he roars back.

             SULLEY
      Roar!
        (laugh, to himself)
      Thats what I thought....

Sulley goes back to practicing as Mikes cocky smile melts.  
His words have gotten under Mikes skin.

      


                                          45.
             SULLEY
	(CONTD)
        (quietly)
      Roar!  Roar!  Roar!  Roar!  Roar!  
      Roar!  Roar!  Roar!  Roar!  Roar!

Mike gets into Sulleys face and starts practicing his scares 
too.

             MIKE
        (quietly)
      Roar!  Roar!  Roar!  Roar!  Roar!  
      Roar!  Roar!  Roar!  Roar!  Roar!

Sulley keeps doing the same scare move.  With every lunge, 
Mike does a different move.

Other students start to take notice of the guys.

Randy looks up at Hardscrabble, concerned.  He sees that 
Hardscrabble is taking notice....

Mike and Sulley get closer and closer to one another and then 
Sulley steps back, tripping on the books.

             SULLEY
        (stumbling back vocs)
      Whoa-

Sulley stumbles back and bumps into the stand holding 
Hardscrabbles scream can.  It starts wobbling....

The can wobbles strongly then falls.

Theres a beat - then it appears to be undamaged.  Whew- 
theyre safe.

Suddenly, the scream is released, sending the can spinning 
around the room!  Students have to duck out of the way as it 
flies back and forth.

It finally lands in front of Mike and Sulley, emptying 
completely.

Suddenly a huge, dark figure lands in front of them, wings 
outstretched.  Mike and Sulley come face to face with Dean 
Hardscrabble.  She picks up her empty scream can.

Randy looks from Mike and Sulley to Hardscrabble, then blends 
himself invisible.

             MIKE
      Im so sorry.

      


                                          46.
             SULLEY
      It was an accident.

             HARDSCRABBLE
      What, this?  My one souvenir from a 
      lifetime of scaring?  Accidents 
      happen dont they?  The important 
      thing is: no one got hurt.

             MIKE
      Youre taking this remarkably well.

             HARDSCRABBLE
      Now, lets continue the exams.
        (to Mike)
      Mr. Wazowski, Im a 5-year-old  
      girl on a farm in Kansas afraid of 
      lightning.  Which scare do you use?

Mike looks around confused, why is she taking over?

             MIKE
      Shouldnt I go up on the--

             HARDSCRABBLE
        (leaning in)
      Which scare do you use?

             MIKE
      That is a shadow approach with a 
      crackle holler.

             HARDSCRABBLE
      Demonstrate.

Mike moves through the steps of the scare deliberately.

He takes a deep breath, preparing to scare when:

             HARDSCRABBLE
	(CONTD)
      Stop!  Thank you.

             MIKE
      But I didnt get to sh--

             HARDSCRABBLE
      Ive seen enough.

Hardscrabble turns to Sulley.

             HARDSCRABBLE
	(CONTD)
      Im a 7-year-old boy--

      


Sulley steps forward and ROARS ferociously.  Hardscrabble is unimpressed.

                                          47.

             SULLEY
        (interrupting)
      ROAR!

             HARDSCRABBLE
      I wasnt finished.

             SULLEY
      I dont need to know any of that 
      stuff to scare.

             HARDSCRABBLE
      That "stuff" would have informed 
      you that this particular child is 
      afraid of snakes.  So a roar 
      wouldnt make him scream, it would 
      make him cry, alerting his parents, 
      exposing the monster world, 
      destroying life as we know it, and 
      of course, we cant have that, so 
      Im afraid I can not recommend that 
      you continue in the scaring 
      program, good day.

             SULLEY
        (laughing, then it dawns 
         on him)
      Wait, what?  But Im a Sullivan.

             HARDSCRABBLE
        (smiling)
      Well then, Im sure your family 
      will be very disappointed.

Sulley is incredulous, confused.  He looks up into the 
stands, just in time to see the door swing shut on Johnny and 
the RORs as they exit.

Sulley cant believe this is happening.

He turns to Mike and stares at him with pure hate and then 
marches off.

Mike watches Sulley leave, concerned.

             HARDSCRABBLE
	(CONTD)
      And Mr. Wazowski, what you lack is 
      something that cannot be taught, 
      youre not scary.

Mike stands there, stunned.

      


                                          48.
             HARDSCRABBLE
	(CONTD)
      You will not be continuing in the 
      scaring program.

             MIKE
      Please, let me try the simulator, 
      Ill surprise you.

             HARDSCRABBLE
      Surprise me?  I doubt that very 
      much.

                            SMASH TO BLACK.

FADE UP FROM BLACK

EXT. ESTABLISHING SHOT

Time lapse: Barely any leaves are on the trees.

INT. CAN DESIGN CLASS - DAY

ON A BORING PROFESSOR, Professor Brandywine.  REVEAL Mike 
sitting in class, pained to be there.  He stares out the 
window at the School of Scaring in the distance.

Beat.

             PROFESSOR BRANDYWINE
      Welcome back, I hope everyone had a 
      pleasant break.  Some say that a 
      career as a scream can designer is 
      boring, unchallenging, a waste of a 
      monsters potential....

             PROFESSOR BRANDYWINE
	(CONTD)
        (inhale)
      Open your textbooks to chapter 
      three.  We will now plunge into the 
      rich history of scream can design.

Mike looks over to Sulley who is glaring at him.  Sulley 
squeezes his scream can in frustration at Mike, and Mike 
glares back at him.

      


                                          49.
EXT. QUAD

Mike emerges from class, dejected.  He heads toward his dorm.

We pull out and reveal that Sulley is walking next to him, 
still glaring....Mike pays no attention.

Sulley stops and watches Mike walk off ahead of him.

INT. MIKES DORM ROOM

Mike slowly walks into his room, depressed, shutting the 
world out.

He stands by his bed and stares at his MU hat, then looks out 
the window at the School of Scaring across the quad.  His 
heart breaks.

He looks down at his lame scream can tech book.  His 
frustration boils and he throws the book against the wall.

The book knocks down his calendar revealing the Scare Games 
poster.  Mikes brow raises and a smile slowly grows across 
his face.  He quickly tears the poster off the wall.

INT. FRESHMEN DORM HALLWAY

Mike opens his door and Sulley is standing there, still 
glaring.  Mike smiles.

             MIKE 
        (excited breaths)
      Out of my way!

Mike rushes down the hall with his poster, determined!

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      Coming through!
        (bumping into a student)
      Oops, sorry!  Ha ha!

Sulley stares at Mike, whats gotten into him?

EXT. FRAT ROW

The Greek Scare Games kickoff.

Fraternity and sorority monsters have gathered for the event.  
The Greek Council president and VP are on stage to address 
the crowd.

      


             GREEK COUNCIL PRESIDENT      Welcome to this years Greek Scare 
      Games kickoff!

The over-excited vice president leans into his mic and yells 
to the crowd.

                                          50.

             GREEK COUNCIL VP
      THE SCARE GAMES!  YAH!!!

             GREEK COUNCIL PRESIDENT
      Okay, relax.  We have a special 
      guest, the founder of the Games - 
      Dean Hardscrabble!

More cheers as Dean Hardscrabble steps to the podium.

             HARDSCRABBLE
      Good afternoon.  As a student I 
      created these games as a friendly 
      competition.  But be prepared:  To 
      take home the trophy you must be 
      the most fearsome monsters on 
      campus.

Instantly posing, a student photographer snaps a picture of 
the RORs.

             HARDSCRABBLE
	(CONTD)
      So good luck, and may the best 
      monsters win!

Hardscrabble leaves the stage.

             GREEK COUNCIL VP
      Alright everybody, were closing 
      down sign-ups, so well see you all-

             MIKE
      Wait!

Mike pushes through the crowd.

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      Im signing up.

The crowd, especially the RORs, bust out laughing.

             JOHNNY
        (laughing)
      What?!

ON PROFESSOR HARDSCRABBLE who narrows her eyes.  Whats 
Wazowski up to?  

      


                                          51.
Sulley shows up, still angry, looking for Mike.

             GREEK COUNCIL PRESIDENT
      Uhhh, you have to be in a 
      fraternity to compete.

             MIKE
      Behold, the next winning fraternity 
      of the Scare Games... the brothers, 
      my brothers, of Oozma Kappa!

Mike points, revealing the members of the misfit fraternity: 
Don, Terri and Terry, Squishy, and Art.  Theyre not used to 
having so many eyes on them, but they stand proud.

             SQUISHY
      Hi.

A balloon deflates on Squishys head.  The crowd snickers.

Hardscrabble approaches Mike.

             HARDSCRABBLE
      Mr. Wazowski, what are you doing?

             MIKE
      You just said the winners are the 
      most fearsome monsters on campus.  
      If I win, it means you kicked out 
      the best scarer in the whole 
      school.

             HARDSCRABBLE
      That wont happen.

             MIKE
      How about a little wager?

             STUDENTS
        (shocked gasp)

             MIKE
      If I win, you let me back in the 
      scaring program.

ON SULLEY

             SULLEY
        (rolling his eyes)
      Pfft...

             HARDSCRABBLE
      And what would that prove?

      


                                          52.
             MIKE
      That you were wrong.

             STUDENTS
        (shocked laughs)

             HARDSCRABBLE
      Very well, if you win I will let 
      your entire team into the scare 
      program, but if you lose, you will 
      leave Monsters University.

Mike struggles with this and then...

             MIKE
      Deal.

             HARDSCRABBLE
        (smiling)
      Now all you need to do is find 
      enough members to compete.

Mike turns to the misfits.

             MIKE
      We need six guys, right?

             GREEK COUNCIL VP
      Sorry chief, we count bodies, not 
      heads.
        (pointing to Terri and 
         Terry)
      That dude counts as one.

Terri and Terry look at each other.

Mikes in a panic.

             MIKE
        (frantic)
      Anybody else wanna join our team?!  
      Anyone at all?

             RANDY
      Excuse me.  Sorry, Im late.  Can I 
      just squeeze by-

Mike suddenly spots Randy in the crowd.

             MIKE
      Randy!  Randy, thank goodness, I 
      need you on my team!

      


                                          53.
             RANDY
      Oh sorry, Im already on a team.

Johnny calls over, annoyed.

             JOHNNY
      Boggs!

Randy looks conflicted, nervous.  He reveals his fraternity 
affiliation....

             RANDY
      Im finally in with the cool kids 
      Mike, DONT blow this for me!

He crosses to stand near the RORs.

             JOHNNY
      Do the thing.

With a pained smile - Randys thrilled to be a ROR, but isnt 
exactly one of the guys - Randy camouflages.  Pleased, Johnny 
chuckles.

             CHET
        (mock surprise)
      Oh, where did he go?
        (laughing)

             ROR BROTHERS
        (laughing)

             MIKE
      Please anybody!  I need one more 
      monster.  Just one more!

ON PRESIDENT.

             GREEK COUNCIL PRESIDENT
        (to Mike)
      Yeah sorry, doesnt look good.  We 
      have to move on.  Your team doesnt 
      qualify.

             SULLEY
      Yes it does.

Sulley climbs on the car that Mike is standing on.

             SULLEY
	(CONTD)
      The star player has just arrived.

Mikes eye goes wide.

      


                                          54.
             MIKE
      No way!
        (to the crowd)
      Someone else, please anyone else!

             GREEK COUNCIL PRESIDENT
      Were shutting down sign-ups, okay.  
      Is he on your team or not?

Sulley smiles at Mike, cocky.

             CROWD MEMBER
      Come on, lets go!

             MIKE
        (steaming)
      Fine!  Yes, hes on my team.

Hardscrabble smiles a chilling smile.

             HARDSCRABBLE
      Good luck.

Hardscrabble walks off.

             SULLEY
      Alright Wazowski, whats the plan?

EXT. OOZMA KAPPA FRATERNITY HOUSE

REVEAL: OOZMA KAPPA FRATERNITY HOUSE, a quaint little house.

ON Sulley and Mike looking confused by this place.

             SULLEY 
      This is a fraternity house?

The door swings open, revealing DON CARLTON.

             DON
      Hey there, teammateys! Come on 
      aboard!

INT. OOZMA KAPPA FRATERNITY HOUSE.

Don ushers Sulley and Mike inside. 

      


             DON      As the president of Oozma Kappa, it 
      is my honor to welcome you to your 
      new home!

Mike and Sulley step inside a very underwhelming house, where 
they find their new fraternity brothers waiting.

                                          55.

             SQUISHY
      We call this room, Party Central.

It looks like an old ladys house.

             TERRY
      Technically, we havent actually 
      had a party here yet.

             TERRI
      But when we do, well be ready.

Terri presses a remote and a disco ball drops from the 
ceiling on a cord.  The cord snaps and the disco ball smashes 
onto the floor.

INT. OOZMA KAPPA LIVING ROOM

Everyone is mingling.

             DON
      Whoo!  Hot cocoa train is coming 
      through.  Whoa...next stop...You!

Don hands Mike a drink.

Mike begins to address the room.

             MIKE
      I would like to start us off first 
      by -

             SULLEY
        (interrupting)
      So...you guys are scaring majors?

Sulley stands near a cabinet looking at the dainty old lady 
objects.

             DON
        (laugh)
      We were.  None of us lasted very 
      long.  I guess we just werent what 
      old Hardscrabble was looking for.

      


                                          56.
             DON
	(CONT'D)
        (hands Sulley a business 
         card)
      ...Don Carlton, mature student. 
      Thirty years in the textile 
      industry and then ol dandy Don got 
      downsized.  Figured I could throw 
      myself a pity party or go back to 
      school and learn the computers.

Mike and Sulley turn to the cheery two-headed monster.

             TERRY
      Hello, Im Terry with a Y!

             TERRI 
      And Im Terri with an I.  Im a 
      dance major!

             TERRY
      And Im not.

             TERRI
      5 6 7 8, do, do, do, do, 7 8, TURN!  
      And turn....why didnt you turn?

             TERRY
        (lowered voice)
      Because we never agreed to do this.

             TERRI
      You said this was gonna be cool.

             TERRY
      No one said this was gonna be cool.

             TERRI
      Now Im embarrassed.

             TERRY
      NOW youre embarrassed?

             TERRI
      Yes, because its in front of 
      people.

             TERRY
      You should wake up embarrassed!

Next, its Arts turn - big, burly, but with a sensitive side.

             ART
        (gruff)
      Hey!  Im Art. New Age Philosophy 
      major.   


      


                                          57.
             ART
	(CONT'D)
      Excited to live with you, and laugh 
      with you, and cry with you.

He hands them each a journal.

             ART
	(CONTD)
      Thought you might like to keep a 
      dream journal.

Suddenly, Squishy pops up right behind Sulley.

             SQUISHY
      Guess that leaves me.

Squishy gives Sulley a start - where did that little guy come 
from?  Squishy walks around in front of Sulley and takes a 
seat.

             SQUISHY
	(CONTD)
      My names Scott Squibbles.  My 
      friends call me Squishy.  Im 
      undeclared, unattached and...
        (losing steam)
      ...unwelcome pretty much  
      everywhere but here.

Mike tries to take control again.

             MIKE
      Well, now that weve all been 
      introduced, as captain of our team-

             SULLEY
        (interrupting again)
      So basically you guys have no 
      scaring experience?

             MISFITS
        (laughing)

             SQUISHY
        (chuckling)
      Not a lot!  But now weve got you!

             DON
      Youre about the scariest feller 
      Ive ever seen - even with them 
      pink polka dots.

             SULLEY
        (blushing, laughing)
      Aw, thanks.

      


             MIKE      Well actually, I think I bring the 
      whole package--

Squishy grabs Sulleys hand and holds it up to his face.

                                          58.

             SQUISHY
      Your hands are as big as my face!

             TERRI
      Hes like a mountain, with fur!

             SULLEY
        (Awe shucks)
      Awe come on, I dont even work out!

             ART
      Yeah, me neither.
        (to Mike)
      I dont wanna get too big.
        (sniff)

             DON
        (laughing)
      We thought our dreams were over, 
      but Mike said if we win, theyre 
      letting us in the scaring program!

             TERRI/TERRY
      Were gonna be real scarers!

             MISFITS
      The best!/Yeah, we are!/You betcha!

ON MIKE AND SULLEY as Sulley gives a confused, awkward 
humoring nod.

             SULLEY
        (humoring nod)
      Yeah, right...

Sulley looks over to Mike and shoots him a suspicious look. 
Mike just smiles and nods.

                                  CUT TO:

INT. MIKE AND SULLEYS FRATERNITY ROOM

The guys enter a dark room, where Don flips a switch to turn 
on the light.

      


                                          59.
             DON
      And heres what youve been waitin 
      for, fellas, your very own Oozma 
      Kappa bedroom.

Its a very small room with bunk beds.

             SULLEY
        (chuckling, incredulous, 
         as in this should be 
         interesting)
      Ah great, were sharing this room?

             DON
      Well let you guys get settled.  
      Anything you need, you just give a 
      big holleroony!

Don shuts the door, leaving Mike and Sulley alone in the room 
together.

             SULLEY
      Okay, thanks buddy...
        (quickly to Mike)
      Are you kidding me?

             MIKE
      Look, they dont need to be good.  
      Im gonna carry the whole team.

             SULLEY
      Really?  And whos gonna carry you?

Mike stares at Sulley, furious.

             MIKE
      Hey, you wanna go back to can 
      design, you know where the door is.

Suddenly, the lights go out in the room.  Sulley flicks the 
switch.  Nothing.

             SULLEY
      Great.

INT. OOZMA KAPPA FRATERNITY HOUSE

Mike and Sulley feel their way through the darkened house.

             MIKE
      Guys?  Anybody home?

      


                                          60.
Suddenly a door CREAKS open revealing a stairwell leading 
down.

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      Um, hello?  Fellas?

INT. OOZMA KAPPA BASEMENT - NIGHT

Mike and Sulley step down into the basement.  One candle is 
lit in the middle of the room.

A ROBED MONSTER (Don) suddenly steps from the shadows.

             DON
      Do you pledge your souls to the 
      Oozma Kappa brotherhood?!

A robed Terri and Terry step out from the shadows.

Terry whacks Mike on the butt with a paddle.

             MIKE
      Ow!

             TERRY
      Do you swear to keep secret-

             TERRI
      All that you learn here?

             ART
      No matter how horrifying!

Squishy whacks Sulley on the butt with a paddle.

             SULLEY
      Hey!

A robed Squishy rises from the shadows, paddle in hand.

             SQUISHY
      Will you take the sacred oath of 
      the S--

Suddenly, a super-bright light comes on, flooding the 
basement in light.   A middle-aged monster mom comes down the 
stairs carrying a basket of laundry.

             MISFITS
        (bright light reaction)
      Whoa!/Hey, for crying out loud.

      


                                          61.
             MS. SQUIBBLES
      Sweetie, turn the lights on while 
      youre down here.  Youre going to 
      ruin your eyes.

             SQUISHY
      Mom, were doing an initiation!

             MS. SQUIBBLES
      Oh scary!  Well, carry on, just 
      pretend Im not here.

             SQUISHY
      This is my moms house.

Squishy tries to pretend shes not there.

             SQUISHY
	(CONTD)
      Do you promise to look out for your 
      brothers, no matter what the 
      peril....

Ms. Squibbles goes about her business, turning on both the 
washer and the dryer.  The noise gets much louder.

             SQUISHY
	(CONTD)
        (louder)
      ...will you defend Oozma Kappa, no 
      matter how dangerous, no matter how 
      insurmountable the odds may be? 
      From evils - both great and small - 
      in the face of unending pain and--
        (then, giving up)
      Oh, forget it.  Youre in.

The brothers of Oozma Kappa crowd around Mike and Sulley.

             DON
      Look, we know were no ones first 
      choice for a fraternity.  So it 
      means a lot to have you here with 
      us.

             SQUISHY
      Cant wait to start scaring with 
      you, brothers!

Squishy offers them each an Oozma Kappa baseball hat.

Mike puts it on then looks to Sulley - is he in or out?  A 
beat, then Sulley reluctantly puts on the hat.  Its way 
small for his giant head.

The fraternity brothers cheer!

      


Terry whacks Sulley on the butt again with the paddle.
Sulley snatches the paddle away and snaps it in half.  Terri 
and Terry scurry away.

The misfits head off.

                                          62.

             SQUISHY
	(CONTD)
      Time for a celebration!  Grab the 
      couch cushions, gentlemen, cuz 
      were building a fort!

             MISFITS
        (cheering walla)
      Yeah!

             SQUISHY
      Mom!  Can we stay up late tonight?!

INT. OOZMA KAPPA, MIKE AND SULLEYS ROOM - MORNING

The sun is just coming up as Mike sleeps in bed.  He rolls 
over, right into a blue furry hand.  He cuddles into the hand 
for a beat.

PANNING WIDE we see that Sulleys arm is flopped out of his 
top bunk.  Its so long it reaches down onto Mikes bed.

             MIKE
        (snoring, murmuring)
      I know youre a princess and Im 
      just a stable boy-

Mike cuddles TENDERLY with the hand for another moment, then 
the alarm goes off.  His eye opens, and he sees Sulleys 
hand.

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
        (cuddling noises, then)
      ACCHHHH!

He pushes the hand away, flipping a sleeping Sulley out of 
the top bunk.  BAM!  Sulley lands on the floor, then pops up 
angrily.

             SULLEY
        (impact effort)
      What?!  Mom!
        (looking to Mike)
      What are you doing?!

      


                                          63.
             MIKE
      Your grubby paw was in my bed!

             SULLEY
        (flustered)
      Were you kissing my hand?

             MIKE
        (big laugh)
      No!  And what about you with all 
      your shedding!

             SULLEY
      I dont shed.

             MIKE
      Really?

Mike punches the bottom of Sulleys mattress, and blue hair 
comes cascading down off the mattress.

Sulley tries pushing past Mike, as Mike gets out of bed.  
Mike tries to go around Sulley.

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      Excuse me-

             SULLEY
        (growl)
      I just wanna get my stuff-
       SULLEY
(pushing efforts)
Ow...hey, come on..oof!

MIKE
Would you...just...let me get 
my stuff!  Ahhh, ow!

They fall out of their bedroom door.  Flash! They find all 
the misfits gathered there in the hallway, smiling at them.

             SQUISHY
      First morning in the house!

             ART
      Thats going in the album.

Don runs up the stairs out of breath.

             DON
      Guys!  We got...a letter!

             SQUISHY
      A letter?  Really?

             TERRI
      We never get mail.

      


Mike, Sulley, and the misfits gather around.  Don hands Mike the letter, Mike tries to take it from Don, but its stuck to 
his tentacles.

                                          64.

             DON
        (letter sticking to 
         tentacles vocs)
      Oh sorry, its stuck....

             MIKE
        (grabbing the letter)
      Would you, gimme that!

Mike finally pulls it off of Don and reads it.

             DON
      Tentacles...
        (laugh)
      Theyre sticky...

Mike opens the envelope revealing a mysterious letter.

             MIKE
        (gasp)
      Its the first event of the Scare 
      Games!

             MISFITS
        (walla)
      Cool!/Alright!

             MIKE
      A childs room is where you scare, 
      but avoid the toxicity lurking 
      there.

             SULLEY
      Wait a minute, where do they want 
      us to meet?

INT. SEWER/DRAIN SYSTEM, ON CAMPUS - NIGHT

Mike, Sulley, and the misfits tentatively step into the 
sewer/drain located on campus.  Water drips, graffiti on the 
wall, spooky.

             ART
      Of all the sewers on campus this 
      one has always been my favorite.

      


                                          65.
             TERRY
      Art, you've been here before?

             ART
      I have a life outside of the house, 
      you know!

As they step forward and turn a corner, they hear voices... 
and then they see:

The assembled throng for the first event of the Scare Games.

The Greek Council president and VP stand in the center of the 
sewer, on a stage against a wall.

All the competing fraternities and sororities are there, 
gathered around the stage.

             GREEK COUNCIL VP
      Welcome to your worst nightmare, 
      THE SCARE GAMES!
        (enjoying the excitement)
      Yeees, yes, I love it!  I love this 
      energy!  Okay, okay everybody!

Mike glances up, noticing Hardscrabble peering in from on 
high.

             GREEK COUNCIL PRESIDENT
      Lets hear it for the frats and 
      sororities competing in this years 
      games!  Jaws Theta Chi!

ON THE JOX TEAM.  A collection of big, wide-shouldered jocks.

Big Red, their leader, takes a board and breaks it over his 
head.

             GREEK COUNCIL PRESIDENT
	(CONTD)
      Python Nu Kappa!

ON THE PNK TEAM.  A group of pretty and seemingly friendly 
female monsters.  

             GREEK COUNCIL VP
      Slugma Slugma Kappa!

ON THE EEK TEAM.  A collection of athletic female monsters.  
They cheer in a huddle.

             GREEK COUNCIL VP
	(CONTD)
      Roar Omega Roar!

      


ON THE RORS.  These are the top scarers, wealthy, privileged, with the largest fan base.

             GREEK COUNCIL PRESIDENT
      Eta Hiss Hiss!

ON THE HSS.  A collection of creepy Goth coeds.  

                                          66.

             HSS SISTER
      Hiss...

             GREEK COUNCIL VP
      And finally... Oozma Kappa...

ON THE OOZMAS.  The guys look small and pathetic.  The crowd 
goes silent, a lone cheer accompanies the group.  Mike looks 
over to see Ms. Squibbles calling down from a sewer grate.

             MS. SQUIBBLES 
      YAY!  Woohoo!

             SQUISHY
      Hi Mom!

             MS. SQUIBBLES
      Smile!

She snaps a picture.

Back on the Oozmas, Mike sighs.

             GREEK COUNCIL VP
      Lets begin the first competition:  
      the toxicity challenge!

             GREEK COUNCIL PRESIDENT
      Human children are TOXIC!

She makes her way across the stage now to point to a drawing 
of childrens toys.

             GREEK COUNCIL PRESIDENT
	(CONTD)
      And anything they touch is toxic.

             GREEK COUNCIL VP
      We dont have any human toys but 
      thanks to MUs biology department, 
      weve found a close second.  The 
      stinging glow urchin!

Some students bring in a crate stamped with the words MU 
BIOLOGY DEPT.  The president reaches into the crate with a 
metal claw and pulls out a beautiful, glowing, spikey orb.

      


                                          67.
The crowd recoils in fear.

The urchin glows and sparks menacingly.

             GREEK COUNCIL VP
	(CONTD)
        (to the crowd)
      Trust me when I say you are not 
      gonna wanna touch this bad boy!

ON Art in the crowd.

             ART
      I wanna touch it.

ON president.

             GREEK COUNCIL PRESIDENT
      And you certainly dont wanna touch 
      any of its friends.

REVEAL an entrance to a tunnel... which is filled with 
hundreds of the toxic glow urchins scattered along the floor.  
The crowd is terrified.

ON Art.

ON VP.

             ART
      Yeah, I wanna touch em.

             GREEK COUNCIL VP
        (pointing to the tunnel)
      This is the starting line.  The 
      light at the end of the tunnel is 
      the finish line.

             GREEK COUNCIL PRESIDENT
      And whoever comes in last is 
      eliminated from the games.

             SQUISHY
      Mike?

Mike jumps.

             MIKE
      Ah!  What is it?

             SQUISHY
      Does that mean if we lose were 
      out?

      


                                          68.
             MIKE
      Dont worry, Smoothie.

             SQUISHY
      Squishy.

             MIKE
      Squishy.  Were not gonna lose, 
      because we have everything we need 
      to win right here.

Mike points to his chest.

             SQUISHY
        (smiling)
      Heart.

             MIKE
      No, me!  Im gonna win the race for 
      us.

Sulley pushes Mike out of the way.

             SULLEY
      Alright, alright, thats very cute 
      but move, move, move.  Im gonna 
      win this.

             MIKE
      Its an obstacle course - what are 
      you gonna do roar at it?!

             SULLEY
      I can get through faster than you, 
      little guy.

ON Mike as he glares at Sulley and readies himself at the 
starting line.

ON president.

             GREEK COUNCIL PRESIDENT
      Take your place at the starting 
      line!

We see the fraternities and sororities lined up along the 
starting line of the Scare Games course.

             ROSIE
      This is all about teamwork.

             CARLA
      Everybody stick together.

      


The misfits stand in the background, behind Mike and Sulley.
                                          69.

             MIKE
      Im gonna beat you over that finish 
      line!

             SULLEY
      Get ready to eat my dust!

             SQUISHY
      Hey guys, should we huddle up?

ON president and VP.

             GREEK COUNCIL PRESIDENT
      Attention teams, one last thing. 
      Scarers work in the dark.

With that, the floodlight is shut down, leaving the course 
entirely dark.  In the darkness, the glow urchins become 
infinitely more terrifying, glowing and sparking dangerously.

             SQUISHY
        (scared)
      I wanna go home.

             GREEK COUNCIL VP
      On your marks!

Squishy, Terri and Terry turn to the PNKs finishing their 
huddle.

             TERRY
        (nervous)
      Hey, good luck ladies.

             CARRIE
      Thanks, were gonna rip you to 
      pieces!

             TERRI
      What?

The PNK SISTERS shoot the misfits an evil look.

             PNK SISTERS
        (hiss sound)

The misfits are even more terrified now.

             GREEK COUNCIL VP
      Get set.

Mike and Sulley glare at each other one last time.

      


                                          70.
GO!!

THE RACE BEGINS!

             GREEK COUNCIL VP
	(CONTD)
ART runs off, the Oozmas and all the other teams follow 
behind Art who leads the charge with a war cry!

             ART
      Im gonna TOUCH EM!

He immediately hits a bunch of the glow urchins, which 
illuminate, shocking him.  He comes crashing down and looks 
over at his leg, which immediately balloons right up.

             ART
	(CONTD)
        (vocs getting hit & 
         falling, then laughing)
      AH!  WHOA!  Ah!
        (ballooning up)
      AAAAAAH!

The crowd goes crazy.

The teams are off!  Mike and Sulley carefully start 
navigating the danger, ignoring the misfits.

The EEK sisters are right behind the guys and one of them 
steps on an urchin.

             EEK SISTER #1
      Ow!

The girls rally together and help their sister keep going.

             CARLA
      Come on!

ON THE MISFITS who call out to Mike and Sulley.

             DON
        (calling out)
      Uh guys, were falling behind a 
      little.  FELLAS?
        (steps on urchin)
      Aaah!  CHEESE AND CRACKERS!  Ooh!  
      SON OF A MUSTACHE!  SALISBURY 
      STEAK, that hurts!

Squishy covers his ears.

BACK ON Sulley and Mike who are busy trying to outrun each 
other.

      


                                          71.
             MIKE
        (running)
      Is that as fast as you can go?

             SULLEY
        (running)
      Just getting started!

             MIKE
      What the-

Urchins whiz past them fired by monsters standing above them 
with slingshots.

Mike and Sulley try their best to avoid the flying urchins.

Sulley is hit by an urchin in the shoulder and instantly 
swells up.

             SULLEY
      Ah!

He grabs the urchin on his shoulder and his hand swells up.

             SULLEY
	(CONTD)
      AHH!

Mike runs ahead but turns back to laugh at Sulley.

             MIKE
      Ooh, thats gotta HURT!

Mike is hit by an urchin and falls.  He looks at his foot and 
it swells up!

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      AH!

The RORs with their awesome skills and their teamwork, 
quickly leave them in the dust.

Sulley runs whizzing past Mike.  Mikes determination is 
renewed.

He keeps his swollen leg lifted as he hops along in pain.

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
        (getting up grunt)
      Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ooh!

ON THE MISFITS.

Terri and Terry duck to avoid an urchin.

      


                                          72.
             TERRI
        (out of breath)
      Terry!

             TERRY
        (out of breath)
      Dont worry, well be fine--
        (hit in face by urchin)
      Aaaah!

Terrys face swells up and he screams!

Now not looking where theyre going, they step onto another 
urchin.

             TERRI/TERRY
      Ahhhh!

They trip and fall as their leg swells up.

Squishy sees them and screams.

He runs off in a panic and starts getting pummeled with 
urchins.

BAM!  An urchin flies into his mouth.  He swells into a giant 
pink ball.

The monster that threw it fist bumps another monster.

ON MIKE AND SULLEY

Mike and Sulley follow the RORs.  Still hopping on one leg, 
Mike smiles as he sees that Sulley is behind him.  Turning 
back, he ducks an urchin.

This throws him off balance and he loses control, landing on 
an urchin with his good foot.

             MIKE
        (landing on urchin)
      Yikes!
        (leg swells)
      Ow!

They have entered part of the course where urchins hang all 
around on strings at different heights.  He maneuvers to 
avoid them.

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
        (yelling; avoiding 
         urchins)
      Ow, ow, ow, ow!

      


ON SULLEY.
Sulley puts his head down and barrels through the urchins, 
getting zapped along the way.

Sulley continues to push through and catches up with Mike. 
They are neck and neck.

                                          73.

The RORs cross the finish line first.

             GREEK COUNCIL VP
      OH!  ROAR OMEGA ROAR wins!

             CROWD
        (cheering)

Mike and Sulley race to the end.

Finally, Mike and Sulley leap across the finish line at the 
exact same time.

             SULLEY
        (heavy breathing)
      Take that, Wazowski.

             MIKE
      Are you delirious?  I beat you.

             SULLEY
      Get your eye checked--

The crowd sees them and starts laughing.

             CHET
      Oh way to blow it, Oozmas!

             MIKE
      Hey, second place aint bad!

             GREEK COUNCIL VP
      Second place, Jaws Theta Chi!

             SULLEY
      What?

             JOHNNY
      Your whole team has to cross the 
      finish line!

             GREEK COUNCIL VP
      Third place EEKs...Fourth place PNKs...

             MIKE
      No...

      


                                          74.
             GREEK COUNCIL VP
      Fifth place HSS...

             MIKE
      No...no...NO!

             GREEK COUNCIL VP
      And in last place, Oozma Kappa!

Mike turns around in time to see the battered and bruised 
Oozma Kappa cross the finish line.  Don rolls Squishy out and 
then collapses.

             SQUISHY
      I cant feel my anything.

             GREEK COUNCIL PRESIDENT
      Oh shocker, Oozma Kappa has been 
      eliminated!

ON THE LEADER BOARD, Oozma Kappas name is removed.

             MIKE
      No...
        (gasp)

Mike backs up in a panic directly into Dean HARDSCRABBLE.

             HARDSCRABBLE
      Dont look so surprised, Mr. 
      Wazowski.  It would have taken a 
      miracle for you to s--

Mike turns to Hardscrabble, it dawns on him, hes done.

ON the VP.

             GREEK COUNCIL VP
      Attention everyone!  We have an 
      announcement!  Jaws Theta Chi has 
      been disqualified.

             CROWD
        (shocked WALLA)
      What?

Mike looks up to the stage, what?

             GREEK COUNCIL VP
      The use of illegal protective gel 
      is cause for elimination.

      


                                          75.
             CROWD
        (walla)
      Boo!

             BIG RED
      What?

A referee wipes goop off George Sandersons leg and pokes him 
with the urchin.

Zap!  Swell.

             GEORGE SANDERSON
      Ow!

             GREEK COUNCIL VP
      Which means, Oozma Kappa is back in 
      the games!  Its a miracle!

Hardscrabble cant believe it.  She glares at Mike.

             HARDSCRABBLE
      Your luck will run out eventually.

Mike looks worried.  He glances at his team.  The Oozma Kappa 
wave at him looking friendly and pathetic.

             MIKE 
      This is gonna be harder than I 
      thought.

The Oozma Kappa name is put back on the scoreboard.

EXT. QUAD

Mike has gathered the team together on the quad.  He passes 
before them like a drill sergeant as Sulley leans against the 
tree behind him.

             MIKE
      Okay, listen up Oozmas!  Now were 
      gonna have to start winning these 
      things together, so that means Im 
      gonna need each of you guys to pull 
      your own weight.

Squishy appears behind Mike.

             SQUISHY
      Mike.

      


                                          76.
             MIKE
      Ah!  What is it?

             SQUISHY
      Weve made a list of our strengths 
      and weaknesses.

             DON
      In high school I was the master of 
      the silent scare.  Why I could 
      sneak up on a field mouse in a 
      pillow factory.

Don delicately creeps along the ground on his hands and 
knees, but his tentacles stick to the sidewalk.  He awkwardly 
pulls them up each with a loud, grating, popping sound.

             DON
	(CONTD)
        (struggling)
      Sorry, they get stickier when Im 
      sweaty.
        (keeps walking)
      Oh my gosh, thats terrible.  Wait, 
      no, no...

Mike just stares at him....

Terry pulls out playing cards and begins to do a card trick.

             TERRY
      Were experts in the ancient craft 
      of close-up magic.

             TERRI
        (mysterious)
      Its all about misdirection.

Cards spill out of Terris sleeve and Terry sighs, 
embarrassed.

             ART
      I have an extra toe.
        (laughing, sotto)
      Not with me of course.

Mike calls out to quiet the team.

             MIKE
      Guys, one slipup in the next event 
      and were goners.  So for this to 
      work, Im gonna need you to take 
      every instinct you have and bury it 
      deep, deep down.

      


                                          77.
Mike crumples up their list and throws it away.

             ART
      Done.

             MIKE
      From now on we are of one mind, my 
      mind.

Sulley rolls his eyes.

             SULLEY
      Oh please.

             MIKE
      I will tell you exactly what to do 
      and how to do it.

             MISFITS
        (unsure)
      Okay Mike./That seems about 
      right./Sure.

             MIKE
      Alright, give me scary steps!  
      Fifty, up and down.  Right now, 
      lets go!

Sulley walks over to Mike.

             SULLEY
      Youre wasting your time...we need 
      a new team.

             MIKE
        (mocking)
      We can't just get a new team.  I 
      checked this morning, it's against 
      the rules.

             SULLEY
      What if we disguise the new team to 
      look like the old team?

             MIKE
      Oh, no, no, no, no.  We are not 
      cheating.

             SULLEY
      Its not cheating, Im just, you 
      know, leveling the playing 
      field....

Mike stares at him.

      


                                          78.
             SULLEY
	(CONTD)
      Okay, so its kind of cheating!  
      But what do you want me to do?  
      Theyre not exactly the scariest 
      group in the world.

Sulley points to the misfits now distracted from their 
training, crowded around Squishy.

             SQUISHY
      Oh, a ladybug!  Make a wish!  Make 
      a wish!

Art blows it off Squishys arm.  They all laugh, enjoying it 
fly away.

Hopelessness sets in.

             SULLEY
      This is not gonna work.

Sulley leaves.

             MIKE
      Where are you going?  Were 
      training!

             SULLEY
      I'm a Sullivan.

             MIKE
      That's not enough.  Youre all over 
      the place, youre charging ahead 
      when you need to--

             SULLEY
      Eh, b-b-b-bep.  You tell them what 
      to do, but not me.  So long, coach.

Sulley passes by a group of girls in the quad and shoots them 
finger pistols.

             GIRLS
        (giggling)

Mike watches concerned as Sulley heads off.

             MIKE
      Okay Oozmas-

He turns and jumps!  Squishy is standing right behind him.

      


             MIKE	(CONTD)
      AH!  Boy, we need to get you a 
      bell.

Mike turns to the group and pulls out the open envelope from 
the Scare Games and reads it.

                                          79.

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      Listen up!  If a kid hears you 
      coming, they'll call mom or dad.  
      Then you better run fast or things 
      will get bad.

             ART
      Huh?

             MIKE
      In the next event, if even one of 
      us gets caught, were all out.  So 
      remember, do EXACTLY what I do.

INT. LIBRARY

ON THE OOZMAs, as they sneak through the library, terrified 
of making a noise.  They copy Mikes every move.

ON VP and president surrounded by a group of onlookers in a 
nearby balcony overlooking the action.

             GREEK COUNCIL PRESIDENT
        (whispered to crowd)
      We are at the halfway point of the 
      second event, and things are 
      getting interesting.

The misfits walk in line with Mike, revealing an annoyed 
Sulley.  Sulley looks ahead to see the HSS sisters as they 
reach for their flag.

             HSS SISTER
      Got it!

They quickly get out of the library, having passed the test.

The other two flags left hanging are green and purple for the 
two remaining teams.

             GREEK COUNCIL PRESIDENT
        (whispered)
      Only two teams left. 

      


                                          80.
             GREEK COUNCIL PRESIDENT
	(CONT'D)
      Who will make it out with their 
      flag and who will be eliminated?

REVEAL THE EEKs as they sneak along too.

             GREEK COUNCIL VP
        (whispered)
      In a real scare you do not wanna 
      get caught by a kids parent, and 
      in this event you DO NOT want to 
      get caught by...The librarian.

ON AN OLD MONSTER LIBRARIAN

As she presses her tentacle fingers to her lips and quiets 
the room.

             LIBRARIAN
      Shhh.  Quiet.

She can hear a pin drop but she needs strong glasses to see 
anything.

ON the Oozmas and the EEKs creeping toward their flags.

             TERRI
        (whisper)
      Phhft, whats so scary about a  
      little old librarian?

A student is studying and gets up from his chair and the 
floor makes a small squeak.

Suddenly, the old librarian rises up, turning into a 
terrifying creature.

She grabs hold of the student and lifts him up.

             LIBRARIAN
      I said, quiet....

             LIBRARY STUDENT
      AHHHHH!!!

She throws the student through the dome of the library.

EXT. LIBRARY

The student flies through the air, dropping through a tree 
and into the river.

             LIBRARY STUDENT
      AHHHHHHHHH!!!

      


                                          81.
The crowd cheers.

INT. LIBRARY

ON Mike and the misfits shocked as the librarian soars over 
them to the other end of the library.

Mike breaths deeply, turns around and starts to put his foot 
down.

The board underneath squeaks so Mike quickly moves it to 
another board.

The misfits begin a slow, steady pace through the library, 
they literally walk exactly as Mike does.

Sulley cant handle their pace.

             SULLEY
        (whispered)
      FASTER!

Mike corrects him-

             MIKE
        (whispered)
      Slow and steady.

             ART
        (whispered)
      Slow and steady.

             DON
        (whispered)
      Slow and steady.

             TERRI/TERRY
        (whispered)
      Slow and steady.

             SQUISHY
        (whispered)
      Slow and steady.

The misfits relay the exact message down the line to Sulley 
the exact way Mike did.  They continue to move really slowly 
as Sulley is increasingly frustrated.

Sulley cant take it.  He bolts forward, leaving his 
teammates behind.

Mikes eye goes wide.

      


                                          82.

Mike shushes the misfits.

             MIKE
        (whispered)
      SHHH!

But they shush him back exactly as he did.

             ART
        (repeated)
      SHHH!

             DON
        (repeated)

Sulley runs to a book ladder and climbs on.  It makes a loud 
creak!  Everyone stops and looks back at the librarian.

The librarian turns around at Sulleys noise but luckily she 
cant see very well.

             LIBRARIAN
      Hmmmm...

She goes about her business.  Mike gives a sigh of relief.

But he gasps when he sees Sulley racing to the top of the 
ladder.

Sulley reaches for the Oozmas flag and almost gets it -

But the ladder starts to come off the tracks under the 
strain.

Sulley falls to the ground with a thunderous SLAM.

The librarian spins toward the sound, and quickly runs  
toward Sulley.

             LIBRARIAN
	(CONTD)
      Grrrr...

             MIKE
      No...

Her tentacles poised to grab him - he cringes, waiting to be 
yanked - but just then...

POP! POP! POP! POP! POP! POP! POP! POP!

The librarian whips around - whos making that noise?

Its DON!  And hes on his hands and knees crawling along the 
floor.  His tentacles are making a loud, sticky, suction cup 
sound.

             LIBRARIAN
      Grrrr...

The librarian leaves Sulley behind and makes a beeline for 
DON, her tentacles shooting toward him.

      


Now its Dons turn to cringe, bracing for impact.  Just before the librarian reaches Don...

Terri and Terry start-up their crazy dance moves.

                                          84.

             TERRI
        (yelling)
      5, 6, 7, 8!  Da-Da-da-da-da...look 
      over here!

             TERRY
      Over here!  Ahhhh!

             TERRI
      Da-da-da-da!  Over here now....

The librarian stops in her tracks and now she turns towards 
Terri and Terry.

Now its Terri and Terrys turn to be scared.  But just as 
the librarians tentacle reaches for them--

Art is now standing on top of a table stomping his feet and 
laughing hysterically.

ON VP and member of the crowd.

             CROWD MEMBER
      Is that legal?

             GREEK COUNCIL VP
      You better believe it, mop top!  
      The only rule is dont get caught.

As the librarian guns for Art, he somersaults off the table 
and rolls around in front of her, laughing like a mad man.

Mike looks on, horrified.

The EEKs are using a human rope to get to their flag.

Art continues rolling right past Sulley.  Terri and Terry 
shout at the librarian.

             TERRI/TERRY
        (shouting)
      Over here!  

As the librarian pursues Terri and Terry, one of her 
tentacles knocks the EEK pyramid over.

             TERRI/TERRY
	(CONTD)
        (shouting)
      Come and get me!  Come get me!

      


             MIKE      Guys, what are you doing?

She charges after the whole group.  The misfits run past Mike 
and pull him along.

                                          85.

             TERRY
      They said dont let her catch you!

             TERRI
      ...but they didnt say how!

             OOZMA KAPPA
        (walla, seeing the 
         librarian catch up to 
         them)
      AHH!/Move it, move it!/Come on!

The Oozmas narrowly miss her outstretched tentacles and burst 
through the library front doors to safety.

             OOZMA KAPPA
	(CONTD)
        (jumping out)
      Ahhhhh!!!!!

EXT. LIBRARY

The Oozmas land in a heap, excited they made it out.

             ART
      Woo!  We did it!

Mike spins around furious.

             MIKE
      No we didnt, we forgot the flag!

Mike is suddenly interrupted.

             SQUISHY
      Mike?

             MIKE
      Ah!

Squishy holds up the OK flag.

             MISFITS
        (cheer walla)
      Way to go, Squishy!

             MIKE
      How...?

      


                                          86.
Terri leans into Mike.

             TERRI
        (mysterious)
      ...misdirection.

The EEK sisters come flying out of the roof of the library.

             GREEK COUNCIL VP
      The EEKs have been eliminated and 
      Oozma Kappa live to scare another 
      day!

Meanwhile, a displeased Hardscrabble stands nearby observing.

Art, Terri, Terry, Squishy and Don celebrate.

             MISFITS
        (laughing, chanting)
      We're OK!  We're OK!  We're OK!  
      We're OK!  We're OK!

Mike watches the misfits.  He smiles, appreciating what 
theyve done.

EXT. OOZMA KAPPA FRATERNITY HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

The Oozmas walk home from the event, still on a high.

             SQUISHY
      Ive never felt so alive!

             TERRI
      We were awesome!

             SULLEY
      Okay, look, that wasnt real 
      scaring.

             MIKE
      It was better then what you did. 
      You should have stuck to my 
      strategy.

             SULLEY
      Whatever, talk to me when we start 
      the real scaring--

Mikes brow furrows.  Just as the misfits make it to their 
house, a car filled with members from the PNKs sorority  
pulls up.

      


                                          87.
             CARRIE
      Hey, you guys going to the party?

             SQUISHY
      Oh, I think youve got the wrong 
      guys, we dont get invited to--

             MIKE
        (trying to stop Squishy)
      Z-z-zip!  Party?

             CARRIE
      The mid-games mixer at the RORs.

             BRITNEY
      Its for the top scare teams... 
      youre one of us now, right?

             CARRIE
      See you there!

Laughing, the girls drive off.  The misfits look to each 
other, surprised.

             DON
      Did you hear that?

             SQUISHY
      I cant believe it.

             SULLEY
      Uh-uh.  Bad idea.

             MIKE
      This is great.  Theyre finally 
      seeing us as real scarers.  Were 
      going!

EXT. ROR HOUSE - EARLY EVENING

The Oozmas head up the stairs to the ROR house.  Sulley looks 
uncomfortable as they approach the closed door.  Hearing the 
loud music, the misfits start to get cold feet.

             DON
        (nervous)
      Do young people still dance?  Cause 
      my moves are a little rusty.

             TERRY
      Ah, we forgot to bring a hostess 
      gift!

      


                                          88.
             TERRI
      We cant go in there without some 
      scented candles.

             MIKE
      Calm down.  We earned this.

             SQUISHY
        (nervous)
      What if theres a lull in the 
      conversation?  I-I never know what 
      to...you know...

             MIKE
      ...Say?

             SQUISHY
      How are you so good at this?!

             MIKE
      You just took on an angry 50-foot 
      librarian and you're afraid of a 
      little party?  Take a deep breath.

The misfits inhale and exhale.

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      And in ya go!

The doors open wide.

INT. ROR HOUSE - EARLY EVENING

The room is full of big partying monsters.  They all turn to 
see the misfits standing in the door way.  The music stops.  
Squishy looks terrified, Mike nudges him.

             SQUISHY
      Hello.

The crowd stares at them blankly.

             PARTY MONSTER #1
      Its Oozma Kappa!

             PARTY MONSTER #2
      These guys are crazy!

             PARTY MONSTER #4
      What you did today was insane!

             PARTY MONSTER 
      That was awesome!

      


The music starts up and the monsters go back to partying.
                                          89.

             MISFITS
      Thank you!/Thanks so much!

             PARTY MONSTERS
      Oozmas, yeah!

Mike looks to Sulley, who is also shocked.  Mike turns to the 
misfits with a smile on his face.

             MIKE
      Oozma Kappa, tonight we party like 
      scarers!

             MISFITS
      YEAH!/WOO!

CUT TO the dance floor.  Each group is doing their thing!

Art is busting some crazy moves.

Don shows his stuff.  Terri and Terry are lovin the beat.

Squishy is dancing with the PNKs.

             SQUISHY
      I've never stayed up this late in 
      my life.

             PNK SISTERS
        (laughing)

Squishy is having a great time on the dance floor and spies 
Sulley standing by himself.  He decides to lasso him onto the 
dance floor.  Sulley is not amused.  Squishy is undeterred 
and begins reeling him in.  Sulley gives into his 
enthusiasm and reluctantly hops his way onto the dance floor 
with the rest of the misfits.

             SQUISHY
      WOO!

             PARTY MONSTERS
      Woo-woo!  Woo-woo!

Mike wanders to a hallway at the side of the party where 
portraits of the great Scare Game winners are located.  He 
sees the Scare Games trophy, set on a pedestal at the end of 
the room.  As he approaches, Mike sees his reflection in it.  
Distorted by its shape, he looks big and impressive.  Mike 
raises his claws and makes a small growl face.

ON JOHNNY as he addresses the party crowd.

      


                                          90.
             JOHNNY
        (whistle)
      Hey, quiet!  QUIET!  Quiet down you 
      can wranglers!  Alright, on behalf 
      of the RORs....

             CHET
      YEAH!

             JOHNNY
      Wed like to congratulate all the 
      teams that have made it this far!

Everyone cheers.  Johnny points to each of the teams.

             JOHNNY
	(CONTD)
      Alright, lets hear it for the 
      PNKS!  

             PNK SISTERS
        (Hiss)

             JOHNNY
      Love that trick, never gets old!  
      HISS!  

             HSS SISTERS
        (Hiss)

             JOHNNY
      Very creepy!  And finally the 
      surprise team of the scare games, 
      OOZMA KAPPA!  Come on over, guys.

The crowd parts, spotlighting Oozma Kappa.

             JOHNNY
	(CONTD)
      Now I gotta admit fellas, I thought 
      you were a bunch of nobodies, but 
      boy was I wrong.  Lets hear it for 
      Oozma Kappa!

             CROWD
      Oozma Kappa!

Suddenly without warning, the Oozmas are splattered with 
paint.

             MIKE
      Wha--?

             JOHNNY
      The most adorable monsters on 
      campus.

      


                                          91.
A bug monster then presses a button and a machine shoots 
glitter confetti at the Oozmas, sticking right to them.

Another ROR brother tosses a bucket of flowers at them.  They 
have become a laughing stock.

             JOHNNY
	(CONTD)
      Release the stuffed animals!

Randy pulls on a rope, connected to a net full of stuffed 
animals.  They drop and Chet quickly snaps a picture.

             CHET
        (laugh)
      Faced!

The screen goes white.

EXT. CAMPUS, NEXT DAY

Pulling back from one of the photos of the team covered in 
glitter and paint to reveal its printed on the cover of the 
schools newspaper: THE CAMPUS ROAR.  Mike puts the papers in 
the trash.

ON the misfits walking to class.  Mike is furious but does 
his best to boost the teams morale.

             MIKE 
      Dont worry.  Nobody reads the 
      school paper.

             ART
      Yeah, but Im pretty sure they read 
      the quad.

Mike looks over, stunned.  Trees, light posts, poster kiosks 
all covered with the photo in every shape and size.  The 
entire quad is blanketed with the embarrassing image as 
students look on and laugh.

A giant banner is unfurled on the clock tower.

Mikes shock is broken by an offscreen voice.

             CHET
      Thank you very much, okay would you 
      like that with two sleeves or four?

He turns to see Johnny and the RORs selling shirts and other 
merchandise featuring the photo.

      


             JOHNNY      Thanks!  Tell your friends!

Furious, Mike marches over followed by the team.

                                          92.

             MIKE
      Hey, what do you think youre 
      doing?

             JOHNNY
      Raising a little money for charity.

             MIKE
      Yeah, well stop it!

             JOHNNY
      You want us to stop raising money 
      for charity?  Thats not cool.

             CHET
        (calling out)
      This guy hates charity!

             MIKE 
      I want you to stop making us look 
      like fools.

             JOHNNY
      Hey, youre making yourselves look 
      like fools.

Johnny pulls out the paper.

             JOHNNY
	(CONTD)
      Lets be honest boys, youre never 
      gonna be REAL scarers, because real 
      scarers look like us.

He gestures to himself and his team.

             JOHNNY
	(CONTD)
      But hey, if you really want to work 
      for a scare company, theyre always 
      hiring in the mail room.

Johnny turns around the paper to reveal a help-wanted ad for 
the Monsters, Inc. mail room.

The misfits take this in as everyone laughs at them.

With that Sulley fumes and heads off.  The misfits follow, 
dejected.  Mike runs after them.

      


                                          93.
             MIKE
      Guys, hold on!  Hey, hey, hey, wait 
      a second!  Dont listen to him. We 
      just need to keep trying-

             SULLEY
      No, you need to stop trying!  You 
      can train monsters like this all 
      you want, but you cant change who 
      they are.

Sulley walks off.

             DON
      Mike, we appreciate everything 
      youve done...but hes right.  No 
      matter how much we train, well 
      never look like them.  Were built 
      for other things.

Don looks at his card.

The misfits follow after Sulley.

Mike watches them go, helpless.  Chet approaches holding a 
mug with the photo on it.

             CHET
        (slurp)
      Sorry Squirt, some monsters just 
      arent cut out for the big leagues.
        (laugh)

Mike stares out and suddenly something dawns on him.  He 
takes off--

             MIKE 
        (sotto)
      The big leagues.

INT. OOZMA KAPPA FRATERNITY HOUSE - EVENING

Mike bursts through the door and catches up with the misfits 
and Sulley.

             MIKE
      Guys!  Were going on a little 
      field trip.

      


EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
Ms. Squibbles drives a car filled with the Oozma Kappas.  She 
pulls over and stops, and the Oozma Kappas stretch as they 
climb out of the car.

                                          94.

             DON
      Okay, I need to get out....

             ART
      Excuse me, my legs caught.  There 
      we go, I got it.

             TERRI
      Ah...my tentacle fell asleep.

             SQUISHY
      Thanks, mom!

             MS. SQUIBBLES
      Have fun, kids!  Ill just be here, 
      listening to my tunes.

Ms. Squibbles rolls up the window, and we hear muted heavy 
metal thrasher music pounding from inside the car.

             ART
      Hey, uh, where are we?

Mike walks up to a gate with the guys behind him.  Mike looks 
over the gate in awe, as we reveal... Monsters, Incorporated.

             MIKE
      The big leagues.

Sulley is stunned.

             DON
      Holy, rolly polly...

             SQUISHY
      Wow!

             ART
      Nice fence.

             SQUISHY
      This is amazing, Mike!

             MIKE
      We're not stopping here.

      


                                          95.
Mike holds up a pair of wire cutters and does a chop-chop 
action.

EXT. MONSTERS, INC.

We see a fence cut out and a No Trespassing sign on the 
ground.

             SQUISHY
        (nervous voc)

We pan up and see the guys climbing a ladder that gets them 
onto the roof of Monsters, Inc.

             SQUISHY
	(CONTD)
      This is crazy, were gonna get 
      arrested!

             MIKE
      Shh!

INT. MONSTERS, INC.

They all look down through a window and all their eyes go 
wide.

                                  CUT TO:

             MISFITS
      Oh, whoa!  Wow.
        (excited laugh)

THEIR POV

We look down on a working scare floor.  The floor is full of 
scarers moving in and out of their active doors.  We see 
several monsters go through their entire routine.

             SQUISHY
      Look at them, theyre going into 
      the human world and they dont even 
      look scared!

Mike and Sulley take it all in.  Theyre awestruck.  The 
fraternity brothers look down in amazement.

             MIKE
        (to the group)
      Take a good look, fellas.  See what 
      they all have in common?

Squishy strains, but then turns to Mike confused.

      


                                          96.
             SQUISHY
      Ehhh...no, not really.

             MIKE
      Exactly.

A sea of monsters of all shapes, sizes, ages, genders, fill 
the floor, all scaring in their own way.

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      Theres no ONE type of scarer.  The 
      best scarers use their differences 
      to their advantage.

The team smiles watching all the various types of monsters 
using their varied appearances, sizes and shapes in unique, 
skillful ways.

A tall skinny guy with long skinny arms flails them around 
like wild hoses.  Squishy watches a puff ball turn into a 
spider.

             SQUISHY
      Wow.

             TERRY
      Terri, look!

ON a three-headed monster as it comes out of a room.

Sulley is starting to see Mike in a new light.  Huh.  Mike 
might actually be right about this.  The misfits are 
certainly inspired....

             DON
      Hey, look at that old fella rackin 
      up the big numbers!

             MIKE
        (amazed)
      Don, that old fella is Earl The 
      Terror Thompson!

             SULLEY
      What!  Where?!  Thats really him?

             MIKE
      He held the scare record for three 
      years!

             SULLEY
      Oh, third door from the end.

ON a female scarer.  

      


                                          97.
             MIKE
      Carla Killer Claws Benitez.

Sulley cant believe what hes seeing.

             SULLEY
      Look, its Screaming Bob Gunderson!

             SULLEY
	(CONTD)
      I still have his rookie card.

             MIKE
      Me too!

             SULLEY
      Doesnt have the speed any more but 
      his--
       MIKE
--technique is flawless.

SULLEY
--technique is flawless.

The guys have never had this kind of interaction before.  
Theyre not instant friends - its just a moment.

             MIKE
      You collected scare cards, huh?

             SULLEY
      Yep.  Four hundred and fifty of 
      em.

             MIKE
      Impressive.  I have 6,000, still in 
      mint condition.  But you know, four 
      fiftys pretty good too.

ON THE MISFITS, inspired by what theyre seeing on the floor.

             SQUISHY
      Hey, look at me, Im Earl The 
      Terror Thompson!  ROAR!

Squishy makes a scary face.

             MISFITS
      Hey, thats a pretty good one, 
      Squish!/Alright, Squishy!/Not 
      bad...you felt it.
        (laughter)

ON SULLEY AND MIKE watching the guys, then Sulley looks at 
the floor.

             SULLEY
      I've been a real jerk....

      


                                          98.
             MIKE
      So have I.
        (beat)
      But its not too late.  We could be 
      a great team, we just need to start 
      working together.

             SECURITY GUARD
      Hey!

             MIKE
        (gasp)

             SECURITY GUARD
      What are you doing up there?!

Everyone freezes.

             ART
      I cant go back to jail!

Art starts running, the others quickly follow.  

             DON
      Hey...

EXT. ROOFTOP

Mike, Sulley, and the misfits take off!

             MIKE
      Come on!

The gang hustles, pursued by guards.  They climb a ladder.

Sulley looks back.

             SULLEY
        (gasp)

ON THE GUARDS as they see them climbing.

Back ON the guys as they try to go down a ladder.

             MIKE
        (gasp)

             SECURITY GUARDS
      Up there!  Get em!

But the guards are at the bottom so they change direction.  
They start hopping over the rooftops.

      


Squishy is one of the last ones to jump and nearly falls but Sulley catches him.

                                          99.

             SQUISHY
        (panic breaths)
      Thanks brother.

Sulley puts Squishy on his shoulders.

             SULLEY
      Dont mention it!
        (running efforts)

They catch up with the rest of the team.

A beat later, Don is winded - he cant keep up.

             DON
        (heavy breathing)
      Im fine, really, its just a 
      little heart attack.

Sulley picks him up as well.

Art catches up to Sulley-

             ART
      Oh, I want a piece of that action!

They all jump onto Sulleys back.

Sulley rounds the corner, now carrying all the misfits.

EXT. MONSTERS, INC. GATES

They round the bend and sprint to the car just ahead of the 
guards.

             SQUISHY
      Mom, start the car!

They duck through the hole in the fence.

Ms. Squibbles lowers her window.

             MS. SQUIBBLES
      What?

             SQUISHY
      Start the car!

      


                                          100.
             MS. SQUIBBLES
        (confused)
      Stop the bar?

             SQUISHY
      The CAR!  Start the car!

             MS. SQUIBBLES
      Oh okay!

She starts the car as they pile in.

             MIKE
      Come on, come on, come on, come 
      on...

             ART
      In, in!

             SQUISHY
      Mom, go!

             MS. SQUIBBLES
      Seat belts.

The group quickly buckles as the guards move closer.

             SQUISHY
      Okay, go!

Mom reaches under the visor.

             MS. SQUIBBLES
      Does anyone want gum?

             SQUISHY
      JUST DRIVE!!

             MS. SQUIBBLES
      Okay, here we go.  Woo!

Mike reaches forward and slams on the gas.  The car peels 
away just as the guards catch up....

             OOZMA KAPPA
      Aaaahhhh!
        (laughing)

             ART
      Let's break in somewhere else!

      


                                          101.
INT. OOZMA KAPPA FRATERNITY HOUSE

             MIKE
      To frighten a child is the point 
      of a scare.  If you frighten a TEEN 
      then scarer beware!

Mike reaches down and grabs a stick that represents a human 
kid.

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      Okay, scare the little kid....

Mike throws in a stick that represents a human kid.

maze with nowhere to go.

Art comes dashing around a corner.  A teenager on a standee 
pops up.  

             TEENAGER #4
      But daddy I love him!

Art hides around the corner and the light on the standee 
turns green.  The standee moves out of his way and Art is 
able to continue down that path.

Art takes off through the maze.

      Time to go to work!

Mike and Sulley both get out of bed at the same time, 
maneuvering around their small room without getting in each

They both head off to class.

INT. ROR HOUSE

One of the RORs hides in a plant while Randy slinks up a lamp 
shade, disappearing completely.

A referee with several eyes sneaks around with a flashlight 
trying to find competitors.  The flashlight lands on a 
curtain.  Its pulled back to reveal a HSS sorority sister.

The referee blows the whistle.

             REFEREE
      Youre out!

The referee hears a rattle and catches a one-eyed monster 
holding up an end table.

             REFEREE
	(CONTD)
      Youre out!

The light finds the fireplace where debris falls down the 
chute.  Another HSS sister falls and lands in the soot.

             REFEREE
	(CONTD)
      Yeah, yeah, tough luck, Kris 
      Kringle.

She walks off frustrated.  The referee follows and completely 
misses Sulley who disguises himself as a bear rug.

      


                                          108.

      Enjoy the attention while it lasts, 
      boys.  After you lose, no one will 
      remember you.

             MIKE
      Maybe, but when you lose no one 
      will let you forget it.

             CHET
        (sotto)
      Oh boy, that is a good point.

Johnny slaps Chet and they all walk off.  Mike and the Oozmas 
smile and watch them leave.

A group of fans approach.

             OOZMA FAN #1
      Hey Oozmas, you guys are awesome!

             OOZMA FAN #2
      Youve gotta teach us your moves.

Don points to Mike.

             DON
      Well then, you're gonna wanna talk 
      to this guy.

ON Mike pleasantly surprised by the attention.

             MIKE
        (laughing)
      Oh, sure I can teach you.

Sulley smiles as he watches Mike enjoy his much-earned 
attention.

             MIKE

      ...Alright, you wanna hide behind 
      the chair, you have to become the 
      chair...see, the trick to hiding is 
      understanding your surroundings.

Sulley spots Dean Hardscrabble as she walks by the VP.

             GREEK COUNCIL VP
      Thanks for coming, Dean.

Sulley follows the dean and then humbly addresses her.

             SULLEY
      Dean Hardscrabble?  If we get back 
      into the scaring program, I hope 
      theres no hard feelings?

She stops and turns to Sulley.

             HARDSCRABBLE
      Tomorrow each of you must prove 
      that you are undeniably scary.  And 
      I know for a fact, that one of you 
      is not.

Hardscrabble looks over at the team, she lands on Mike.  
Sulleys eyes follow.

             MIKE
        (effort sounds)
      Its as simple as that.

             SULLEY
      No, he works harder than anyone.

             HARDSCRABBLE
      Do you think hes scary?

             SULLEY
      Hes the heart and soul of the 
      team.

             HARDSCRABBLE
      DO YOU think hes scary?

No response.

Hardscrabble turns and walks away.

Sulley stares after Hardscrabble as she walks off - she cant 
be right, can she?

INT. MIKE AND SULLEYS ROOM, NIGHT

ON Mike scaring.  Sulley lies on his top bunk, staring at 
nothing.

             MIKE

             SULLEY
	(CONTD)
      You know, youve given me a lot of 
      really great tips.  Id love to 
      return the favor sometime.

             MIKE
      Oh yeah, sure.  Anytime.

ON Sulley clearing furniture to make room.

Mike stands in the middle of the room, watching Sulley.

             MIKE

Sulley grabs Mikes textbook.

             SULLEY
      Okay, youve memorized every 
      textbook, every scare theory and 
      that is great.

He tosses the book out the window.

             MIKE
      Hey!

We hear a cat squeal outside. 

             SULLEY
      But now, its time to forget all 
      that.  Just reach deep down and 
      Let the Scary Out."

             MIKE
      Huh, just feel it.

             SULLEY

Mike and Sulley stop and look toward the disembodied voice of 
Ms. Squibbles.

             MIKE
        (out of breath)
      So, how was that?

Sulley smiles and puts up his hand for a high five.

             SULLEY
      Up top.

Mike high-fives him.  Both guys make their way back to bed.

	(CONTD)
      Yep, this time tomorrow, the whole 
      school is finally gonna see what 
      Mike Wazowski can do.

      down....

Johnny yells from off to the side.

      Hey Bruiser, you take it easy on 
      Grandpa!

Art calls from the other side.

             ART
      Unleash the beast, Don!

Don looks nervous, but does his best to cover.

             DON
      Okay, then.

A light flashes red, yellow, green.  GO!

Theyre off!  Don gets to his door, pulls out a dossier and 
reads the info on his child.  A Jumbotron shows Don entering

But he recovers.  As the sim kid sits up, Reggie turns and 
scares him immediately.

             REGGIE
      ROAR!

             SIM KID
      AHHHHHH!


The scoreboard shows Reggies score.  Johnny is not happy.

The sim kid sits up and we see Don on the ceiling.  He swoops 
down toward the bed, hanging by an arm.

             DON
      ROAR!

             SIM KID
      AAHHHHHH!

Reggie sees Dons scare register on the board, and eclipse 
his by a small percent.  The Oozmas are thrilled!

ON Don stepping out of the simulator with new found 
confidence.  He looks to Reggie and the RORs.

             DON
        (confident)
      Thanks for taking it easy on 
      grampa.

Reggie and the RORs are a little shocked.

ON SIMULATOR as two referees finish rearranging the toys in 
the room, they give the thumbs up when its ready.

A door opens and in walks the silhouette of a human.  But 
then the human splits apart into a four-armed, two-headed 
creature and lunges into the foreground revealing Terri and 
Terry, roaring.  The kid screams.

A sim kid lies quietly in bed when the closet door opens.  Is 
that Squishy in front of the door?  The kids eyes scan the 
room and go back to the door, Squishys gone.

A second later, the kid turns and Squishy is suddenly right 
beside him.

The sim kid screams and Squishys scream can fills up just 
over half way.

Score board shows Oozmas have taken a small lead!

Squishys mom cheers wildly.

Art comes in, taking large steps across the room then 
balancing on his hands.  Its a mixture of break-dancing and 
yoga.  He flattens and rolls under the bed.

A four-armed bug monster from the ROR team let's loose his 
scare.

ON scoreboard as the bug guy creates an even bigger lead.

             JOHNNY AND ROR BROTHERS

Art appears at the kids side and strikes a strange yoga 
pose.

             ART
        (warbled)
      Roar!

Arts scream can only fills up halfway.  Not enough points to 
pull up to the RORs.

ON MIKE, disappointed.  Its not looking good for the Oozmas, 
the RORs have too big a lead.  But they rally anyway.

             GREEK COUNCIL VP
      Next up, Sullivan and Boggs!

Randy and Sulley take their places at the starting line.

The light turns and theyre off!

Sulley stops at the door, opens his dossier.

ON the dossier.  7-year-old, lives on Kauai and is afraid of 
thunder and lions.

Mike watches as Sulley studies the information.

The room shakes and the sim kid screams.

ON RANDY, as his simulator shakes from Sulleys roar.

Randy drops to the ground and is thrown off his game.  He 
blends into a heart rug this time and lets out a meager roar.

      Oh, tough break for the RORs!

Randy sees them celebrating as he backs up and runs right 
into Johnny.

             RANDY
      Huh?

Johnny is fuming.

             JOHNNY

Johnny stares daggers at Randy.

      Sullivan.

             GREEK COUNCIL VP
      Worthington and Wazowski to the 
      starting line!

All eyes on Mike.

Mike pauses, a bit of doubt setting in.  He looks over and 
sees Hardscrabble looking in his direction.

Sulley approaches Mike.

             SULLEY
      Hey.  Don't worry about 
      Hardscrabble, don't worry about 
      anyone else.  Just go out there and 
      show em what Mike Wazowski can do.

Mikes nervousness fades when he hears this.

Mike heads to the starting line.  Hes right next to Johnny.

             JOHNNY
      Dont take the loss too hard.  You 
      never belonged here anyway.

Mikes eye narrows.  For the first time he looks determined.

The light turns and theyre off!

Mike and Johnny are neck and neck.

They enter their simulators.

INTERCUT as they both approach the sim kid.  Johnny creeps 
toward the bed.  Mike takes his time, dodging toys and 
distracting the kid with a scratch to the bed.

Johnny goes in for the kill.

Mike crouches by the bed, contemplating his next move.  Every 
discouraging statement floating through his mind....

Mikes eye opens and he leaps up over the bed and ROARS!

             MIKE
      ROAR!

Oozma Kappas point tally beats the ROR house!  Everyone goes

The crowd rushes the stadium, flying by the stunned ROR

Mike steps from the simulator, stunned as he realizes what 
has happened.

The Oozma Kappas run to Mike, hoisting him on to their 
shoulders.

      YEAH!!  Were in the scare program!

hugs her.

             SULLEY
        (calling out)
      Hey Wazowski!  Come on, lets go, 
      you maniac!  Were celebrating!

Sulley finds Mike standing alone in the Oozmas simulator.

             SULLEY
	(CONTD)
      Mike?

Mike is beaming, lost in his own little world.

             MIKE
      I did it.  I cant believe it.

Sulley smiles....

Mike turns around.

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      Im gonna be a scarer!

             SULLEY
        (laughing)
      Yeah, yes, you are!

Mike turns to the sim kid one more time.

             MIKE
      Hey, you hear that?  Get plenty of 
      rest kidd-o....You havent seen the 
      last of Mike Wazowski.  BOO!

Mike playfully throws his hands in the air toward the sim kid 
--to his shock the sim kid shoots out of bed and lets out a 
terrifying scream, reacting just as wildly as it did in the 
competition.

Mike leaps back in shock.

Mike turns to see the can fill all the way to the top.

      


                                          126.
Sulley says nothing, he looks confused, slightly worried.

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      I knew I was scary, I didnt know I 
      was that scary....

Mike chuckles awkwardly, clearly confused.

             SULLEY
        (covering)
      Yeah, were so scary, I guess we 
      broke it.  Cmon.  

But Mike approaches the bed slowly, his smile fading.  Mike 
leans in and snaps his fingers right by the sim kids head.  
The dummy shoots back into the air and screams.

Confused, Mike lifts the bed skirt to reveal a control panel.  
We see a row of six gauges with a row down labeled Easy, 
Medium, and Hard.

             MIKE
      Its been tampered with.

             SULLEY
      Uh, I dont think you should be 
      messing with that.

             MIKE
      Why are my settings...different?

Suddenly it dawns on Mike.

             SULLEY
      Mike, we should leave.

Mike looks at Sulley.  Sulley looks cornered.  Suddenly it 
dawns on Mike.

             MIKE
      Did you do this?

             SULLEY
      Mike.

             MIKE
      DID YOU do this?

Sulley struggles then...

             SULLEY
        (ashamed)
      I...yes, I did, but you dont 
      understand--

      


                                          127.
             MIKE
      Why?!  Why did you do this?

Mikes face drops, his heart breaks.

             SULLEY
        (sigh)
      You know, just in case...

             MIKE
      In case of what?

Sulley lifts his head and looks at Mike.  Suddenly it all 
dawns on Mike.

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      You dont think Im scary.

             SULLEY
      Mike...

             MIKE
        (hurt)
      You said you believed in me....
        (then, angry)
      But youre just like Hardscrabble.  
      Youre just like everyone else.

             SULLEY
      Look, youll get better and better-

             MIKE
      Im as scary as you!  Im as scary 
      as anyone!

             SULLEY
      I just wanted to help.

             MIKE
      No, you just wanted to help 
      yourself!

             SULLEY
      Well, what was I supposed to do?  
      Let the whole team fail because you 
      dont have it?!

And just like that, Sulleys said it.  And Mike is thrown for 
a second.  Then his eye narrows, and he storms off.

As he does, REVEAL the misfits, who are standing just off the 
stage.  They saw the whole thing, and they look hurt/confused 
/disappointed/angry.

      


                                          128.
While the others walk away, Squishy sets down the trophy and 
shuffles off with them....

ON SULLEY as he tries to process how totally wrong 
everythings gone.  In what was supposed to be a triumphant 
moment, hes alone - confused, angry, frustrated....

INT. MU DOOR TECH LAB

Two door lab students walk by and reveal Mike leaning up 
against a wall across from the door tech lab.

             DOOR LAB STUDENT #1
      So your calculations were a little 
      off.

             DOOR LAB STUDENT #2
      That door took me ALL semester.

             DOOR LAB STUDENT #3
      Its too dangerous, the professors 
      just gonna shred it.

EXT. MU CAMPUS - MOMENTS LATER

Sulley walks across campus, still confused, upset.  Holding 
the trophy limply.

As he passes students...

             STUDENTS
      There he is!  The big guy!/The 
      first of many trophies....

If this is everything Sulley wanted... hes too out of it to 
notice.  He just moves past the students, numb, and glances 
at his sad reflection in the trophy.

             PROFESSOR KNIGHT
      Sullivan!

Sulley looks up from the trophy to see Professor Knight.

             PROFESSOR KNIGHT
	(CONTD)
      Nice work out there.  I look 
      forward to having you back in 
      class.

Sulley looks conflicted as Knight heads to the School of 
Scaring.

      


                                          129.
             CHET
      Hey, there he is!

REVEAL JOHNNY and the RORs, who walk up.

             JOHNNY
      Looks like I was wrong about you.  
      Youre one of us after all....

He holds out a ROR jacket for Sulley.

             CHET
      Way to go, Sulley.  Welcome back 
      Broham!  You are one of us now, 
      okay?  So anytime you wanna come 
      hang out and do whatever, you got a 
      crew....

        (walla)
      Yeah!/Youre a ROR/Sullivan!

             CHET
      Youre a ROR, buddy!

Sulley looks at Johnny, then past him... he sees Knight 
talking to Dean Hardscrabble, at the entrance to the School 
of Scaring.

A look of resolve comes over Sulleys face - he knows what he 
has to do.

He hands the jacket AND the trophy to Johnny and runs off....

             JOHNNY
        (flustered)
      Hey!  Where are you going-?

INT. MU DOOR TECH LAB

Mike stares at the door lab.  Several students shut off the 
light and come out of the lab.

Mike casually walks by them, grabbing one of their card keys.  
Glancing around, he swipes the card.  He waits for the green 
light and opens the door, heading in.

EXT. SCHOOL OF SCARING/QUAD

Sulley is in mid-confession to Hardscrabble and Knight.

      You did what?

             SULLEY 
      My team had nothing to do with it, 
      it was all me...I cheated.

Hardscrabble and Knight are stunned.

             HARDSCRABBLE 
      I expect you off campus by 
      tomorrow.

Sulley hangs his head accepting his fate.

             SULLEY
        (sotto)
      Yes maam.

             HARDSCRABBLE
      Youre a disgrace to this 
      University...and your family name.

Sulley is crushed.

Suddenly, an alarm sounds on campus.

A security guard is running by....

             HARDSCRABBLE
	(CONTD)
      Whats going on?

             SECURITY GUARD
      Someone broke into the door lab!

             HARDSCRABBLE
        (sotto)
      What?!

Hardscrabble flies off immediately....

Sulley watches her fly towards the door tech building.  

It dawns on Sulley...Mike.

             SULLEY
      Oh no...

INT. MU DOOR TECH LAB

Mike places a scream can in its station. He takes off his hat 
and places it on a scream can as he faces off with the door.

      


                                          131.
He powers up the door.

In the background, we hear security guards trying to get in.  
Mike has blocked the door with a cart full of scream cans.

             SECURITY GUARDS
        (walla)
      Open the door!/Dont go in 
      there!/Its very dangerous!

He stands there, unflinching in front of the door.  The light 
turns on above the door and Mike turns the knob.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

In the human world, a closet door opens.  Mike steps through 
it and quietly shuts the door.  Hes in the human world!

             MIKE
        (big exhale)

He makes his silent, stealthy approach towards the bed, 
building a scary mood.

The kid slowly sits up, sensing something....

Suddenly Mike leaps up and ROARS.

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      ROAR!!

             KID #1
        (gasp)

The kid stares at Mike.  Mike roars again.

             MIKE
      ROAR!

Then the kid smiles.

             KID #1
      You look funny.

ON MIKE, as he reacts, confused/disappointed/upset.

             MIKE
        (confused)
      What?

Mike hears a COUGH offscreen.

      


                                          132.
The camera pulls out to reveal hes in a cabin full of beds, 
a kid bunked down in each one.  A banner hangs on the wall, 
reading, Camp Teamwork.

The other kids start to wake up.  Groggily, they stare at 
Mike.

             KIDS
        (waking up walla)
      Whats going on?/Its the middle of 
      the night./Hes a little funny 
      green guy....

Mike is thrown - what should he do?

He takes a step back toward the closet door when he turns and 
next to the closet is another kid.  He freezes.

A beat.

             MIKE
      ROAR!

             KID #2
        (playful, back at Mike)
      ROAR!

Mike gasps in disbelief.

The other kids in the cabin start to get closer.  Hes 
trapped!

             CAMP KIDS
        (walla)
      What is that?/Hey, I was 
      sleeping./I wanna touch it./Hes so 
      cute!

INT. MU DOOR TECH LAB

Sulley runs through the hall and up to the door lab, where a 
crowd of students is being held back by campus security.

             DON
      James!

             HARDSCRABBLE
      No one goes near that door until 
      the authorities arrive.

      


Sulley moves to the front of the crowd near the misfits.  Inside the lab, Hardscrabble oversees additional security 
personnel who are securing the door and investigating the 
scene.

                                          133.

             DON
      You dont think that could be-

             SULLEY
      Its Mike.

             SQUISHY
      But he could die out there!

Sulley tears down the Caution Do Not Cross tape.

             SQUISHY
	(CONTD)
      James, wait!  We can help.

Don steps forward.

             DON
      Leave it to the old, Master of 
      Sales.

ON Hardscrabble and the guards.  They are talking in the door 
tech lab when Don confidently strolls up to them.

             SECURITY GUARD
      Weve got a call in, but thats the 
      best we can do---

Don taps one of them on the shoulder and they turn around 
bewildered to see someone has crossed into the lab.

             DON
      Ahem.
        (turning on the charm)
      Don Carton, sales.  Folks, today is 
      your lucky day, how many times have 
      you asked yourself the following 
      question--

Hardscrabble stares at Don, not buying it.

             HARDSCRABBLE
        (dismissive)
      Arrest him.

Suddenly, two guards throttle Don against the wall.

      


                                          134.
             DON
      Pardon?
        (impact)
      Ahhh!

             SECURITY GUARD
      Spread em, Pops!

             DON
      Do you mind?!

             SECURITY GUARD
      Dont move!

Sulley runs for the door.

When Sulleys almost to the door, Hardscrabble spots him out 
of the corner of her eye.

             HARDSCRABBLE
      What?  Sullivan!  Don't you dare!

He grabs the door handle....

             HARDSCRABBLE
	(CONTD)
      Sullivan, dont go in there!  

Sulley quickly looks back toward Hardscrabble, ignores her 
and slips through the door.

INT. CAMP TEAMWORK - NIGHT

Sulley creeps through the cabin, which is empty.  Where is 
Mike?

             SULLEY
        (whisper)
      Mike?  Mike?

Sulley hears voices outside and crosses to a window.  Some 
camp counselors are gathered in front of one of the kids 
cabins, relating the events of the night to some park 
rangers.  The flashing lights of the rangers cruiser strobe 
through the cabin.

             COUNSELOR
      The kids are saying they saw 
      something in the cabin.

             COUNSELOR #2
      Theyre calling it an alien.

      


                                          135.
             KID #1
      It was!

             KID #2
      I saw a little green guy!

Sulley hears a noise and looks over to see a broken screen.  
He goes to the screen and whispers outside....

             SULLEY
        (whispered)
      Mike?

He climbs out the window.

EXT. CABIN - NIGHT

Sulley jumps down from the window.

A couple of rangers hear him and train their flashlights on 
him.

             SULLEY
        (gasp)
      Ah!

             RANGER
      Bear!  A bear in the camp!

Sulley takes off running, jumping down into a gully, evading 
the lights.

Sulley sprints through the woods.  He bursts through some 
brush and comes to the edge of a lake.

He scans the lake but hears men yelling and ducks behind a 
rack of canoes, seeing flashlights in the distance.

             RANGERS
        (walla)
      Down there, everybody over here...I 
      heard something over here.

Sulley hears a splash and turns to see Mike sitting at the 
foot of the lake, staring at his reflection in the water.

             SULLEY
        (gasp then sigh of relief)
      Mike!

Mike doesnt look back.

      


                                          136.
             SULLEY
	(CONTD)
      Cmon buddy, lets get you out of 
      here.

Mike still doesnt look up.

             SULLEY
	(CONTD)
      This is all my fault...Im sorry---

Mike continues to look down.

             MIKE
        (depressed)
      You were right, they werent scared 
      of me.

Sulley moves closer and looks down at Mike, silent.

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      I did everything right.  I wanted 
      it more than anyone.  And I 
      thought, I thought if I wanted it 
      enough, I could show everybody 
      that...

Mike stares at his reflection in the water.

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      That Mike Wazowski is something 
      special, and Im just...not.  

He splashes it away.

             SULLEY
      Look Mike, I know how you feel---

             MIKE
      Dont do that.  Please dont do 
      that.  You DO NOT know how I feel.

Mikes raises his voice, Sulley looks around cautiously.

             SULLEY
      Mike, calm down.

             MIKE
      Monsters like you have everything. 
      You dont have to be good, you can 
      mess up over and over again, and 
      the whole world loves you.

             SULLEY
      Mike-

      


                                          137.
             MIKE
      Youll never know what its like to 
      fail, because you were born a 
      Sullivan!

             SULLEY
      Yeah, Im a Sullivan!  Im the 
      Sullivan who flunked every test, 
      the one who got kicked out of the 
      program.  The one who was so afraid 
      to let everyone down, that I 
      cheated, and I lied.  
        (sigh)
      Mike, Ill never know how you feel, 
      but youre not the only failure 
      here.

Sulleys shoulders drop, he sits down next to Mike.

             SULLEY
	(CONTD)
      I act scary Mike, but most of the 
      time...Im terrified.

             MIKE
      How come you never told me that 
      before?

             SULLEY
      Because...we werent friends 
      before.

Mike is stunned, at a loss for words.

Suddenly a flashlight grazes Sulley.

Sulley jumps back as the lights come toward him.

Mike hides behind a rock as he watches Sulley driven away.

Mike is in shock.  Sulley looks back at Mike, they both dont 
know what to do.  After a second, Sulley just takes off 
running.

             RANGERS
        (walla)
      Over there...

Sulley runs through the darkness and right into an 
EMBANKMENT.

He tries to climb the slippery side of the embankment but the 
flashlights are getting closer.

      


                                          138.
Just as he is struggling, a tree limb is suddenly lowered 
down next to him.

             MIKE
      Sulley.

Sulley looks up - its Mike, at the top of the embankment.  
Sulleys surprised....

In the distance, the sound of humans is getting closer, and 
we can make out flashlights in the trees.

Mike lowers the tree branch a little more, bracing his feet 
against some rocks.

He pulls Sulley up over the edge.  They take off back toward 
the cabin.

EXT. CABIN - NIGHT

The rangers are surrounding the cabin.

Mike and Sulley see an opening and sprint toward the cabin.  

INT. CABIN - NIGHT

The guys burst into the cabin, run to the closet door and 
throw it open!

REVEAL: Just a closet full of camping supplies.  No monster 
world.

ON MIKE AND SULLEY, who react, dismayed.

             MIKE
      No...

INT. SCHOOL OF DOOR TECHNOLOGY

The door powers down.

The door lab is crawling with campus security.  Dean 
Hardscrabble stands beside the door station, a finger on the 
power button.  

Oozma Kappa is being held back by security.

             DON
      Theyre still in there!

      


                                          139.
             HARDSCRABBLE
      Until the authorities arrive, this 
      door stays off.

The misfits react.  Hardscrabble has just delivered a death 
sentence.

             SQUISHY
      NO!  You cant do that!

Squishy breaks the line, tearfully charging for his friends, 
but hes held back with ease by security.

             HARDSCRABBLE
      Enough!  I want this room cleared, 
      now!

Security starts herding students out of the lab.

             MISFITS
        (walla)
      Hey, you cant do this!/Please 
      wait, dont do this now!/He needs 
      our help!

The lab doors are slammed shut.

                                  CUT TO:

INT. CABIN - NIGHT

Mike and Sulley are panicked.  Mike closes the door, then 
quickly opens it, but again, nothing.

Mike and Sulley hear the humans outside getting closer.

They run to the cabin window and see that a group of rangers 
has arrived.  They approach the cabin, shining flashlights.

Sulley runs away.

             SULLEY
      Weve gotta get out of here.

Mike gets an idea.

             MIKE
        (whispered)
      Let them come!

      


                                          140.
             SULLEY
        (whispered)
      What?

Sulley looks at Mike, confused.

             MIKE
      If we scare them, I mean really 
      scare them...we could generate 
      enough scream to power the door 
      from this side.

             SULLEY
      What are you talking about?!

             MIKE
      I have read every book about 
      scaring ever written.  This could 
      work!

             SULLEY 
      Theyre ADULTS!  I cant do this!

             MIKE
      Yes you can, just follow my lead.

                                  CUT TO:

ON THE DOOR to the cabin.  The doorknob turns, then rangers 
pour in, flashlights pointing into the darkness.

They jump as a fan turns on suddenly, then slows to a stop.

The window drapes flutter, as if someone has just touched 
them.

The rangers proceed farther into the cabin.

Up in the rafters, Sulley and Mike nod at each other.  Mike 
counts down silently as they get ready for their next action.

BAM!  The front door of the cabin slams shut behind the 
rangers.

The rangers hear music.  They spin around and see a record 
player, playing a record backward.

They hear another sound and turn their flashlights on a doll 
walking across the cabin.

             DOLL
      Ma-ma.  Ma-ma.

The doll walks into a bed post and falls down.

      


                                          141.
             DOLL
	(CONTD)
        (warbled)
      Ma-ma.  Ma-ma...

They see a dark shadow run across the floor behind them.  
Its Mike.

Sulley reaches down behind the rangers and scrapes the floor 
with his claws.  The rangers turn in time to see the claw 
marks on the floor.

They hear something in the rafters.  Shining their 
flashlights in that direction they see more claw marks on the 
walls all around them.

They hear a deep, low growl as something short and round 
scurries across the floor.

             SULLEY
        (growl)

             RANGER
      What the-

             RANGERS
        (gasp)
      Whoa!

Just before their flashlights reach Mike, Sulley reaches down 
and pulls him up into the rafters again like a basketball.

             RANGERS
	(CONTD)
        (walla)
      I heard it./Its going this way.

             SULLEY
        (whispered)
      Now what?

             MIKE
        (whispered)
      Phase two.

Down on the floor, the rangers jump when suddenly the bunk 
beds start to topple over toward them like dominoes.

The terrified rangers run to avoid being hit by the beds, 
which fall on the front door, blocking it.

                                  CUT TO:

INT. MU DOOR TECH LAB

Hardscrabble is alone in the lab.

Faint screams are heard and the light above the door suddenly 
flickers red then fades back to black.

Hardscrabble stares at the light, baffled.

INT. CABIN, CONTINUOUS

Mike smiles as he sees the door to the monster world start to 
glow.

He turns to Sulley.

             MIKE
      Are you ready?

             SULLEY
      Mike, I can't.

             MIKE
      Yes, you can.  Stop being a 
      Sullivan, and start being you.

Sulley looks uncertain.

             RANGER #1
      Call for backup!

             RANGER #2
      Assistance on the north side.  
      Repeat, we need assistance on the 
      north side. 

Mike jumps down from the rafters behind the rangers.  He 
grabs a fishing pole and ties some of the line to a table 
leg.  He runs around the room, encircling the rangers.

             RANGERS
        (walla)
      What was it?/Lets go!

The rangers are spooked.

From a hiding place behind a piece of furniture, Mike locks 
eyes with Sulley and nods.  It sinks in, Sulley becomes 
determined.  Its time.

      


                                          143.

	(CONTD)
        (walla, glimpsing Mike 
         rolling by)
      Over here!/Its right behind you!

Sulley drops from the rafters, landing in front of the 
rangers.  He begins to let out a deep growl....

As the rangers recoil in horror, Mike tightens the fishing 
line around the rangers legs causing them to fall and get 
tangled in the line.  

As the rangers struggle on the floor, Sulley looms over them 
and lets out a ferocious roar.

             SULLEY
      ROAR!!

The ranger screams are overwhelming....

                                  CUT TO:

INT. MU DOOR TECH LAB

In the lab, the screams burst through, flooding the room with 
energy.  

Everyone outside the lab sees bright lights.  Something is 
going on, but no one can tell what it is.

The light above the door turns bright red, followed by the 
stacks of scream cans across the room filling up completely.  

Hardscrabble, alone in the lab, is stunned.

INT. CABIN 

The closet door glows brightly.

             SULLEY
      ROAR!!!

ON THE RANGERS, screaming as they run from Mike and Sulley.

INT. MU DOOR TECH LAB 

Close up of scream cans on a shelf overflowing, exploding... 
some flying through the air.

Hardscrabble, standing in front of the cans, doesnt know 
what to do -- she looks to the door.

INT. CABIN - HUMAN WORLD

Mike sees that the door is now on.

             MIKE
      Sulley, come on!

They run for their exit.

INT. MU DOOR TECH LAB 

Hardscrabble sees the door is about to explode and she jumps 
out of the way.

Sulley and Mike burst through it in a cloud of smoke and 
debris.

Hardscrabble peeks out from behind several destroyed scream 
cans.  For the first time, Dean Hardscrabble is dumbfounded.

They all look back at the door, which has been completely 
destroyed.

Mike sees his smoking, tattered MU hat in the rubble.

Hardscrabble approaches Mike and Sulley.

             HARDSCRABBLE
      How...how did you do this?

             SULLEY
      Dont ask me.

Sulley looks at Mike.  Mike looks unaware.  She cant believe 
it.

Suddenly someone is sawing through the wall and the Child 
Detection Agency blast through to the lab.

             CDA AGENT #1
        (walla)
      Move!  Move!  Move!  This is a 5423

      clear out!  Secure the perimeter.

             CDA AGENT #3
      No child breach, repeat: No child 
      breach.

The CDA cover the room, inspecting and grabbing Mike and 
Sulley.

The students outside start yelling at Sulley and Mike.

             SQUISHY
      Youre alive!

             DON
      We are so glad youre safe!

As the CDA escort Mike and Sulley out of the room, 
Hardscrabble stares after them in a daze.

She is left standing amongst the scream cans.

The misfits yell after them.

             TERRY
      Hey, wait!

             TERRI
      Whats gonna happen to them?

A familiar CDA agent responds.  Its Roz dressed in CDA 
clothing.

             ROZ
      Thats for the University president 
      to decide, but you can be sure 
      well be watching these two, always

      Congratulations, guys!

             DON
      And thats not the only piece of 
      good news.  Sheri and I are 
      engaged!

Sulley and Mike are confused.

             SULLEY
      Oh...whos Sheri?

      


             SQUISHY        (painfully embarrassed)
      Shes my mom....

Ms. Squibbles steps up and Don puts his arm around her.

                                          147.

             MS. SQUIBBLES
      Well, if it isnt my two favorite 
      fellas!

             DON, MS. SQUIBBLES
        (nuzzling noises)
      Come here, give me some sugar....

             SQUISHY
      So uncomfortable...

             DON
      Awe, come on Scott.  I dont want 
      you to think of me as your new dad, 
      after all, were fraternity 
      brothers first.

             SQUISHY
      This is so weird....

             DON
      Just think of me as your big 
      brother, thats marrying your 
      mother.  Wait, hold on.  Were 
      brothers who share the same mom, 
      slash wife.  Thats worse....

Everyones a little grossed out by Dons words, Don included.

EXT. OOZMA KAPPA FRATERNITY HOUSE - LATER

Mike and Sulley stand by their respective suitcases.

             MIKE
        (somber)
      Well, I guess we should be going 
      now.

             DON
        (getting emotional)
      Promise me youll keep in touch.

He hands Mike and Sulley his business card, which has sales 
scratched out and scare student written in.  Mike looks at 
the card.

      


                                          148.
             MIKE
      Youre the scariest bunch of 
      monsters I have ever met.  Dont 
      let anyone tell you different.

Everyone goes in for a group hug.

EXT. MU FRONT GATE

Mike and Sulley walk toward the gate with their bags.

             SULLEY
      So, what now?

             MIKE
      You know, for the first time in my 
      life, I dont really have a plan.

             SULLEY
      Youre the great Mike Wazowski!  
      Youll come up with something.

             MIKE
      I think its time I leave the 
      greatness to other monsters.  Im 
      okay just being, okay.

Mikes bus pulls up.

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      So long, Sull.

             SULLEY
      So long.

Mike and Sulley shake hands then Mike steps on to the bus.  
The bus takes off.  Sulley watches it leave.

INT. BUS

Mike stares ahead from his seat on the bus. 

ON SULLEY, he looks down, unsure what to do....

Back on Mike, who stares out the window at the campus he is 
leaving....

Suddenly, two blue arms reach into the window, its Sulley.

             SULLEY
      Wazowski!

      


                                          149.
             MIKE
      Aah!

             SULLEY
      WHOA!!

Startled Sulley falls back out the window.

Mike calls up to the bus driver.

             MIKE
      Stop the bus!

EXT. BUS

Mike steps off the bus as Sulley is running down the street.

             MIKE
      Are you crazy?

             SULLEY
      Mike, I dont know a single scarer 
      who can do what you do.  I know 
      everyone sees us together, they 
      think Im the one running the show, 
      but the truth is Ive been riding 
      YOUR coattails since day one.  You 
      made the deal with Hardscrabble, 
      you took a hopeless team and made 
      them champions.  All I did was 
      catch a pig.

             MIKE
        (sotto)
      Technically, I caught the pig.

             SULLEY
        (laughing)
      EXACTLY!  And you think youre just 
      okay?  You pulled off the biggest 
      scare this school has ever seen!

             MIKE
      That wasnt me.

             SULLEY
      That WAS you.  You think I coulda  
      done that without you?  I didnt 
      even bring a pencil on the first 
      day of school!

Mike smiles.

      


                                          150.
Sulleys trying to find the words....

             SULLEY
	(CONTD)
      Mike, youre not scary, not even a 
      little...but you are fearless.

Mikes never heard anyone say that before.

             SULLEY
	(CONTD)
      And if Hardscrabble cant see that, 
      then she can just--

             HARDSCRABBLE
      I can just what?

Sulley turns around, shocked to see Dean Hardscrabble flying 
down behind him.

             HARDSCRABBLE
	(CONTD)
      Careful, Mr. Sullivan, I was just 
      warming up to you.

Sulley looks down awkwardly.

             SULLEY
        (sotto)
      Sorry.

             HARDSCRABBLE
      Well gentlemen, it seems you made 
      the front page again....

Mike looks at the picture, smiles sheepishly.

             HARDSCRABBLE
	(CONTD)
      The two of you did something 
      together that no one has ever done 
      before...you surprised me.  Perhaps 
      I should keep an eye out for more 
      surprises like you in my program.

Its good to hear, but a little late.

             HARDSCRABBLE
	(CONTD)
      But as far as the two of you are 
      concerned, there is nothing I can 
      do for you now.  Except perhaps, 
      wish you luck.

Mike and Sulley are touched.  

             HARDSCRABBLE
	(CONTD)
      And Mr. Wazowski...keep surprising 
      people.

      


                                          151.
Mike watches her fly off, looks at the paper, then smiles and 
looks to Sulley.

             MIKE 
      You know, there is still one way we 
      can work at a scare company.  
      Theyre always hiring in the mail 
      room.

Mike shows Sulley a want ad that reads: Help Wanted: 
Mailroom, Monsters, Inc.  Sulley smiles.

INT. MONSTERS, INCORPORATED - MAIL ROOM

PULL BACK from the MI logo.  Mike is beaming, standing next 
to Sulley in MIs mail room.

             SULLEY
      This is better than I ever 
      imagined!

             MIKE
      I bet we break the all-time record 
      in our first year.

             SULLEY
      Mike, were mail guys.

             MIKE
      I know, Im talking about the 
      record for letters delivered.

A big dump of letters come down the shoot.  Mike and Sulley 
brace themselves.

Mail Manager THE YETI walks by, reprimanding them.

             YETI
      Alright, newbies, quit goofing 
      around.  Ill have you know 
      tampering with the mail is a crime 
      punishable by banishment.

             SULLEY
      Yes, sir!

             MIKE
      Were right on it, Mr. Snowman!
        (to Sulley)
      The team of Wazowski and Sullivan 
      are gonna change the world, 
      starting today!  Say scream!

      


                                          152.
             MIKE, SULLEY

Mike takes a picture of he and Sulley in the mail room.

walks past him to work.

             SULLEY

Mike smiles and steps over the line.

             MIKE
      You better believe it.

INT. SCHOOL CLASSROOM

Slug guy slowly enters a classroom.

             SLUG
        (running, out of breath)
      I made it, my first day of class!

Snap zoom out to an empty lecture hall with a janitor 
sweeping the floor.

             JANITOR
      Ehh, the school years over, son.  
      You missed it.

             SLUG
      Great.

Slug guy turns around and very slowly leaves the lecture 
hall.
