TITLE CARD: JUNE
EXT. TAMPA - MORNING

The wet sun rises up out of the bay, lighting up rows of 
ramshackle houses sandwiched together on the beach.  

INT. MIKES BEACH CONDO - CONTINUOUS

MIKE - 28, good looking, toned - crawls out of bed, hungover.  
He rips off a paper WRISTBAND, stumbles to the bathroom.

INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Mike steps in, turns on the shower - a long row of hair/body 
products line a shelf.  He brushes his teeth, washes.   
Moments later, the curtain is yanked back.

             MIKE
      Jesus, babe, yscared the shit 
      outta me.

A beautiful NAKED WOMAN - AMBER, 30 - steps into the shower.  

             AMBER
        (hugging him)
      Can we just stay here all day?  I 
      think Im still drunk.

             MIKE
      I wish.  Gonna be hot as fuck 
      today. 

             AMBER
      Sweatings good for your skin.

She gives Mike a kiss, grabs the toothbrush from his mouth, 
brushes.   

             MIKE
      Thats gross.  

She smiles.  Mike climbs out of the shower, goes to the 
mirror, starts grooming himself-- 

We see into the bedroom - another NAKED GIRL sleeps in bed.


                                      2.
             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      What are we gonna do about her?

             AMBER
      What was her name again?

             MIKE
        (thinks)
      Penelope?  I dont know, you just 
      kept callin her your little bitch, 
      making her crawl around the room 
      barking.  

Amber laughs, climbs out, towels off.  

             AMBER
      She was fun, whatever her name is. 
        (putting pants on)
      You know Ive got to go commando 
      today because someone ripped my 
      favorite pair of panties off last 
      night.   

             MIKE
      Will you just make sure she gets 
      home and stuff?  

             AMBER
      Ive got to work too, you know.

             MIKE
      I cant have a whole thing when I 
      get home - just...just take care of 
      her. 

             AMBER
      Oh Ill definitely take care of 
      her. Maybe Ill call in sick.  

EXT. MIKES BEACH CONDO - CONTINUOUS

Mike climbs in his SHINY NEW F-150.  A VAN parked next to it 
reads Mikes Mobile Detailing.

INT. MIKES TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

Mike drives, sings along to a CD.    

The TAMPA URBAN SPRAWL speeds by. 


                                      3.
FOR SALE SIGNS, empty storefronts, half-painted billboards, 
half-built houses, ramshackle ads for politicians, lawyers, 
doctors, entrepreneurs.  Typical Florida - a temporary world.  

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

Mike pulls up to a gigantic housing development smack on the 
water in Saint Pete.  Rows of unfinished, vacant homes.  

He gets out, walks towards a TOOL VAN.  On his way he passes 
a busted-up OLD CIVIC - a towel wedged into the window.  
Looks like someones sleeping inside.

A FOREMAN greets Mike at the van.

             FOREMAN
      There he is. Magic Mike. You have a 
      good night?

             MIKE
      For a Thursday. 

Mike starts loading up his tool belt.  He sees someone - THE 
KID, 19, clean-cut good looks - climb out of the Civic.  

             FOREMAN
      Well, today is lucky Friday.

             MIKE
      Yeah?  Hows that?

             FOREMAN
      Cause not only am I gonna forget 
      about the fact that youre fifteen 
      minutes late, but Im bumping you 
      up to lead man - pays four bucks 
      more.  Hows that sound?  

A beat. Mike looks around.

             MIKE
      Wheres George and the rest of the 
      crew?

             FOREMAN
      Took another gig last minute. 
      Fuckers left me high and dry - you 
      believe that?  

Mike looks at the crew climbing up on the roof - a ragtag 
bunch of illegal immigrants.


                                      4.
             MIKE
      Uh huh. Looks to me like someone 
      taught you how to use Craigslist.  

             FOREMAN
      Mikey, dont insult me. Theyre all 
      referrals.  Ive got enough to 
      worry about let alone having union 
      crews barking at me about fuckin 
      benefits.  Benefits - I mean, shit, 
      does it look like 2005 around here?   

             MIKE
      Sal, I aint jumpin up with that 
      crew for no fourteen bucks an hour. 
      No way.   

             FOREMAN
      Dont make me the asshole here, 
      Mike--

             MIKE
      Twenty or I walk.  

             FOREMAN
      You better be fuckin with me.
        (off Mikes stare)
      Sixteen.  

             MIKE
      Qualitys in the details, Sal.  You 
      want these poor people calling Toll 
      Brothers in two months asking why 
      they got a swimming pool in their 
      living room?  Fine by me.  
        (turns to walk)

             FOREMAN
      Eighteen.  Or you can fuck off. For 
      real. 

Mike smiles, heads up for the roof.  

EXT. ROOF - LATER

Mike rolls tar-paper out, shoots it in place with a NAIL GUN.  
He barks at a MEXICAN MAN who steps on some roofing tiles.  

             MIKE
      Senor!  Dont step...those are 
      Cordovas, man.  No los zapatos, 
      comprende? 


The man smiles, backs off.  Mike looks across the roof, sees THE KID awkwardly shooting the nail gun.  Hes an amateur.  

                                      5.

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
        (to himself)
      Christ.

The Kid BLASTS himself in the foot.  

             THE KID
      Fuck!

Mike sighs, walks over.  

             MIKE
      You alright, kid?

             THE KID
        (yanking the nail out)
      Shit grazed my toe!  This guns all 
      fucked up, man.

             MIKE
      Yeah?  

Mike takes the gun, blasts a nail in place.

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      Youre puttin em in here at an 
      angle.  Thats no good.  You want 
      to center the head - like this.
        (shoots another)
      Get some steel toed boots.  And 
      some shorts.  Youre gonna die in 
      this heat if you keep showing up in 
      jeans.   

             THE KID
      Thanks for the tip.  

             MIKE
      When you staple your foot to the 
      truss just holler - names Mike.


Adam.  

Mike goes back to work.  

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - AFTERNOON

The days wrapped.  Mike drops his belt off at the tool van.


                                      6.
             MIKE
        (to the Foreman)
      See you next week, Sal.

             FOREMAN
      Go fuck yourself, Mikey.

Mike walks to his truck.  On the way he sees the Kid trying 
to start his car, but the engine wont turn.  Mike walks up.

             MIKE
      Its overheated.  

             THE KID
      Its a piece of shit is what it is.

             MIKE
      That too.  You live around here? 

             THE KID
      Near Ybor.  

             MIKE
      Might as well give up and come back 
      at night with some coolant.  I can 
      swing you home if you need.  

INT. MIKES TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

Mike and the Kid drive.  

             MIKE
      Take the wheel a sec.

             THE KID
      What?

Mike takes his hands off the wheel.  The Kid instinctively 
grabs it.  Mike turns, reaches into a COOLER behind his seat,  
grabs a BEER, cracks it. 

             MIKE
      Want one?

             THE KID
      Sure.

Mike tosses the kid a beer, takes the wheel.  

             MIKE
      Relax, Kid.  


                                      7.
             THE KID
        (admiring the car)
      How you afford a ride like this on 
      roofing money?  

             MIKE
      Roofing?  Come on, man. Im an 
      entrepreneur.  You watch Mad Money?

The Kid shrugs - whats that?  

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      Check it out.  Everybodys 
      leveraging - lot of opportunities 
      out there, all about timing.    
        (beat)
      So howd you get the gig with Sal?

             THE KID
      Craigslist.  

             MIKE
        (laughs)
      No shit.  Where you from?  

             THE KID
      Citrus Springs.  

             MIKE
      Yall played for states a couple 
      years back, right?   

             THE KID
      I started at strong safety.    

             MIKE
      Yeah?  I was Outside Linebacker.  
      Wellington High Wolverines - down 
      in West Palm.  Still tryin to play?

             THE KID
      Na.  Gave college the college try.  
      Didnt work out.  

             MIKE
      Couldnt resist the lure of the 
      roofing business.  

             THE KID
      Yeah.  That and the lure of my 
      sisters couch.  Take a right in 
      here.

Mike pulls into a small apartment complex off the highway.


                                      8.
             THE KID
	(CONTD)
      Thats me right there.
        (the Kid jumps out)
      Thanks, man.

             MIKE
      No doubt, Kid.  See you around.

Mike watches as the Kid walks up to an apartment door.

EXT. PAIGES APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

The Kid unlocks the door, starts to enter when-- it swings 
back in his face, revealing PAIGE - 26, cute, put-together.

             PAIGE
      You lose your phone or something?

             THE KID
      Na - all good, sis.  

He goes to walk by her but she SLUGS him in the arm. Hard.

             THE KID
	(CONTD)
      Ow!

             PAIGE
      I called you six times, dick.  

             THE KID
        (laughs)
      Ease up, man.

             PAIGE
      Next time you blow off an interview 
      I set up for you, at least call.  

             THE KID
      I told you - no offices.  Ill 
      fuckin kill myself if I have to 
      work in an office.  

             PAIGE
      Just dont embarrass me again or 
      Ill whip your ass. 

             THE KID
        (walking inside)
      Alright, alright.

MIKE watches from his truck, checks out PAIGE - she smacks 
the Kid as he walks back inside. 


EXT. MIKES APARTMENT - DUSK
Mike pulls up outside his house.  An attractive BUSINESSWOMAN 
stands outside his door, BANGING.  He gets out.  

                                      9.

             MIKE
      Can I help you?  

             BUSINESSWOMAN
        (she turns)
      Can you help me?  You were supposed 
      to detail our cars today--

Mike sees her - fuck.

             MIKE
      Oh - yeah, listen I...

             BUSINESSWOMAN
      We paid up front!  What is this?  
      This isnt a business address. 

             MIKE
      Let me explain-- 

             BUSINESSWOMAN
      You dont even remember my name do 
      you?  

             MIKE
      Of course I do...
        (searching)
      Tara.

             BUSINESSWOMAN
        (softens)
      My boss is gonna kill me - he 
      wanted their cars done today.

             MIKE
      Just let me finish.  The crew I put 
      on your job called me an hour ago 
      saying the van wouldnt start - it 
      overheated.  I was like change the 
      filter its not that hard - but 
      the damage was already done, so I 
      had to fire em.  I was literally 
      just about to walk in and call you.  

             BUSINESSWOMAN
      Yeah?  Well, we need a refund.  


                                      10.
             MIKE
      Look, heres what Im gonna do - 
      Im gonna give you 25% off and on 
      Monday Im going to bring in my top 
      crew.  Ill call your boss 
      personally and make sure he knows 
      it was my fault.
        (looks at her dress)
      Is this what you go to work in?

             BUSINESSWOMAN
      Yeah - why?

             MIKE
      How many times a day does your boss 
      hit on you? 

             BUSINESSWOMAN
      Excuse me?

             MIKE
      Just saying.  You look scorched  - 
      what can I get you to drink?  

             BUSINESSWOMAN
      Ive got to go. 

             MIKE
      Cmon, its happy hour.  If I 
      remember youre a vodka-rocks-lemon 
      girl, right? 

She looks at Mike, softens.  Hes got her.  

EXT. CHILIS, YBOR CITY - LATER THAT NIGHT

The Kid walks out of dinner with SUSAN - 20, apple pie cute.  
He pulls out a water bottle full of whiskey, takes a swig, 
passes it to her.

             SUSAN
      Ive got to drive. And maybe you 
      should slow down so I dont have 
      hold your head over a toilet later.

             THE KID
      Come on. Youre not gettin trashed 
      off of one sip.  
        (she doesnt bite)
      I dont want to go to Renees 
      house. Why dont we try to get into 
      Ampitheater?  


                                      11.
             SUSAN
      With our non-existent fake IDs?

             THE KID
      Youre hot - they wont card us.

             SUSAN
        (smiles)
      We told Melissa wed meet her at 
      the movie - we cant just bail.  

             THE KID
      You told her wed meet her.

             SUSAN
      I want to hang with them, OK?

They approach her car in an EMPTY PARKING LOT.  The Kid leans 
into her against the car.

             THE KID
      But I want to hang with you.

He gives her a long kiss.  She likes it.  He starts to put 
his hand down her pants - she abruptly stops him.

             SUSAN
      Come on - stop it.  

The Kid lets out a sigh, takes another swig.  

             SUSAN
	(CONTD)
      Were in a parking lot, Adam. 

             THE KID
        (cold)
      Right.  My bad.

             SUSAN
      Cant you just be nice? 

             THE KID
      Not when all we do is sit around 
      with your friends and talk about 
      fucking internships and sororities 
      and shit.  

             SUSAN
      Whats that supposed to mean?

             THE KID
      Youre being boring.  And your 
      friends are boring.


                                      12.
That hurt.

             SUSAN
      Maybe we should both just go home.  

             THE KID
      Good.  I need to jerk off.  Again.

He slams the car door, turns and walks off. 

             SUSAN
      Adam!

EXT. YBOR CITY - MOMENTS LATER

The Kid walks by some newspaper stands, KNOCKS them to the 
ground.

He walks through a row of BARS, packed with attractive women 
and guys with money to spend - a better life.   

He turns a corner, sees a LINE of people outside AMPITHEATER - 
a giant, popular club.  He walks up.

EXT. AMPITHEATER - CONTINUOUS

The Kid gets in line, checks out some of the girls, taps an 
attractive looking girl on the shoulder.

             THE KID
      Hey - whos spinning tonight?

She turns - is he underage?  

             ATTRACTIVE GIRL
      Uh, I dont know.  Sorry.  

             THE KID
        (nods)
      Cool.

The Kid sees BOUNCERS CHECKING ID, letting more connected 
people through the rope.  Its a lost cause.

Then--  The Kid sees MIKE walking through the line with a 
couple hot girls.  The bouncer lets him right through.

             THE KID
	(CONTD)
      Hey Mike!  

Mike doesnt hear.  The Kid budges in towards the rope.


                                      13.
             THE KID
	(CONTD)
      Yo Mike!

Mike turns, sees the Kid.

             THE KID
	(CONTD)
      Could you help me out?  

             MIKE
      Kid?  The hell you doin here?  

             THE KID
      Tryin to get in.

             MIKE
      They got those new ID scanners at 
      the door...unless you brought your 
      skirt I think youre kind of 
      fucked.

A beat. The Kid looks around, bummed.

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      How bout this - I'll get you in, 
      but you gotta return the favor.  
      Any girl I point out you gotta go 
      talk to her, no questions asked.  

             THE KID
      Seriously?  No problem.  

             MIKE
      And you gotta swear thisll be the 
      last time you rock those old ass 
      sneaks.  Youll get nowhere in here 
      with those things.
        (off the Kids look)
      Well cmon!
        (to the bouncer)
      Darius, I got one more with me.

Mike brings the Kid through the rope.  They go into the club.

INT. AMPITHEATER CLUB - CONTINUOUS

It Feels So Good by Sonique blasts.  

A monstrous two level space packed to the brim - a rotating 
dance floor in the center (GLOW-DANCERS performing on it), 
pulsing lights, rocking bass, scantily clad women.  Mike 
introduces the Kid to the girls he walked in with.  


                                      14.
             MIKE
      Kid, meet Ruby and Portia.  Ladies, 
      meet the Kid.  

Mike greets a HOSTESS with a kiss - she escorts the group to 
the VIP floor.  Portia takes the Kids hand, leads him.  He 
checks out all the hot chicks, every one says hi to Mike.

They get to a TABLE full of BOTTLES.

INT. AMPITHEATER, VIP TABLE - CONTINUOUS

             MIKE
      Pour yourself a drink, Kid.  

             THE KID
        (hesitating)
      Its free?

             MIKE
      Dont worry - youre gonna earn 
      your keep.  
        (to the girls)
      What do you ladies think?  

             RUBY
      Oh yeah, cougarsll eat him up.  

             MIKE
      You hear that, Kid?  Thats a 
      quality endorsement.  

             THE KID
        (to the girls)
      What do you guys do?  

The girls look at each other and laugh.  

             MIKE
      Anytime you meet a girl named after 
      a flower, a stone, or a car, dont 
      bother asking what she does.

Mike points out a group of college-age women at the bar 
waiting to get a drink.

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      See that group over there?  You 
      drink free the rest of the night if 
      you get them to come join us for a 
      cocktail.  Think you can handle 
      that?  


                                      15.
             THE KID
      Yeah, no problem.  What do I say?

             MIKE
      What do you say?  Jesus, have you 
      ever talked to a girl before?  Be 
      creative - just make it happen. 

The Kid walks over to the girls.  Mike watches - after a 
moment the Kid walks back empty handed.  

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      What happened, big guy?  

             THE KID
      They werent into it.   

             MIKE
      No - you just didnt sell it right. 

             THE KID
      They didnt want to be bothered.  
      Whats this for, anyway?

             MIKE
      Bothered?  Look at what theyre 
      wearing - theyre asking to get 
      bothered.  Go back over there, 
      apologize for being a bumbling 
      idiot.  Tell them that your boy is 
      a friend of the owner and hed like 
      them all to come over to his table 
      and have a drink off his bottles.  

             THE KID
      I dont know, man.     

             MIKE
      We made a deal, Kid. You want to be  
      in here, or you want to be outside?  

The Kid gives in, walks back over, talks to them.  In moments 
the girls abandon the bar, come over to Mikes table.    

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      Welcome, ladies - grab a shot.  
      They just give me all these things - 
      I cant drink em by myself.  

Mike pours shots - the girls take them.  Mike raises a glass. 

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      To our children.  May they have 
      rich fuckin parents.


                                      16.
The girls laugh, take the shots.  

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      Yall go to USF?
        (off their nod)
      So its summer break - Ill drink 
      to that!

Mike lines up more shots.

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      Whatre yall doing tomorrow night?

             COLLEGE GIRL
      Wouldnt you like to know?

             MIKE
      I would, actually.  Its a little 
      embarrassing, but if yall like to 
      get a little crazy you should come 
      see a show.   

Mike pulls out a few FLYERS from his back pocket - hands them 
to the girls.  They look at them, then at Mike.  

             GIRL
        (lights up)
      Seriously?   Yeah, maybe well come 
      check you out.

The Kid looks at one of the flyers - its for a MALE DANCE 
REVUE.  Mike sees another GROUP OF GIRLS through the crowd.  

             MIKE
      And on that note Im going to leave 
      you in the kind hands of my good 
      friend here.

Mike pulls out more FLYERS, hands a small stack to the Kid.

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      Put your drinks on my tab.  Just 
      pass em all out - and have fun.  
        (off the Kids look)
      And here you were thinking roofing 
      was your only talent.

Mike leaves, strikes up a conversation with another girl.  
The Kid turns back to the college girls.

             COLLEGE GIRL
      What are you waiting for?  Pour us 
      some more, handsome.


                                      17.
On the Kid, music pulsing - he pours more shots.  The girls 
down them, bring the Kid to his feet, start DANCING.  

On the Kid, grinding with the girls.  This is the life.

INT. PAIGES APARTMENT - THE NEXT MORNING

The Kid lies passed out, snoring on the couch.  Paige walks 
up in scrubs, drops a couple ICE CUBES down his back.  

             THE KID
        (shooting up)
      Shit!  What the hell?

             PAIGE
      Its seven-thirty!

             THE KID
      Seriously?  Fuck.  

The Kid goes to the sink, splashes some water on his face, 
pulls on some black pants and a collared shirt.  

             PAIGE
      If you cant get up for work, 
      howre you gonna afford to make it 
      off this couch?  And you smell like 
      a brewery.   

The Kid lifts his armpit up to Paige.  

             PAIGE
	(CONTD)
      Get out of here!  

EXT. DILLARDS DEPARTMENT STORE - MOMENTS LATER

The Kids car putters into the parking lot.  He blow dries 
his hair in the AC, trims stubble with a disposable razor.

                                  CUT TO:

A timecard punches in - 7:46 AM

INT. DILLARDS - MOMENTS LATER

The Kid walks behind the perfume station.  He gets a couple 
samplers out, starts priming the air.  

JERRY - 50, bald, ambiguously gay, the boss - strides up.


                                      18.
             JERRY
      Seven forty-six.  Thats a whole 
      hour of late time coming off your 
      check.  And only two strikes left.  

             THE KID
      Im sorry.  My car broke down.  

             JERRY
      Look at this display.  The eau de 
      vivre doesnt go next to the bath 
      salts. 

The Kid starts rearranging the stuff.  Jerry eyes the Kid.

             JERRY
	(CONTD)
      We got a new CK scrub in today.  So 
      when a lady walks by you offer to 
      bring her by the wash basin. 
        (grabs the Kids hand)
      Then take them by the hand and rub 
      the lotion in like this.

He gently rubs lotion on the Kids hand.  The Kid pulls away.

             JERRY
	(CONTD)
      Tuck your shirt in tight.  I need 
      you clean-cut.    

Jerry walks off.  The Kid steams.  

EXT. DILLARDS - AFTERNOON

The Kid walks back to his car - another shitty day.  He opens 
up a paycheck - $198.63 after taxes for the week.  He sighs, 
puts the keys in, looks at the passenger seat.

One of Mikes FLYERS sits on the floor.  Are you ready to 
dance?  THE KINGS OF TAMPA.  XQUISITE.  This Sat.  

On the Kid.

EXT. XQUISITE - DUSK

The Kids car pulls up into a strip-mall parking lot.  A 
large sign outside a storefront reads XQUISITE.

He walks up to the front doors -- LOCKED.  A hand-written 
sign says Doors open at 8.


                                      19.
The Kid sees a CAR drive around the back of the club.  

MOMENTS LATER:

The Kid walks around to the back of the club.  A buff, 
monstrous guy - BIG DICK RICHIE, 35 - smokes against a wall.

             THE KID
      Hey.  Im looking for Mike.

             BIG DICK RICHIE
        (takes a drag)
      No dudes, man.  

             THE KID
      What?

             BIG DICK RICHIE
      No.  Dudes.

             THE KID
      Im a friend.  Is Mike in there?   

Richie flicks his cigarette on the ground, walks through a 
door, calls out for Mike.  The Kid waits.  Then, Mike pops 
out the door.  Hes dressed in a cut-off TUXEDO.  

             MIKE
      Kid?  The hell you doing here?

             THE KID
      Hey man - thanks for last night.

             MIKE
      No problem.  Good to see youre 
      alive - you were smacked!

             THE KID
      Yeah.

             MIKE
      So whats up?

             THE KID
      I uhhh...this is awkward--

             MIKE
        (uh oh)
      Whats up, man?  

             THE KID
      I was wondering if yall had any 
      open jobs or anything.  


                                      20.
             MIKE
        (phew!)
      Oh...shit.  I thought you mightve 
      been about to gay out on me.  No 
      offense, pro homo and all but-- you 
      know.  So...jobs?  Like what, more 
      flyers?  Come back next week, man.   

             THE KID
      No.  I mean, like as a dancer or 
      something.  

             MIKE
        (laughs)
      A dancer?  Come on--  

But the Kid doesnt flinch - hes desperately serious.  Mike 
looks the Kid over a moment.  

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      Out of curiosity - how crazy are 
      you?  Scale of one to ten.  

             THE KID
      Nine.

             MIKE
      OK.  You really want a job, you 
      gotta talk to Dallas.   

INT. XQUISITE - CONTINUOUS

Mike leads the Kid down a hallway, through a small DRESSING 
ROOM where four STRIPPERS prepare for the nights show.  

             MIKE
      Guys, this is the Kid.

All the strippers say hey.  Mike introduces each one to the 
Kid by name.    

BIG DICK RICHIE mends a GIGANTIC THONG with a sewing machine.    

KEN - 38, just like a Ken doll - primps his hair in a mirror.  

TARZAN - 50, long mane - lifts weights.  

TITO - suave, 20s, Puerto Pican - lathers NAIR on his legs.  

They walk down a hallway and finally out to--


INT. XQUISITE STAGE - CONTINUOUS
A slick, muscular man with a serious tan - Dallas, 40 - 
stands on stage, practices BLOWING FIRE from a torch.  He 
sees Mike.

                                      21.

             DALLAS
      Theyll eat it up, man.  Im gonna 
      give the routine to Tarzan if you 
      dont want it.  What do you think?

             MIKE
      Im good.  Its cool, though.

             DALLAS
        (looks at the Kid)
      Whos this?

             MIKE
      This is...
        (whats his name again?)
      The Kid.  He wants a job.  

Dallas looks the Kid over, laughs.

             DALLAS
      As what - a waitress?

             MIKE
      He wants to dance.

             DALLAS
      You kidding me?  What are you, 160?  
      What am I supposed to do with that? 

             THE KID
      I can dance.  

             DALLAS
        (hates that word)
      Dance?  You gotta perform, man.  
        (lifts up his shirt)
      You see this?  You gotta have a V-8 
      under the hood if you want to hit 
      the track, you dig?  

             MIKE
      Hes a good kid, Dallas - just 
      looking to pick up some extra cash.  
      Maybe he could work the door--  

             DALLAS
        (to the Kid)
      Take off your shirt.


                                      22.
             DALLAS
	(CONT'D)
        (the Kid hesitates)
      Go on--

The Kid takes off his shirt.  Hes more ripped than expected.

             DALLAS
	(CONTD)
      Turn around.

The kid turns around.

             DALLAS
	(CONTD)
      Come back when youre ready to be a 
      professional.  

             MIKE
      Were having to set up our own acts 
      as it is.  Maybe he could host, run 
      the props-- 

             DALLAS
        (looks the Kid over)
      How old are you?

             THE KID
      Nineteen.  

             DALLAS
        (to Mike)
      Shit, Mike.  Can we even have 
      nineteen year-olds working here?  

Mike shrugs.  

             THE KID
      Fuck that - I dont look nineteen.  

Dallas looks at Mike - the Kids got attitude.  

             DALLAS
      Listen, Kid. This isnt a joke, and 
      its not a fucking hobby.  Its a 
      serious business.  Someday were 
      gonna be in Vegas, New York, Dubai.  
      Only my A-team makes it on to that 
      stage.  I dont need some teenage 
      liability around here.    
        (takes a moment)
      I like your passion.  And you got 
      my number one here vouching for 
      you.  So Ill make you a deal.  We 
      try you out as a host for one 
      night, see how the ladies like you.  
      I'll toss you a hundred bucks.  
      After that, well see.  Hows that?


                                      23.
             THE KID
      When would I start?

             DALLAS
      Tonight.

INT. XQUISITE - LATER

Girls stream into the club.  The Kid greets them.

             THE KID
      Welcome, ladies - take a seat 
      wherever youd like.  

             RANDOM WOMAN
      Oh I will, cutie pie.  

Mike comes up behind the Kid.

             MIKE
      Come on - five minute warning.

Mike walks the Kid back to the dressing room.  

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      Hostings easy.  You just gotta 
      make sure every acts set-up right.

INT. DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

They walk in.  The strippers oil-up, do push-ups.  Big Dick 
Richie pumps up his dick with a gigantic PENIS PUMP.

             MIKE
      We do a group act.  Then solos.  
      Then the hot seats.  The acts go 
      smooth, we jack up the price of the 
      hot seats.  Thats when the tips 
      come rolling in.  

TARZAN shoots some steroids into his arm.  Theres so much 
muscle that the fluid comes squirting right back out.  

             THE KID
      And if they dont?

             MIKE
      You dont know what its like to 
      get booed till youre booed by a 
      pack of three hundred hormonal 
      women.  


                                      24.
Mike points to a series of PILES of various PROPS.  

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      You go one by one, starting with 
      the first.  Bring em out on stage 
      just before each act starts.  

             THE KID
      OK.  But do I...

TOBIAS - 30, eccentric club DJ - walks up, bro-hugs Mike.

             TOBIAS
      What up, dawg!  Yall ready to 
      pussy tease and make some cheese?

             MIKE
      Tobias - the Kid.  Kid - Tobias, 
      resident DJ.  Hell give you the 
      signal before he cues up each song. 

Tobias holds up a LITTLE BOTTLE of liquid - GHB.

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      In a minute - save some.   
        (to the Kid)
      When the lights go off hell crank 
      the fog machine.  Thats when you 
      bring out the first set.  The one 
      thing you need to remember is...

             DALLAS
	(O.S.)
        (over the PA)
      Alright alright, ladies.  How you 
      doing tonight?  
        (girls SCREAM)
      Are you ready get wild, get crazy, 
      get downright dirty?  
        (more SCREAMS)
      I cant hear you!  

             MIKE
      Thats my cue.  
        (off the Kids reaction)
      Relax.  Youll do fine.

Mike walks off.  A bass drum echoes over the sound system.

             DALLAS 
        (into mic)
      Did yall come here to see some 
      hard bodies?  Well, here we go... 
      Reach into those purses and show 
      some love.  


             DALLAS 	(CONT'D)
      Steppin right up to that center 
      stage, please welcome the cock-
      rockin Kings Of Tampa! 

                                      25.

The lights shut off and the Fog machine spits to life.  The 
strippers line up, dressed in TOP GUN outfits. 

             MIKE
      Kid - go!  

The Kid grabs the first pile of props - a group of airplane 
LIGHT STICKS - runs them out on stage.  Girls SCREAM. 

INT. STAGE - CONTINUOUS

Kenny Loggins Danger Zone blasts

The dancers come out and do a Top Gun routine.  Big Dick 
Richie waves glow sticks directing stripper-traffic.

The chorus kicks in - Highway to the Danger Zone...

The strippers RIP OFF their jackets, revealing bare chests, 
start into a choreographed routine.  Mikes at the center of 
the group, clearly the best dancer.

The song transitions to The Weather Girls ITS RAINING MEN. 
The dancers work the crowd then exit as the girls go wild, 
MAKE IT RAIN with dollar bills.  

             DALLAS
        (over the PA)
      Alright, alright - thats what Im 
      talkin about, show some love!  Now 
      every one of you lovely ladies was 
      once just a little girl, playing 
      with her Barbie Dolls.  Remember?   
      Now I want you to close your eyes, 
      and put your hands together - cause 
      we got a special treat for you 
      tonight.  

Tobias CUES the Kid.  He rushes the second pile of props - a 
small rolling KITCHENETTE and a LOVE-SEAT - out to the stage.

Small Town Girl by Journey plays.

             DALLAS
	(CONTD)
      I need an especially lovely Barbie 
      to join us up on the stage.

A handful of girls SCREAM.  Dallas picks out a BLONDE, brings 
her up to the kitchenette.


                                      26.
             DALLAS
	(CONTD)
      Its dinner time, girl.  Dont burn 
      the pork chops...cause Daddys 
      coming home.  Please welcome to the 
      stage - your very own, KEN!

KEN comes out dressed in preppy clothes.  The girl stands at 
the stove.  Ken begins a playful routine that culminates with 
him taking it all off and humping her on the love-seat.  The 
crowd goes CRAZY.

MORE ROUTINES FLASH BY--

--BIG DICK RICHIE does a silhouette dance - the girls all 
GASP at the silhouette of his gigantic penis.  

--TITO does a FIREMAN routine.  As the Kid rushes out he 
drops a prop FIRE HYDRANT, breaking the top off.  Dallas 
glares at him as Tito takes the stage.  

The lights dim - fog blows through purple spotlights.

MOMENTS LATER:

             DALLAS
	(CONTD)
        (over P.A.)
      His fame has travelled far and 
      wide.  But his art remains a 
      mystery.  Please welcome, our 
      feature presentation, the Houdini 
      of the dance floor.  Magic Miiiike! 

Ushers My Way plays as Mike steps out.  He begins a slow, 
sexy routine - hes an incredible dancer, the girls freak!

Mike exits the stage and a loud TARZAN-HOWL screams over the 
speakers, followed by AC/DCs Thunderstruck.  

                                    CUT:

             DALLAS
	(CONTD)
      Alright ladies lets pump up the 
      volume and get ready to swing. 
      Please welcome to the stage, our 
      very own...Tarzan!

But no one comes to the stage.  

             DALLAS
	(CONTD)
      Steppin up to that center 
      stage...Tarzan!

Still nothing.  The crowd quiets.  Dallas rushes back-stage.


                                      27.
INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

             DALLAS
      Where the fuck is he?

Dallas sees MIKE and the others gathered around TARZAN on the 
floor.  Hes groggy, talking to himself, not getting up.

             KEN
      Hes Gd out, boss.

             DALLAS
      Jesus Christ - this guy.
        (leans down)
      Im losin serious money out there 
      right now, you piece of shit!  

Dallas KICKS Tarzan.  Tarzan GROANS, talks nonsense.   

             MIKE
      Hey hey - lets figure this out.   

             DALLAS
      We gotta send someone.  Ken - why 
      dont you take the S&M routine?

             KEN
        (insecure)
      I, uh, Im really not comfortable 
      with it yet.  

The crowd BOOOOS outside.

             DALLAS
      Shit.  Richie - how bout the fire-
      breathing thing?

             RICHIE
      I got, like, a fire issue.  A 
      pho...bia.   

             MIKE
      Why dont you send the Kid out? 

On the Kid - not what he expected.  

             DALLAS
      This aint the time for jokes.  
      Were professionals here, Mike.

Dallas goes back to thinking.  Mike looks at the Kid, slips 
out, takes the MIC, goes onto stage


                                      28.
INT. STAGE - CONTINUOUS

             MIKE
        (to the audience)
      Ladies, were sorry for the delay, 
      but were taking our time cause 
      weve got a real treat for you 
      tonight--

Dallas looks out at Mike - what the fuck is he doing?

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      A real live virgin is here in the 
      house!  How would you beautiful 
      ladies like to do a virgin tonight?

The girls CHEER, CLAP!  The Kid freezes...

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      Thats what I thought.  Now - this 
      is just between me and you.  But 
      you ladies are really gonna have to 
      make some noise cause hes never 
      done this before and hes a little 
      shy.  So...lets hear it.

They ERUPT!  Mike walks off.  

INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

Mike walks up to the group, looks at the Kid.

             MIKE
      You said you wanted to dance, Kid.  
      Go show em what you got.

Dallas gives Mike a screw you look, but the crowds made up 
his mind.  He holds out a THONG to the Kid.  

             DALLAS
      Throw your clothes on over this.

On the Kid.  

Madonnas LIKE A VIRGIN plays.  The Kid goes out on stage 
in his clothes.  He awkwardly starts to dance - the crowd 
laughs a bit.  Dallas puts his head in his hands.  Then...

You make me feel shiny and new...Like a Virgin...

MOMENTS LATER:


                                      29.
The Kid starts to seriously move.  Hes not a bad dancer.  As 
he dances he starts awkwardly slipping out of his clothes.  
The crowd EATS IT UP.  

He dances up to a group of YOUNG GIRLS on a BIRTHDAY PARTY.

             MIKE
	(O.S.)
        (over the P.A.)
      Thats right, birthday girls - show 
      our little virgin some love.

The girls drop dollars down the kids pants, grope him as he 
strips down to his thong.  Mike laughs.

The Kid dances right up on one girl - they meet eyes for a 
long moment, then the Kid leans down and KISSES HER, sending 
the crowd into a FRENZY--

Tobias cues up YMCA.

             DALLAS
	(O.S.)
        (over P.A.)
      Alright ladies, lets get these hot-
      seats going!  Five bucks a pop to 
      get popped by Floridas finest.

The other dancers come out on stage and set-up the lap-dance 
hot seats to close out the show.  Mike walks by the Kid.

             MIKE
      Welcome to the crazy club, Kid.    

Mike signals for the kid to follow him into the crowd.  He 
mimics Mike and dances for tips in the crowd.

INT. DRESSING ROOM - LATER

Everyone gets dressed.  The strippers congratulate the Kid.  

             TITO
      On the real, Kid.  I thought you 
      was DOA.  That kiss - damn!  They 
      was pouring out they purses.

             BIG DICK RICHIE
        (serious)
      You gotta watch out for herpes.

             TITO
      Richie found out the hard way.

The Kid laughs as Dallas walks up.


                                      30.
             DALLAS
      Never kiss the girls.  Thats 
      performer 101, Kid.  
        (off the Kids look)
      But tonight - you took a chance and 
      it paid off.  I like it.  

Dallas hands the Kid a stack of MONEY.  

             DALLAS
	(CONTD)
      Thats $465.  Get ready to work - 
      wont be that easy every time.  

The Kid stares at the money - holy shit.  

             MIKE
	(O.S.)
      Kid!  Come out here.

The Kid gets up, walks out to the stage.  MIKE stands there 
with the group of BIRTHDAY GIRLS.

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      Were all gonna go see DJ Gemeni 
      spin at the Amp.  Wanna come?  

             THE KID
      Sure.

             MIKE
      Funny thing - I was talking to 
      these lovely ladies here, and this 
      one was too embarrassed to tell you 
      herself, but shes got only one 
      birthday wish this year.  
        (whispers to the Kid)
      To fuck a virgin.  

The girls giggle.  Mike winks.

INT. AMPITHEATER CLUB - LATER

Mike, the Kid, Tobias, and the BIRTHDAY GIRLS DANCE and 
PARTY.  Mike makes out with one of the girls.  The Kid grinds 
with the birthday girl.

INT. VIP ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

The BIRTHDAY GIRL goes down on the Kid.   

             THE KID
        (sincere)
      Happy birthday.


                                      31.
She laughs.  On the Kid - this could be the greatest night of 
his life.

EXT. TAMPA BAY BRIDGE - SUNRISE

Mike, the Kid, Tobias, and the girls drunkenly watch the sun 
rise out of the bay.  Everyone lets out a SIGH when it rises.    

             MIKE 
      Shhhh...  Just watch.  Thats over 
      five million light miles away, man. 
      The surface is like...ten thousand 
      degrees.

Its a beautiful sight.  Then, the Kid fake-pushes one of the 
girls off the bridge.  She squeals.  

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      Careful, Kid.

             THE KID
      No ones gonna fall.  

             MIKE
        (gives a crazy smile)
      Oh yeah?

Mike climbs up on the railing.  Its a big drop.

             THE KID
      Bullshit.

Then, Mike does a BACKFLIP off the edge.  The girls shriek.  
He splashes down in the water.  

The Kids shocked.  He looks down - Mike comes up for air--

The Kid climbs up on the railing, looks down--  Its a BIG 
DROP.

             GIRLS
      No, dont!

The Kid closes his eyes, then--

LEAPS OFF, sailing down into the water with a SPLASH!

EXT. BAY - CONTINUOUS

The Kid comes up for air.  He and Mike float back to shore. 


             THE KID      We should be best friends.

             MIKE
        (laughs)
      OK, Kid.  

                                      32.

                                 FADE TO:

INT. MIKES BEACH CONDO - THE NEXT MORNING

Mike wakes up, lets the BIRTHDAY GIRLS out the front door.

He goes out into the living room, grabs a beer from the 
fridge, cracks it.  He takes another one, walks over to the 
couch where THE KID sleeps, lays it on the Kids neck.

             THE KID
        (waking up)
      Shit!  

             MIKE
      Rise and shine, soldier.  Got 
      practice today.  

             THE KID
      My head hurts.  

             MIKE
      Well, drink your medicine then.  

The Kid cracks his beer, looks around Mikes place - its 
nice.  Mike notices some COLLECTION LETTERS on the table, 
trashes them.  

             THE KID
      Nice digs.  

             MIKE
      I wanted it to feel kind of 
      industrial-meets-beach-chic, you 
      know? 

             THE KID
        (no)
      For sure.  You seen my shoes?

             MIKE
      By the door.  Floors walnut - 
      yall scuffed it up last night.   

             THE KID
      Shit.  What happened to the girls?  


                                      33.
             MIKE
      She left her number on the table.

The Kid gets up, admires a unique looking KITCHEN TABLE.  
Some books on penny stocks on top of it.  

             THE KID
      Whats this?

Mike comes over, puts the Kids beer on a coaster.

             MIKE 
      Im looking into the penny stock 
      game.  Lot of volatility there.   
        (off the Kids look)
      Oh - the table?  Its an old 
      wrought iron door, washed up during 
      a hurricane.  Fashioned some engine 
      parts to it from my foster dads 
      chevy.

             THE KID
      You made it?
        (Mike nods)
      Damn.  You should sell these 
      things.  

             MIKE
      Thats the plan.  Gonna open my own 
      shop someday.  Mikes Custom 
      Cuts.  Market just ain't hit that 
      sweet spot yet.  Soon the banksll 
      start making the kind of 
      competitive loans I want - thats 
      when Ill swoop in with my rain-nor-
      shine money.   

Mike takes a WAD OF CASH from last night, tucks it in a WALL 
SAFE.  

             THE KID 
      Whats that?

             MIKE
      Cash I dont touch come rain-nor-
      shine.  Got like seven grand tucked 
      away, only need a few more to make 
      the down payment.  

             THE KID
      What about the club?


                                      34.
             MIKE
      Its a band-aid to get me there, 
      like everything else.  Check this 
      out-

Mike flicks on the TV, plays a DVD.  An INFOMERCIAL comes on 
screen - MIKE, dressed in a suit, talks to camera.

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
        (on TV)
      Two years ago I was making thirty K 
      a year as a hospital administrator.  
      Now, thanks to Elliot Partners and 
      their revolutionary Guide to Day 
      Trading At Home, Im living 
      here...
        (reveal hes in a mansion 
         with a beautiful family)
      And banking over $300,000 annually.  
      Ill tell you how I did it, and how 
      you can too.  All it takes is one 
      simple phone call...

Mike mutes the sound.

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      Dallas hooked it up.  Aired on 
      every local network, and cable.  

             THE KID
      Damn.  You must be flush from that 
      shit, whatamacall...residuals.

             MIKE
      I did alright, yeah.  You ready to 
      rock?  

             THE KID
      Yeah - can you run me home real 
      quick to change?  

INT. PAIGES APARTMENT - MORNING

A doorbell rings.  Paige comes to the door, opens it - 

The Kid and Mike - laughing, beers in hand.   

             PAIGE
      Oh Jesus - I dont even want to 
      know.


                                      35.
             THE KID
        (walking in)
      Hey, sis.  This is my friend, Mike.  
      This is Paige.  

Mike and Paige meet eyes - hes immediately taken with her.  

             MIKE
      Pleasures all mine.  
        (notices her scrubs)
      Nurse?

             PAIGE
      Medical assistant.  I get to file 
      all their paperwork.   

             MIKE
      Way cooler.

             PAIGE
      Exactly.

             THE KID
      Be back in a sec.     

The Kid walks off.  Mike looks around the apartment. Paige 
doesnt know what to make of him.

             MIKE
      Did a nice job in here.  Wouldnt 
      have gone contemporary with the 
      kitchen set though.

             PAIGE
      What?

             MIKE
      Gives it a kinda cold feel.  
      Something naturalist would make it 
      more lived-in.  

             PAIGE
      Thanks for the tip.  Im sorry, how 
      do you know my brother again?

             MIKE
      Work.

             PAIGE
      Dillards?

             MIKE
      My roofin crew.  The rest, as they 
      say, is history.


                                      36.
             PAIGE
      Im sure.    

             MIKE
      Im an entrepreneur, though - got a 
      few businesses I manage right now.  

             PAIGE
      Thats nice. 

Mike sits down at the table.

             MIKE
      So the Kid said something about 
      breakfast--

On Paige - he better be joking.

             PAIGE
      Well, he must still be drunk cause 
      I dont cook fuckin breakfast.

Mike laughs - unexpected.

             MIKE
      I didnt mean you cookin it.  He 
      said you liked breakfast so we were 
      gonna swing by IHOP on our way into 
      town.  

             PAIGE
      Oh.  I--

             MIKE
      Its cool. Im just gonna wait 
      outside with the rest of the 
      breakfast lovers of the world.  
      Maybe Ill see ya around though?

Mike extends his hand.  Paige shakes it.  

             PAIGE
      Maybe.

INT. GOLDS GYM - LATER THAT DAY

The strippers rehearse in the mirror-walled aerobics studio. 
MUSIC plays from a BOOMBOX.  Dallas pulls the Kid aside.


                                      37.
             DALLAS
      Im giving you the virgin routine.  
      Once you nail it Ill throw you 
      another one.  Now lets see it -  
      take it off.  

Dallas cues music.  The Kid looks around - its a public gym.

             DALLAS
	(CONTD)
      Lets go - take off your clothes!  

The Kid awkwardly starts dancing, taking off his clothes.  
Dallas watches closely. 

             DALLAS
	(CONTD)
        (stops the music)
      Whatre you, a goddamn twelve-year- 
      old in a locker room?  You cant 
      just pull your clothes off - youve 
      got to seduce,  man!  Last time you 
      got lucky cause Mike set you up so 
      nice.  You gotta commit!  When 
      youre up there you gotta believe 
      that youre inside every one of em.

Dallas stands inches away from the mirror, does a BODY ROLL.  

             DALLAS
	(CONTD)
      See that?  Its like hitting the g-
      spot.  Youre not just stripping - 
      youre fulfilling their wildest 
      fantasies.  You gotta be the 
      husband they wish they had, the guy 
      they dreamed about that never came 
      along.  Now, take a breath, then 
      fuck this mirror like you mean it.  

Dallas cues the music.  The Kid practices.  Dallas walks up 
behind him, grabs the Kids hips, starts to control his speed 
and direction.  Mike looks over and laughs - so weird.

The strippers pack up.  Dallas walks with Mike and the Kid.

                                   LATER:

             DALLAS
	(CONTD)
      You gotta start hittin the 
      supplements and bulking up.  Well 
      get you on a regular routine.

             THE KID
      Like what - creatine?  


                                      38.
             DALLAS
      Fuck creatine. Im talking 
      rhaponticum carthenoids, anabolics.  
      Im working on an exclusive brand 
      with the clubs name.  My top 
      dancers, like Mike here, will get a 
      taste of equity.  

             THE KID
      Cool.

             DALLAS
      Now lets get you some hardware. 

INT. THONG SHOP - DAY

Dallas, Mike, and the Kid walk through a small room full of 
male/female stripper clothes.  An OLD LADY with a major tan 
and bright gold hair tailors thongs at a sewing machine.  

             DALLAS
      Not all thongs are created equal.  
      Its like underwear - one fits 
      different from another.

The Kid scans the rows of thongs.  Some of them with long, 
built-in penis pouches.  Others with diamond studs.

             DALLAS
	(CONTD)
      Stay away from those elephant 
      socks, Kid.  Youll want a lively 
      color for the younger girls.  
      Mikes in blue, so...

             MIKE
      Go red.

             DALLAS
      Bingo.  
        (picks out a red one)
      And youll want a black one in case 
      I throw you an S&M routine or 
      something.

Dallas holds a thong up in front of the Kids crotch.

             DALLAS
	(CONTD)
      Darla - what do you think?

The old woman looks up at the Kid, gives a THUMBS UP.

             DALLAS
	(CONTD)
      Winner winner chicken dinner.


                                      39.
They go to checkout with the old woman.  

             DALLAS
	(CONTD)
      Shit - forgot my wallet.

Mike gives Dallas a look, pulls out his CREDIT CARD.  The 
woman swipes it.  A beat. 

             DARLA
      Declined.  

             MIKE
      Huh?  Oh, just got it in the mail, 
      forgot to authorize it.

             THE KID
      Its cool - I got it.

The Kid pulls out his wallet, pays.

INT. PAIGES APARTMENT, BATHROOM - NIGHT

The Kid shaves his legs in the tub with Paiges pink razor - 
he's never done it before - it's awkward.  

PAIGE walks into the apartment, hears the Kid in the 
bathroom, goes to the door, yells over the shower noise.  

             PAIGE
      Hey, will you be out by seven?  
      Pauls driving up from Orlando.

             THE KID
      Yeah - Im leaving in a bit.

She turns to walk away, when something catches her eye -- a 
big Rubbermaid BOX on the floor.  She looks at it...

Its packed with THONGS, COMBAT BOOTS, cut-off JEAN SHORTS, 
KNEE-HIGH SOCKS, etc.  What the hell?

             PAIGE
        (yells)
      What is this shit?

             THE KID
      What?   

             PAIGE
      I said what is--

Paige opens the door-- 


             THE KID      Hey!  

She sees the Kid shaving his legs. 

                                      40.

             PAIGE
      What the hell are you doing?

             THE KID
      Nothin.  Get out of here!

             PAIGE
      Are you...?  Youre gettin all the 
      hair in my drain!

             THE KID
      Im sorry!  

             PAIGE
      What are you shaving your fucking 
      legs for?  

             THE KID
      Would you get the fuck outta here?  

             PAIGE
      No.  I want to know.    

Beat.

             THE KID
      I joined a swim team.

             PAIGE 
      Fuck you.

Paige turns the shower water on COLD, points it at the Kid.

             THE KID
      Alright, alright!  Jesus Christ! 
      Im doing some dancing. 

             PAIGE
      Dancing?  What kind of dancing?

             THE KID
      The kind of dancing where I rub my 
      nuts on girls chests for money -  
      that kind of dancing.  

             PAIGE
      Whaaaat?  Oh no.  No.  
        (laughs)
      You cant even dance.


                                      41.
             THE KID
      How would you know?  

             PAIGE
      You better be fucking with me.

The Kid smirks - nope.

             PAIGE
	(CONTD)
      How is Susan OK with this?

             THE KID
      We're on a break. 

             PAIGE
      What?  A break?  You gave her a 
      promise ring, Adam. 

             THE KID
      It is what it is. 

             PAIGE
        (overwhelmed)
      Mom and Dad will freak.  

             THE KID
      Fuck Mom and Dad.  They hate 
      everything I do anyway.  I'm gonna 
      pay rent now - you should be happy.  

Paige gives up.  

             THE KID
	(CONTD)
      Fifty bucks says something comes up 
      again and he doesnt show tonight.

             PAIGE
      Shut up.   

             THE KID
      Just saying.  When you get lonely 
      feel free to stop by-- Club 
      Xquisite down on Dale Maybre, doors 
      open at eight.  

             PAIGE
      Not in a million fuckin years.  

The Kid gets up, does a little stripper dance.  

             PAIGE
	(CONTD)
      Oh my God, gross!!

Paige walks out, slams the door.


INT. DRESSING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT 
All the strippers dress backstage, talk shop.

                                      42.

             KEN
      Its all about apps right now - 
      the market is hot on an exponential 
      level.  Ive been sayin to Dallas 
      forever - we gotta get an app.  
      Ive figured out the codes and 
      stuff but I aint gonna do it for 
      free, you know? 

             TITO
      You know what I wish there was -- 
      an app where you could see all the 
      routines other dancers use, with 
      all the props, songs, moves...  
      Right now theres just like no way 
      to know what else is out there.  

             KEN
      Id go 75/25 with you on it since I 
      know the codes.  Think about it.  

             TITO
        (to Mike)
      Hows the mobile detailing going -  
      you in the green?

             MIKE
      Im seeing solid returns. 

TOBIAS walks through shaking a small BOTTLE of pills.

             TOBIAS
      Gotta get that love potion!  

One by one the strippers grab pills, hand Tobias $10.  Mike 
takes one, washes it down with a beer, gives Tobias a $20.  
Tobias hands the Kid a pill.   

             TOBIAS
	(CONTD)
      Enjoy, Kid - thats pure.  

The KID swallows the pill.  Dallas voice booms over the P.A.

             DALLAS
	(O.S.)
      Alright alright, ladies...


                                      43.
INT. STAGE - MOMENTS LATER

Another show begins.  The strippers hit the stage.  One by 
one their routines ZOOM BY -- 

- WHOLE LOTTA ROSIE by AC/DC blasts.  BIG DICK RICHIE picks 
a FAT GIRL up over his head, buries her crotch in his face.

- KEN does a Hot For Teacher routine, brings a random girl 
on stage to play the student, spanks her.  

- TARZAN does his Tarzan routine, wildly swinging on a rope 
out through the audience.

THE KID goes out to the virgin routine - the girls go crazy.  
He grinds on an OLD WOMAN in the meat seats.

             OLD WOMAN
      You remind me of my nephew!    

On the Kid - lost in the moment, hundreds of screaming girls 
all crowing at him, waving money.  Its INSANE--

As the Kid dances PAIGE walks into the club - her face 
clearly indicating that indeed she got stood up.  She looks 
up at the stage and CANT BELIEVE HER EYES--  

Mike looks out from backstage, spots Paige.  

             MIKE 
        (to self)
      No shit.  

He throws on a jacket, walks through the crowd and up to her.

INT. XQUISITE - CONTINUOUS

             MIKE
      Somehow I didnt take you for one 
      of these girls but-- guess you just 
      never know.  

Paige turns, sees Mike.  

             PAIGE
      Wow.  You know Ive met a few 
      entrepreneurs in my life, but you 
      really take the cake.

             MIKE
      You should see me jump out of one.


                                      44.
             PAIGE
      Funny.  

They look out at the Kid dancing.

             MIKE
      So you come to see baby bro shake 
      it? 

             PAIGE
      Nope.  I came because I still held 
      out a sliver of hope that this was 
      all a big joke.    

Women stuff dollar bills down the Kids thong as he dances.  

             MIKE
      Looks pretty funny to me.

             PAIGE
        (serious)
      You better look after him.  

             MIKE
      Look after him?  Or what?

             PAIGE
      Or Ill kick your goddamn ass, is 
      what.  Mike.

             MIKE
      Id let you kick my ass any day.
        (off her look)
      Kidding!  Ease up, I promise. 

The music ends.  The Kid picks up dollar bills.  

             DALLAS
        (over P.A.)
      Alright put your hands together and 
      show some love for The Virgin, 
      ladies.  Now, it's time for a 
      little two-for-one to make-you-cum!  
      Please welcome to that center 
      stage, the Houdini of the dance 
      floor.  Our featured performer - 
      Mister Magic Mike! 

Paige looks at Mike - 'Magic Mike?  Are you serious?' 

             MIKE
      Thats my cue.  

Mike shrugs, heads for the stage, starts into his routine.  


Paige goes to leave.  On the way she turns, takes in a few moments of Mikes act - she cant help but enjoy it.

                                      45.

She walks out.  

INT. THE VILLAGE INN - LATER

The strippers eat at a late-night diner.  They pour drinks 
from bottles under the table - the waitresses dont care.   

             KEN
      Hey Kid - check it out.  
        (puts his index finger up 
         to the Kids nose)
      This ones the Mexican chick in the 
      front row.  
        (now his middle finger)
      This the bachelorette.

             THE KID
      Sick!  I prolly just got nose 
      crabs.

All the strippers laugh.  Big Dick Richie strains his back 
when he laughs.  

             BIG DICK RICHIE
      I think I got another hernia from 
      picking that fat chick up, man.

             MIKE
      Sucks, bro.  

             TITO
      We told you to stop with that shit, 
      man.  What is that - four now?  

             BIG DICK RICHIE
      Its my signature move.  

             MIKE
      What can you do - big girls need 
      love too.  

 Dallas comes over, counting stacks of CASH.

             TOBIAS
      Howd we come out?  

             DALLAS
      Best weekend this summer, boys.  
      Everybody gets a little bonus.  


He passes out money to the guys, hands the Kid $400. 
                                      46.

             DALLAS
	(CONTD)
      I gotta say, Kid - you can jam.  
      Maybe Ill make a performer out of 
      you yet.  
        (to the group)
      And as always, our number one 
      stunner, clocking in at five 
      hundred twenty bones - Magic Mike.

The strippers CLAP as Dallas hands Mike a fat stack of CASH.  

A group of FEMALE STRIPPERS walk into the restaurant with 
some guys.  One of them is AMBER.     

             DALLAS
	(CONTD)
      Well boys, its officially Monday.
        (they BOOO...)
      Im gonna throw some new stuff into 
      the mix for next weekend, so make 
      sure you come to practice ready to 
      rock. 

Dallas walks off towards the girls, strikes up a conversation 
with one.  Mike and Amber meet eyes - shes with a GUY.   

             THE KID
      Whore they?

             MIKE
      Ladies of Mons Venus.  Future 
      doctors and lawyers of America. 

The Kid laughs, focuses on a dark-haired, pierced stripper - 
ZORA, 26, man-eater.  Mike notices.

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      Thats Zora.  Shes a whole 
      different brand of crazy, Kid.  

The Kid takes a big pull of whiskey.

             TOBIAS
      Hope you dont have to get up 
      early.

             THE KID
      Got work at seven thirty.  

             TOBIAS
      Ouch.  Where?


                                      47.
             THE KID
      Dillards.  The perfume counter.  

Mike and Tobias laugh.

             THE KID
	(CONTD)
      I know - Im fuckin quitting.  

             TOBIAS
      No man - its genius.  You know how 
      much tail you could bring to the 
      club with that job? 

             MIKE
      Hes right.  Always look on the 
      bright side.  This is the land of 
      opportunity, you know.  

Mike takes the whiskey, pours a few glasses.

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      To great friends and beautiful 
      futures.

The Kid smiles - they cheers and slam their shots.

TITLE CARD: JULY

INT. BANK OF AMERICA - DAY

MIKE - coiffed, dressed in a suit - sits down in front of a 
FEMALE BANKER.  

             MIKE
      Youre Jennifer?
        (she nods)
      Mr. Rodriguez told me to come talk 
      to you about the status of my SBA 
      application.  

             BANKER
      Of course, sir.  Name and social?

             MIKE
      Michael Martingano.  330-72-7447.   

He lays out his ID.  She checks it - they meet eyes.  She 
smiles, looks at her computer.  

             BANKER
      It says your tax return analysis is 
      still incomplete.  If you just--

             MIKE
      As I told Mr. Rodriguez last week, 
      the businesses I manage deal 
      exclusively in cash, so the returns 
      wouldnt paint an accurate portrait 
      of my income.  


                                      50.
             MIKE
	(CONT'D)
      He told me to just forego that 
      section.  Should be noted there.

             BANKER
        (nope)
      Of course.  And youre currently a 
      manager of an automotive 
      accessories business?

             MIKE
      And an event management company, a 
      home design firm - list goes on.    

             BANKER
        (not)
      Impressive.    

             MIKE
      So what kind of rates am I looking 
      at?  

             BANKER
      Well, let me just check with Mr. 
      Rodriguez about the returns and--

             MIKE
      I thought today was his day off. 

             BANKER
      It is.  If you come back tomorrow-- 

             MIKE
      Thursdays my only free day and he 
      said you were the lady to talk to 
      on Thursdays.  I need to get this 
      processed or unfortunately Ive got 
      to consider another bank. 

             BANKER
      Certainly.  

She takes a moment, looks back at her computer.  

             BANKER
	(CONTD)
      There also seems to be a...credit 
      issue with your mortgage account, 
      sir.  Could be late payments--

             MIKE
      No, I dont think so--


                                      51.
             BANKER
      There are ways, of course, to clear 
      that up over time but we have a 
      policy that--

             MIKE
      Youre just punching buttons on 
      your computer and you think you 
      know something about me?   

             BANKER
      I-- no.  Of course not, but its 
      company policy.  We cant issue 
      loans to customers who score below 
      credit thresholds.

             MIKE
      Listen, Im just looking for a 
      reasonable deal here.

             BANKER
      There are programs, sir, that we 
      offer to qualified distressed 
      clients--

             MIKE
        (getting up)
      Distressed?  I read the paper - 
      yall are the only thing thats 
      distressed.  Tell Mr. Rodriguez Im 
      taking my business to Wells Fargo.  

             BANKER
      Im very sorry, sir.

             MIKE
        (fuck you)
      No problem at all.  

             BANKER
      Happy Fourth.  

Mike leaves, quiet rage burning through him.

INT. MIKES TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

Mike exits the bank, walks to his truck, climbs in--

He sits behind the wheel a moment, takes a breath, then-- 

VIOLENTLY PUNCHES the steering wheel.  WHAM.  WHAM.  WHAM.  


                                      52.
INT. PAIGES APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING

KNOCK.  KNOCK.  KNOCK.  A BANGING on the door.  No one 
answers.  More BANGING....  

Lights turns on - PAIGE comes out in her pajamas, opens up -

MIKE stands there in a cheap Marilyn Monroe COSTUME, with a 
red-white-and-blue TOP HAT, blowing a KAZOO.

             MIKE
      Happy birthday, America!

             PAIGE
      What are you doing here?  

             MIKE
      Sandbar party!  Lets go, lets go-- 

             PAIGE
      Its seven in the morning.    

             MIKE
        (imitating her)
      Its seven in the morning - I hate 
      fun.  Wheres the Kid?

             PAIGE
      Hes sleeping.   

Mike walks back to the living room - the Kid sleeps on the 
couch.  He blows the kazoo, tosses one to the Kid.  

             MIKE
      Wake up, Kid.

The Kid wakes up, laughs when he sees Mike.

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
        (to Paige)
      Youre coming too - lets go.  

             PAIGE
      I think not.  Its my day off, and 
      hes got work.

             MIKE
      Dont worry - I already called in 
      sick for him.  
        (to the Kid)
      Your boss, Jerry, seems very nice.  
      He offered to come drop off some 
      chicken soup.  


                                      53.
             MIKE
	(CONT'D)
      I told him hed be the first one 
      youd call in case you needed a 
      dick hickey. 

             THE KID
        (laughing)
      You asshole - thats my last sick 
      day! 

             MIKE
        (to Paige)
      How bout you?  Lets make your sick 
      call - what should we say?  Swine 
      flu, bird flu, painful urination--   
        (off Paiges look)
      --cramps? 

             PAIGE
      Im going back to bed.

She turns to walk away.  

             MIKE
      I hope youve got epic plans if 
      youre gonna turn your back on the 
      sandbar.

             THE KID
      Oh she does.  Theres a whole 
      twenty-four hours for her to argue 
      on the phone with Paul.  

Paige turns, annoyed.  On Mike - Paul?

             PAIGE
      Thats not true - Ive got plans. 

             THE KID
      Oh really?  With who?

On Paige - she knows the Kids got her pegged.  She looks at 
Mike, he grins.

EXT. SANDBAR, GULF OF MEXICO - DAY

             MIKE
	(O.S.)
      Bombs away!

A KEG splashes down into the water as a POWERBOAT engine 
idles.  We pull out to reveal MIKE, PAIGE, THE KID, and 
TOBIAS descending from a boat into-- 


                                      54.
A MASSIVE party in the middle of the ocean.  A handful of 
boats surround party-goers on a sandbar.  Girls - some 
TOPLESS - wade in the water, toss beach-balls, lounge in 
rafts, drink from half-sunken kegs.  ROMAN CANDLES blast.  

The Kid takes it all in - paradise.

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      What did I tell you?   

             PAIGE
      Marooned on an island with all the 
      strippers and meatheads in Tampa.  
      How did I get so lucky?

             MIKE
      I ask myself that same question 
      every day.

A PARTYGIRL comes up with a bottle of TEQUILA.

             PARTYGIRL
      Arrival shots!

Mike opens his mouth and she pours.  The Kid does the same.  
Paige waves her hand - no shots for me.  

             MIKE
      Uh oh - we got a party pooper on 
      our hands.

Mike and Paige meet eyes a moment.  Then, Paige opens her 
mouth, takes an extra long shot.  Mike claps.

      		THE KID
	There she is!

		MIKE
	Whoa! 


Paige finishes, grimaces as she swallows, cracks a grin.

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      So thats what the Kid meant when 
      he said you liked breakfast.  

Paige laughs.

             DALLAS
	(O.S.)
      There they are!  

DALLAS emerges from the crowd.  He bro-hugs Mike and the Kid.  

             THE KID
      Dallas, this is my sister, Paige.  


                                      55.
             DALLAS
        (putting on the charm)
      Hello, sweetheart.

             PAIGE
      Its Paige.

             DALLAS
        (awkward)
      Right.  Boysre over here.

Dallas leads them through the crowd to the group - TITO, BIG 
DICK CHARLIE, KEN and his stripper-ish WIFE, and a handful of 
other partiers greet them with BEERS.

             THE KID
        (to Paige)
      Oh Im so happy you came!

The Kid hugs Paige, lifts her up.  She shreiks, tries to 
break free as he drags her down into the water.  

             PAIGE
      No!  You punk!

He drags her under.  A few moments go by and she emerges from 
the water with the kid in a FULL-NELSON.  

             MIKE
      One.  Two.  Three.  Hes out!

She lets go and Mike raises her hand in the air.  She smiles.  

                                   LATER:

The group lounges in chairs, talks.  

             PAIGE
      So youre saying you dont believe 
      in school at all?

             DALLAS
      Fuck school.  Id just have Mad 
      Money on TV all day.  Teach my kid 
      everything about stocks, put him on 
      Ameritrade and all that shit.  He 
      wouldnt even need college - by the 
      time he was eighteen hed be flush.

             TOBIAS
      I dont know why everyone doesnt 
      do that.  Think of it purely from 
      an investment standpoint--


                                      56.
             DALLAS
      Thats the country we live in, man.  
      People are just stupid, you know?  

             PAIGE
      Please let me be a fly on the wall 
      when you have kids.

             DALLAS
      No problem.  You can stay in one of 
      our three pool-houses.    

Mike laughs.  Paige rolls her eyes, gets up, walks out alone 
down the sandbar.

             DALLAS
	(CONTD)
      Your sis got a little of the bitch 
      in her, huh?

             THE KID
      Nah, shes just mad stubborn.  

             TOBIAS
      Does she dominate her dude? 

             THE KID
      No - hes an even bigger asshole 
      than her.  Dont know why she stays 
      with him.

Mike processes that.

             TOBIAS
      You ask me, somebody aint hittin 
      that right.  

             THE KID
        (gross)
      Alright, enough!

Some nearby GIRLS call at the Kid.

             THE KID
	(CONTD)
      Thats my cue.

The Kid walks off.  Dallas looks at Mike.

             DALLAS
      Ill tell you, man, I consider 
      myself a good talent scout, but I 
      gotta hand it to you - you found us 
      a little diamond in the rough.  

Mike looks out at Paige, wading into the water.


                                      57.
MOMENTS LATER:

             MIKE
      Yeah.

Mike walks up to Paige in the water.

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      Need a refill?

She turns. 

             PAIGE
      Im good.  

             MIKE
      Having fun?

             PAIGE
      Not really my scene, but-- its 
      nice out here.

             MIKE
      See, Im not all bad.

             PAIGE
      Lets not go too far.  

Mike smiles.

             PAIGE
	(CONTD)
      I hear youre a pretty talented 
      builder.

             MIKE
      Yeah?  Whered you hear that?

             PAIGE
      A little birdie.

             MIKE
      A little birdie wearing a thong?

             PAIGE
      Yeah, I think so.

             MIKE
      Im opening up my own shop.  Just 
      waiting for the markets to hit the 
      sweet spot.  

             PAIGE
      Right.  I always wanted to be an 
      interior designer.


                                      58.
             MIKE
      What happened?

             PAIGE
      I dont know - something always 
      came up.  Schools expensive.  Then 
      the glitz and glam of the medical 
      assistant world came calling.    

             MIKE
      So you just gave up?  

             PAIGE
      No.  I needed to be able to support 
      myself.  You know - mortgage, heath 
      care, 401k--  

             MIKE
      Jesus.  See thats your issue - 
      just hearing that stuff makes me 
      want to kill myself.  When you run 
      your own business you dont gotta 
      deal with that shit.

             PAIGE
      The wise words of the stripper. 

             MIKE
      Im not a stripper.  

             PAIGE
      Entrepreneur.  Sorry.

Paige looks back to the party, sees the Kid making out with a 
STRIPPERISH GIRL.  She sighs. 

             MIKE
      Relax.

             PAIGE
      Whats that supposed to mean?  

             MIKE
      Trying to control him is like 
      trying to control the weather. Hes 
      young, hes gotta sew his oats.

             PAIGE
      Oh hes sewing his oats.
        (Mike laughs)
      Its easy for you to say, hes not 
      your family.  


                                      59.
             MIKE
      And you were never a nineteen-year- 
      old guy.  Just ease up. 

             PAIGE
      Id love to. But I cant.

             MIKE
      You think he could do better.

             PAIGE
        (is he offended?)
      Yeah.  So?

             MIKE
      So maybe youre an elitist.  Maybe 
      you dont like to have any fun.  

             PAIGE
      Wouldnt you like to know if thats 
      the truth?  

             MIKE
      I would, actually.  
        (she rolls her eyes)
      Listen, dont worry.  Im looking 
      out for him, OK?

She looks at Mike - OK.

             RANDOM PARTYER
	(O.S.)
      We got a floater!  

One of the kegs floats up to the surface - the crowd gives a 
collective AWWWW--

             MIKE
      Thats all she wrote.

A FIREWORK shoots up into the sky and EXPLODES.  

                                  CUT TO:

Red-white-and-blue LIGHTS shoot through the black.  COME SAIL 
AWAY by Styx blasts.

             DALLAS
	(O.S.)
        (into P.A.)
      Alright you lovely ladies - its 
      time to say Happy Birthday to Uncle 
      Sam and his six big, strong, 
      brothers.  


                                      60.
             DALLAS
	(O.S.)
	(CONT'D)
      I see you all rockin that red-
      white-and-blue, but greens the 
      only color that matters in here.  
      So open up those purses and say 
      hello to the cock-rocking Kings of 
      Tampa!

INT. XQUISITE - NIGHT

The strippers come out in SAILOR uniforms and begin a 
choreographed routine.  The crowd goes wild and DOLLAR BILLS  
rain down on the dancers.   

Routines race by --

- Tito does a SALSA routine to Mambo Number Five.

- The Kid does his new Camp Grenada routine.  Hello Muddah, 
Hello Fadah -- the crowd LAUGHS but eats it up.  

- Mike does a routine to Addicted to Love.  He dances up to 
a group of girls on a bachelorette party.  

Mike gives the BACHELORETTE - NICOLE, 40s, attractive, 
professional - a LAPDANCE--  

She enjoys every second, runs her hands over his stomach, his 
shoulders, they meet eyes--

The routine ends and Nicole tucks a HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL in 
Mikes g-string.

INT. BACKSTAGE - MOMENTS LATER

Mike collects all his dollar bills together, stuffs them into 
a TUBE SOCK, exploding with cash.  He unfolds the $100 - 
inside is a BUSINESS CARD.  

NICOLE MILLER, Esq. Winston & Strawn, LLP.  

Theres a hand-written phone number on the back.

EXT. TRIP PARK - NIGHT

Mike, Tobias, and The Kid sit in a concrete park, get high - 
they watch as FIREWORKS light up the night sky over the bay.  

             THE KID
      That Camp Grenada shit is lame, 
      man.  Its faggy.


                                      61.
             MIKE
      So change it up then.  

             THE KID
      Richie said its a classic - kills 
      it every time.

             MIKE
      Right.  So basically youre gonna 
      keep taking professional advice 
      from a guy named Big Dick Richie.  

Mike and Tobias laugh.

             TOBIAS
      Stay with us, Kid.  

             MIKE
      Just put your own spin on it. If 
      you did Camp Grenada like this--

Mike imitates the Kid doing Camp Grenada, throws some SLICK 
dance moves in--

             THE KID
      Damn!

             TOBIAS
      Throw your own shit in there, Kid.  
      I can toss in some effects, some 
      delay, maybe.  Get creative.  

             THE KID
      What about a NASA routine?  I get 
      like a spacesuit on, we play Pink 
      Floyd and shit.  Could be cool--

             MIKE
      On second thought maybe stay with 
      Camp Grenada.

They all laugh. 

             TOBIAS
      Chicks hate science and shit, dude - 
      never works.

Mike looks up at the night sky. 

             MIKE
      Okay. Forget about work and girls 
      and shit for a minute and let me 
      ask yall a serious question.  
      Yall believe in aliens?


                                      62.
             TOBIAS
      Like what - martians and shit?

             MIKE
      Yeah, like whatever.  

             THE KID
      Look at all the stars, man - course 
      somethings out there.  Like, the 
      odds say there has to be.

             MIKE
      Therere more stars than grains of 
      sand on all the beaches in the 
      world.  Heard that on CNN.

             THE KID
      Damn.  Thats fucked up.  

             TOBIAS
      I dont think its martians.  I 
      think its other yous and mes.  
      Thats the dimension you get sucked 
      into inside a black hole, man.  
      Theres no time, everything exists 
      in multiple realities. And then the 
      shit gets so dense that it like, 
      explodes again. 

             MIKE
      Implodes, dumbass.

             TOBIAS
      Right.

             THE KID
      Thats not what a black hole is.

             TOBIAS
      Oh?  When was the last time you 
      went to a black hole?  

             MIKE
      I think its all a game.  Like 
      somebodys just teasing us saying 
      look at all that stuff out there.  
      But were just all alone.  

             THE KID
      Fuck that - something is out there, 
      and I bet it knows were here.  
      Gimme another hit.

Mike watches as the Kid takes another hit - hes fucked up.  


                                      63.
             THE KID
	(CONTD)
      Where we goin tonight?  Whos 
      spinning at the Amp?

             MIKE
      Relax, killer.  Its only Friday - 
      we got time.  

INT. PAIGES APARTMENT - NIGHT

The Kid leans on the door, smashed and tired.  Mike knocks.  
PAIGE opens up.  The Kid stumbles inside.  

             MIKE
      See - told you Id look after him.

             PAIGE
        (not expecting this)
      Thanks.

She goes to shut the door - Mike sees a GUY, Paul, inside.  
Doesnt look like a happy environment.  

             MIKE
      Have fun.  

             PAIGE
      You too.

Mike goes to leave.

             PAIGE
	(CONTD)
      Thanks for bringing him home.

Mike nods, walks off.

                                 FADE TO:

INT. MIKES BEACH CONDO - NIGHT

Mike walks in - it's dark, lonely.

He goes to the fridge, cracks a beer, sits on the couch--

He pulls out a wad of DOLLAR BILLS from the night, starts 
straightening out each one on the table--  

He reaches the $100 bill.  NICOLE'S BUSINESS CARD falls out.

Mike looks at it a moment, then takes out his cell, dials--


INT. NICOLES HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
A PHONE RINGS.  The lights go on, revealing an elegant room.

NICOLE wakes up next to her FIANCEE in bed, answers--  

                                      64.

             NICOLE
      Hello?

             NICOLES FIANCEE
      Its two AM - who is that? 

INTERCUT WITH INT. MIKES CONDO

             MIKE
      Hey - its Mike.

             NICOLE
      Who?

             MIKE
      Mike - from the club.  You gave me 
      your card.

             NICOLE
      Tom, jesus.  Its two in the 
      morning-- 

             MIKE
      Sorry - nevermind.

             NICOLE
        (sighs)
      Just walk me through it again.

             MIKE
      Excuse me?

             NICOLE
        (to her fiancee)
      They need me to take a statement.
        (into the phone)
      Wheres the client right now?

             MIKE
      Um...

             NICOLE
      His street address, Tom. Where the 
      client is right now.

             MIKE
      Oh-- 1346 Jupiter Road.  


                                      65.
Nicole gets out of bed.

             NICOLE
      Ill be there - just dont waste my 
      fucking time, OK? 

She hangs up, kisses her fiancee.  

             NICOLE
	(CONTD)
      Idiot.

             NICOLES FIANCEE
      I dont know why you stay with this 
      firm.

             NICOLE
      I know.  See you later.  

She walks out the door.

INT. PAIGES APARTMENT - NIGHT

Paige gets out of bed, goes to the kitchen, sees THE KID up, 
drinking alone.  She sits down, has a drink with him. 

             PAIGE
      Sure you wanna keep hitting that?

He has another drink.  

             PAIGE
	(CONTD)
      Listen, brother bear - if you dont 
      get your act together Im gonna 
      have to kick your ass out of here.  

             THE KID
      I know.

             PAIGE
      We gotta have rules.  Like no 
      coming home trashed and unannounced 
      when Im on a date.  

             THE KID
      Didnt look like much of a date.

Beat.

             PAIGE
      It wasnt.

             THE KID
      See, look at all I do for you.


                                      66.
She smiles.

             THE KID
	(CONTD)
      You know maybe it would do you good 
      to just get with some random guy.  
      Loosen up, look on the bright side - 
      theres a lotta opportunity out 
      there.  

This lands on Paige.  She takes a moment.  

             PAIGE
      Well see.    
        (beat)
      For real, though--  If you bring 
      any stripper trash back here I will 
      whop her ass so good youll have to 
      sew her back together in the 
      morning.  You hear me?   

             THE KID
      I know you will.  Thats why I love 
      you.

INT. MIKES BEACH CONDO - NIGHT

NICOLE knocks on the door.  Mike answers it.   

             MIKE
      Hi.

             NICOLE
        (walking past him)
      Hi.

She looks around the apartment.  An awkward silence.

             NICOLE
	(CONTD)
      Nice place.

             MIKE
      You want a drink?

She nods.  Mike goes to the fridge, pours a vodka.  He brings 
it to her.  As she takes it he leans in to kiss her-- but she 
roughly PUSHES him back--

On Mike - that was unexpected.  

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      Im sorry, I thought--

He goes to her, but she PUSHES him back even harder.


                                      67.
             NICOLE
      Shut up.  

Mike looks at her a moment, then--  

She pushes him back AGAIN, but just stands there, daring him 
to come forward.

He moves forward, she tries to push him back, but he gets his 
arms inside hers, GRABS her, slams her up against the wall, 
KISSES HER, biting her lip. She isnt kissing him--shes 
devouring him.

             MIKE
      Is that a yes?

On Nicole.  She smirks-- YES.

A HEADBOARD BANGS in the darkness--

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      Oh yeah.  Oh god.

             NICOLE
      Fuck me.  Keep fucking me!   

MOMENTS LATER:

MIKE and NICOLE fuck wildly--  

UNCHAINED MELODY by the Righteous Brothers begins to play--

                                 FADE TO:

A spinning wheel of CLAY.  We slowly zoom out--

INT. XQUISITE - NIGHT

Time, goes by... So slowly...

A dark haired WOMAN molds clay on a spinning wheel on stage.

MIKE comes out from backstage, slowly dances up behind her, 
takes off his shirt--  SCREAMS from the audience.  

Mike slowly dances with the girl - its the GHOST ROUTINE.  
The clay on the wheel is in the mold of a LARGE PENIS.  The 
crowd goes crazy as-- 

The song kicks into a RE-MIXED DANCE BEAT.  The lights turn 
off and Mike begins giving the woman an AGGRESSIVE LAP DANCE.

                                  CUT TO:


                                      68.
More STRIPPING SEQUENCES fly by--

The Kid does Camp Grenada but puts some new moves into it - 
its getting pretty good.

Mike does his MY WAY routine--

The Kid goes out into the audience, gets MOBBED BY WOMEN.

Mike grinds seductively on a girl in the hot seats.  She runs 
her hands all over his body.  

Girls MAKE IT RAIN everywhere.  

Dallas comes backstage with WADS OF CASH, BEAMING--  

TITLE CARD: AUGUST

INT. DALLAS HOUSE, HURRICANE PARTY - AFTERNOON

A raging party at Dallas house - all the strippers are 
there, as are the Mons Venus girls and a handful of other 
shady party-goers.  RAIN POURS outside as everyone dances.  
ZORA, bikini-clad, dances on a table - the entertainment.

The Kid hangs with Tobias.  Tobias eats a pill.  

             TOBIAS
      If you want Id go halfsies with 
      you on a front, like I do with 
      Mike.  If we did a pack we could 
      make it really worth our while.  

             THE KID
        (what does that mean?)
      Yeah man, definitely.  

We pan over to MIKE, who stands with AMBER, surveying all the 
GIRLS in the crowd.

             AMBER
      Iny-miny-miny-mo, catch-a-tiger-by-
      the-tow -- whos it gonna be?

Mike looks around - no sign of the Kid, or Zora.  

             MIKE
      I dunno - who do you think?  

             AMBER
      I want a red head--
        (scanning)
      There.


                                      69.
She points out a cute looking REDHEAD.

             MIKE
      Good choice.  

             DALLAS
	(O.S.)
        (yelling)
      Alright everyone - settle down!  

Mike looks over at Dallas.  Big Dick Richie stands on Dallas 
sofa to quiet people down.  

             DALLAS
	(CONTD)
      Richie - thats fuckin micro-suede, 
      dude.  
        (Richie steps off)
      Thank you.   

Dallas slips off his shoes, stands on his sofa.    

             DALLAS
	(CONTD)
      Come on, quiet - I have an 
      announcement.  That means you too, 
      Tarzan - out of the shadows and 
      into the light, buddy. 

TARZAN lifts himself off a chair in the corner of the room.  
The crowd quiets.     

             DALLAS
	(CONTD)
      I told yall that this was a 
      special night, now Im gonna tell 
      you why.  As yall know, despite 
      the hurricane that has soiled our 
      otherwise bountiful Saturday, the 
      good Lord has blessed the Kings of 
      Tampa this summer.

Hoots and hollers from the audience.

             DALLAS
	(CONTD)
      And weve been talking for a long 
      time now about the market, when it 
      would hit the sweet spot, when we 
      could make a move and take this 
      thing global.  And Im here to tell 
      yall that that sweet spot is here.   

On Mike - whats he talking about?

             DALLAS
	(CONTD)
      As of September 1st, 2011, we will 
      no longer be the cock-rocking Kings 
      of Tampa.  


             DALLAS	(CONTD)
      Well be the cock  rockin kings of 
      four thousand square feet of pure 
      Miami beach real estate.  The big 
      time - how do yall like that?     

                                      70.

Cheers.  On THE KID, pure excitement.  He and Mike share a 
look. On Mike--

             DALLAS
	(CONTD)
      Magic Mike and the Kid here will 
      top-line for us, and were gonna-- 
        (looks at a note-card)
      simul-cast shows online all over 
      the world.  So heres to four more 
      weeks of Tampa - lets burn this 
      place down! 

The crowd toasts, erupts.  Dallas throws out a handful of 
FLYERS - the Kid and Mike stand shirtless in front of a 
cheesy superimposed background:  Club Menage, Miami.

The Kid goes to Mike.

             THE KID
      How crazy is this!  

They fist-bump.  

             MIKE
      Yeah man!  

             THE KID
      Were gonna fuckin kill it down 
      there.  

The Kid looks at ZORA through the crowd - she cradles a POT-
BELLY PIG.  She looks back at him seductively.  Mike sees. 

             MIKE
      Go get em, tiger. Just put a condom 
      on your brain.

Mike walks over to Dallas.

             DALLAS
      Hey, buddy.  Hows it feel to be 
      moving up in the world?

             MIKE
      Good.  Happening pretty fast, huh?

             DALLAS
      Making moves, baby.  If you aint 
      fast youre last - you know.  


                                      71.
             MIKE
      Yeah, I know.  Its just - I got my 
      condo, been looking around for 
      space for my business and all.  

             DALLAS
      Your business?  Come on, dog, we 
      been doing this for what now - six 
      years?  This is your business - the 
      moment weve been waiting for.  
      Take it in.   

             MIKE
      Yeah.  Just gotta sink in I guess.  

             DALLAS
      No doubt.  Remember, were in this 
      together, like we always said.  
      Seven point five across the board.    

             MIKE
      Wasnt it ten?

             DALLAS
      Well, yeah, but we gotta cut the 
      Kid in a bit.  Youll both be top-
      lining, hell bring in the teen 
      demographic so I was thinking like 
      two point five, but well all sit 
      down and work it out.  

Mike looks across the room - AMBER flirtatiously waves.  

             MIKE
      Yeah - well figure it out.  

             DALLAS
      Exactly.  Drink up.

Dallas raises his glass - they CHEERS and drink.  

Across the room, the Kid talks with ZORA.  Shes got one foot 
in this world, one somewhere else.  Her gaze is piercing.  

MOMENTS LATER:

             ZORA
      This is Herman.

Zora pets her PIG.  

             THE KID
      Hi, Herman.  Nice to meet you.  


The Kid pets Herman - it squeals.
                                      72.

             ZORA
      He likes you.

             THE KID
      Cool.
        (Im in)
      So - where you from?

             ZORA
      Right here.  

             THE KID
      Like Tampa?

             ZORA
      No.  Like here.

             THE KID
      Oh.  That must be nice.

             ZORA
      Sometimes.  

             THE KID
      Sometimes what?  

             ZORA
      Do you want some Molly?

             THE KID
        (Molly?)
      Definitely.

She grins - hes an amateur.  

             ZORA
      Come on.  

Zora leads the Kid back down a hallway in Dallas house.  
They open up a door to a bedroom, enter--

INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

They walk in, find KEN and his wife, whos TOPLESS.  Zora 
lets her pig onto the ground.  

             KEN
      Hey yall.

             THE KID
      Hey.


                                      73.
             ZORA
      Wed like to order, please. 

             KEN
      Angels or demons?

             ZORA
      Angels.

Ken pulls out two pills of MDMA, hands them over.

             KEN
      How you kids doing?  

             KENS WIFE
      This storm is crazy, huh?

Thunder claps outside.  Zora takes a pill, the Kid takes one.   

             THE KID
      Yeah - nuts.  

The Kid looks at Kens wifes TITS.  Ken catches him.

             KEN
      My wifes tits are awesome, right?

             THE KID
      Oh, yeah - sure.  

             KEN
      Check em out.  Go ahead - feel em.

             THE KID
      What?

             KEN
      Go ahead.

             KENS WIFE
      Theyre real, I swear.    

The Kid awkwardly reaches over, feels Kens wifes tits.

             KENS WIFE
	(CONTD)
      See?

             THE KID
      Pretty great.

             KEN
      Keep going.

Ken and the Kid meet eyes.  Kens wife touches the Kid.


                                      74.
             KENS WIFE
      You have such good energy.
        (to Zora)
      Come here, sweetheart.

Zora smiles, walks over, KISSES Kens wife, then MAKES OUT 
with the Kid.  Ken watches as they start to GO AT IT--

INT.  DALLAS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Amber walks up to Mike with the RED-HEAD.

             AMBER
      Hey, mister big shot, this is my 
      lovely new friend, Kate. 

             REDHEAD
        (dangerously innocent)
      Hi.

             AMBER
      Guess what I discovered she has--  
      shrooms.  Maybe we go somewhere 
      more private and enjoy them?

On Mike - not exactly where his heads at.  

             MIKE
      Sure.  Gimme one sec, Ill meet you 
      guys--

INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Mike walks into the bathroom, downs his drink in one gulp, 
looks in the mirror-- 

He looks out the window - the rain pours down.  He OPENS the 
window, wedges himself out, climbs onto the roof--

EXT. DALLAS ROOF - CONTINUOUS

Mike crawls onto the roof in the rain.  Thunder barks.

He lays down, lets the wind and rain wash over him.  

                                 FADE TO:


EXT. PAIGES APARTMENT - THE NEXT DAY
The Kid and Mike pull up outside in a BRAND NEW TRUCK, lifted 
up on big wheels.  The subwoofer BLASTS.  The Kid HONKS the 
horn a couple times.  Paige comes out-- 

                                      75.

             PAIGE
      Oh Jesus.

             THE KID
      Whatta think?

             PAIGE
      Its very-- you.

             THE KID
      Why thank you, sis.  

             PAIGE
      And to what pleasure do I owe this 
      visit?

             THE KID
      We thought you could help us 
      celebrate.

On Paige-- what does that even mean?

EXT. GO-KART RACING TRACK - DUSK

VROOOM!! Paige, Mike, and the Kid WHIP around a corner in a 
GO-KART race.  They bump each other, laugh.

They approach the finish line.  Mike drafts the Kid and pulls 
ahead, but Paige comes up from the outside--

Mike races forward, the finish approaching--  He looks over, 
sees Paige, hes in the clear--

But she suddenly SWERVES into him, sending him spinning out 
into the tires.  She races forward for the WIN.

MOMENTS LATER:

They climb out of the cars.  Paige laughs as Mike runs over.

      		MIKE
	That was so cold!

		THE KID
	You bitch!

Paige smiles - dont sleep on me.


                                      76.
             THE KID
      I want another shot at the title.  
      Lets go - I got both you guys.  

He pulls out a WAD of ONES from his pocket to pay.

             PAIGE
      Im going out on a high note.  Ill 
      be at the bar.

             MIKE
      Yeah, I think I got whiplash, dude.

             THE KID
      Awwww... OK, Im doing one more.  
      See yall up there.

INT. RACE-TRACK BAR - MOMENTS LATER

Paige and Mike have a drink.

             PAIGE
      So Miami sounds...crazy.

             MIKE
      Yeah, its gonna be.  

             PAIGE
      I dont like it.  But Im done 
      trying to make him listen.

             MIKE
      Whoa - did the Earth just shift?  
      Are you taking my advice for once?

             PAIGE
      As much as I hate to say it.
        (Mike smiles)
      Im sure yall will enjoy 
      yourselves.  Dont forget about me 
      and all your other normal friends.

             MIKE
      Oh come on now, youre not so 
      normal.

             PAIGE
      Oh no - hows that?

             MIKE
      Youre a little better than normal, 
      I guess.


                                      77.
             PAIGE
      A little better, huh?  Well thanks, 
      I guess.

             MIKE
      No problem.

Paige takes a drink.  Mike looks at her a beat.

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      Hey - what if you and me went out 
      sometime?  Like, to dinner or 
      something.

Paige turns to him.

             PAIGE
      What do you mean, like a date?

             MIKE
      No, I mean I dunno, you dont have 
      to call it that - just hang out.  

             PAIGE
        (back to reality)
      I dont just sport-fuck my 
      brothers stripper friends.

             MIKE
      Thats not what I meant.

             PAIGE
      No, I apologize.  Its just, I 
      dont think you and me are really-- 
      Id rather not if thats OK.    

On Mike - something just sank inside, but he plays it off.

             MIKE
      Relax.  I just thought we could 
      talk, be friends.

             PAIGE
      If you just want to talk, my door 
      is always open.  

THE KID walks up.

             THE KID
      You tryin to get with my sister 
      over there?


                                      78.
             MIKE
      Pshhh...  And what would you do 
      about it if I were?

             THE KID
      Not me.  Her.

Paige smiles.  

             THE KID
	(CONTD)
      Yo, you get Dallas text?
        (Mike shakes his head)
      We got a private tonight.  Some 
      sorority house.  

Paige puts her fingers in her ears.

             PAIGE
      Nananananana--

Mike playfully pulls her fingers out, she squeals.

             THE KID
        (in Paiges face)
      $750 bones to rub our nuts on some 
      college girls!

INT. SORORITY HOUSE - NIGHT

Mike and The Kid knock on the door.  A couple giggling COEDS 
let them in.  A room full of girls OGGLE them. 

             MIKE
      There a bathroom to change in?

One of the girls points.  Mike and the Kid head for it.  On 
the way they notice a group of FRAT-BOYS drinking out on a 
balcony.

                                   LATER:

Mike and the Kid, down to just THONGS, give LAP-DANCES to 
various young pledges while sorority sisters WILDLY CHEER.

The Kid seems to dig the girl he dances for.  Mike looks 
over, sees the Kid hand the girl a couple PILLS--

The Kid and Mike dance with the last of the pledges - the 
partys winding down.  The song switches.

                                   LATER:


             SORORITY GIRL      OK pledges - last song!

One of the FRAT-BOYS comes into the room, drunk, taps on the 
Kids shoulder.  Mike looks over. 

                                      79.

             FRAT BOY
      Hey - you give some ecstasy to my 
      chick?

             THE KID
      What?

             FRAT BOY
      I said-- did you give ecstasy to my 
      girl?

             THE KID
      No, man.  Sorry.

             FRAT BOY
      OK - cool.

The guy walks off.  A SONG starts.  The Kid begins to dance 
when--

SMACK!  The Kid is CLUBBED from behind with a BEER BOTTLE.  
It doesnt break.  He hits the floor--  

             FRAT BOY
	(CONTD)
      Fuckin faggot!

Girls SCREAM and run.  MIKE rushes over.  The Kid gets to his 
feet--

Mike squares off with the Frat-Boy, BLASTS him with a 
combination, puts him down--

             FRAT BOYS
	(O.S.)
      FAGGOTS!!

A pack of FRAT-BOYS streams into the room--

             MIKE
      Kid, lets go!

But the Kid goes straight at the Frat-Boys, picks up a CHAIR, 
throws it--  A MELEE ensues through the house--   

Mike rushes to his aid, gets CLOCKED by one of the Frat-Boys.  
A SORORITY GIRL jumps on the Frat-Boys back to stop him.  
Mike gets up and DRIVES THEM INTO A WALL-- 


                                      80.
The Kid connects with a few solid punches, takes a few--  
Mike fights his way to the Kid, GRABS him--

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      Come on!  

Mike pulls the Kid through a nearby window.

EXT. SORORITY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

They JUMP down off the roof as Frat-Boys give chase.  More 
come out the front door--

Mike and the Kid RUN across the lawn to the Kids truck.  
They reach the truck.

             MIKE
      The keys!

The Kid fumbles with his sock.  The frat boys close in--

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      Lets go, lets go!

The Kid pulls out the keys, unlocks the car.  They climb in, 
shut the doors JUST as the frat-boys reach them.

INT. THE KIDS TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

The Frat-Boys POUND on the truck, start prying open the doors-

Mike cranks the engine and hits the gas--

The car screeches forward--  But one Frat-Boy comes out of 
nowhere and JUMPS on the hood--

             FRAT BOY
      Faggots!!

Mike swerves wildly, driving through a palmetto patch and up 
onto the lawn.  The car doughnuts and the Frat-Boy whips off 
the hood--

Mike guns it across the lawn and back onto the road--  He 
turns a corner, checks the rearview -- clear.  

             MIKE
      What the FUCK!  


                                      81.
             THE KID
        (eye swelling)
      My fucking backpack, man!  I gotta 
      go back there and get it.

             MIKE
      Your backpack?  Are you fucking 
      kidding me?

On the Kid - something was important in that backpack.

             THE KID
      Fuck.  I dont even want to get out 
      and look at this fucking truck.

             MIKE
      Insurancell pay for it.  
        (beat)
      What the hell are you doing giving 
      pills to those chicks?  

             THE KID
      It was just a couple.

             MIKE
      It was more than a couple.  Whered 
      you get em?

             THE KID
      Tobias fronted em to me.  

             MIKE
      What?  How many?

             THE KID
        (thinks a moment)
      Just a few.  Its no big deal. 

             MIKE
      A few?  Be exact - fronting means 
      you gotta pay him back for every 
      last one you fuckin idiot.  

             THE KID
      Like ten, OK?  Ill pay him 
      tomorrow and well be square.  
      Chill out, Jesus.  

Mike eases up - they drive.

             THE KID
	(CONTD)
      Plus fuck worrying about money now 
      that were partners.   


                                      82.
             MIKE
      What?  

             THE KID
      What do you mean what?  The new 
      club-- you and me splittin the ten 
      percent--  Were gonna be flush!  

Mike looks at the Kid, processes the comment.

             MIKE
      Right.  

             THE KID
      We clocked a couple of em pretty 
      good, huh?

             MIKE
      Hell yeah we did.

They fist-pound.  

             THE KID
      I cant go home like this. I need a 
      drink - lets go to Ybor.  

EXT. TAMPA STREETS - MOMENTS LATER

Mike, the Kid, and Zora walk to the clubs.  On the way they 
pass by a NICE RESTAURANT.  Mike looks in the window-- 

He sees NICOLE and her FIANCEE inside eating.  He STARES for 
a moment.  Theyre dressed nice, looks expensive-- 

Mike calls out to the Kid and Zora.

             MIKE
      Yall go ahead, Ill meet you at 
      the club.

Mike walks into the restaurant.

INT. RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

Mike walks in all roughed up.  Nicole turns, sees him- uh oh.

They meet eyes.  Awkward.  Mike comes up to their table.

             MIKE
      I thought that was you.

                                      83.


             NICOLE      Hi.

        (to her husband)
      Ryan, this is Mike.

             MIKE
        (extends his hand)
      Nice to meet you.

Ryan looks at Mike - did this guy just break out of jail?

             RYAN
      Nice to meet you.

             MIKE
        (to Ryan)
      Im sure you know this, but your 
      wife is a killer.  She handled my 
      case like...it was amazing to 
      watch.

             RYAN
      She works hard.  Too hard, 
      sometimes.

             MIKE
      Well, dont let me interrupt.  I 
      just wanted to say thanks again.

             NICOLE
      Im glad youre happy.

             MIKE
      Bye.

             RYAN
      Bye.

Mike leaves.

             RYAN
	(CONTD)
      What case was that?

             NICOLE
      Multiple DUIs.  Violent offender. 
      Rich parents keep bailing him out. 
      Are we getting the flan?

INT. MIKES BEACH CONDO - LATER THAT NIGHT

NICOLE and MIKE lie in bed, post-coital.  She smokes a JOINT.


                                      84.
             NICOLE
      So you made this headboard?  

             MIKE
      Yeah.

             NICOLE
      Its beautiful.  You did an amazing 
      job with the space.  

             MIKE
      Thanks.  

Mike takes a hit.  She looks at him--

             NICOLE
      So do you enjoy stripping?  

             MIKE
      Yeah, its OK.  Good money, fun.  

             NICOLE
      Lots of pussy--

             MIKE
      Youre my first, actually.

Nicole laughs.

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      It feels good to provide a release 
      for women.  I like it.  

             NICOLE
      How do you mean?

             MIKE
      You know - fulfill their fantasies, 
      make em feel what theyre not 
      feelin in their regular life.  

This lands on Nicole, but she doesnt show it.  

             NICOLE
      Youre quite a public servant.

             MIKE
      Guess so.

             NICOLE
      So youre happy-- with your job?


                                      85.
             MIKE
      Its not my job.  I got a lot of 
      other shit going on.  Im opening 
      up my own design/build shop.  

             NICOLE
      Thats great.  

             MIKE
      What about you?  

             NICOLE
      My job?  Moneys good, but I work 
      all the time so its tough... 
      personally.  But I love it.    

Mike takes a puff.  

             MIKE
      Sometimes - right at the moment 
      when I start to take off my 
      clothes, thats when it feels a 
      little fucked-up, you know?

             NICOLE
      Huh?

             MIKE
      Just that moment is a little weird.  
      Like God is watching me.  Then its 
      gone.

             NICOLE
        (were going too deep)
      Yeah.  

             MIKE
      Relax!  Im just playing with you.

She laughs, lets out a nervous breath.  Was he serious?

INT. ZORAS APARTMENT - NIGHT

ZORA and THE KID FUCK on the bathroom floor, high out of 
their minds--  The Pig runs around, SQUEALS.

It's dark, wild sex.  The Kid is lost in the moment--

                                 FADE TO:


                                      86.
INT. MIKES BEACH CONDO - NEXT MORNING

A loud BANGING, followed by various SMASHES--

Mike and Nicole lay in bed.  More SMASHES--

Nicole wakes up.

             NICOLE
        (waking Mike)
      Hey.  Hey!

SMASH--  Mike wakes up. 

             MIKE
      What the fuck?

Mike RUNS out to the living room, SEES--

INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

TWO MASKED MEN, SMASHING things with BATS, rifling through 
his stuff--

             MIKE
      Hey!

They keep SMASHING--

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      Heeeyyy!!

They look and see him, stop.  NICOLE comes out, SCREAMS!

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      Get back in the bedroom!

She slams the door.  

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
        (screaming)
      What the FUCK are you doing?

             MASKED MAN
      Tobias said--

Mike holds his FINGER to his mouth-- Shhhhhh...

             MIKE
        (whispering)
      I said eight PM not eight AM you 
      idiots!


                                      87.
             MASKED MAN
      Fuck you.

             MIKE
        (ready to kill)
      Fuck me?

Mike looks and sees theyve SMASHED his homemade TABLE. 

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      You motherfuckers.  
        (SCREAMS)
      Ahhhhhhhh -- get the fuck out of 
      here!  Get out!

Mike motions to them to LEAVE.  They finally get the point, 
pretend to SCREAM and RUN OFF.  Mike sits down--

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
        (to Nicole)
      You can come out!

NICOLE opens the door, sees the destruction--

             NICOLE
      Oh.  My.  God.  What happened?

             MIKE
      They mustve been looking for my 
      safe.  

Mike goes to his WALL-SAFE, checks it.

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      I scared them off.

             NICOLE
      Who were they?

             MIKE
      Who knows.  Im calling the cops.

             NICOLE
      Yeah.  Let me--

             MIKE
      Dont worry, Ill wait till you 
      leave.  

             NICOLE
      This is terrible.  I hope youre 
      insured.


                                      88.
             MIKE
      I am.  

             NICOLE
      I wish I could help, I just cant 
      be a witness, you know. 

Mike looks at her - she wants nothing to do with him.  

             MIKE
      Whatever.  Dont worry about it.  

             NICOLE
      Right.  Well, if for some reason it 
      ends up in court just call me if 
      you need a favor with the judge.  

             MIKE
      Why would I need a favor?  

             NICOLE
      Because.  They look at everything 
      in court.  Its really so 
      subjective with these judges, 
      morally speaking at least.

             MIKE
      What do you mean?

             NICOLE
      Just that they judge everything 
      about you under a microscope, 
      thats all.  
        (awkward silence)
      Look, forget it.

Mike stares at her, cold.  He knows what she means--

             MIKE
      Do they judge you if youre a lying 
      whore who cheats on her husband?  
        (off her stare)
      Morally speaking, Im just curious.

             NICOLE
      Fuck you.  I was trying to help.

             MIKE
      No fuck you!  

Mike THROWS a PLATE from the floor at the wall.


                                      89.
             MIKE
	(CONTD)
        (exploding)
      You think you know me?  Get out of 
      here!  Get out!

She screams.  Mike grabs her, pulls her out the door, throws 
her clothes out after her, SLAMS the door.  

He takes a moment, then picks up the phone, dials 911.  

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
        (into phone)
      Yeah, I want to report a break-in.  

INT. XQUISITE DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

The strippers get dressed backstage.  Mike and the Kid sport 
shiners.

             THE KID
      I still cant believe that shit.  
      They smashed your fucking table?  I 
      mean - what for?

             MIKE
      Thats what I want to know, Kid.

Mike stares across the room at TOBIAS.  They lock eyes.

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      It was the ONE thing that really 
      mattered to me in there, and they 
      fuckin smashed it.

             THE KID
      I still say we find em, fuck em up.  

             MIKE
      Insurance is takin care of it.  

             TITO
      What do you get for a claim like 
      that?

             MIKE
      Well see.  It was a lot of damage, 
      but couldve been more if they came 
      when I wasnt there.

Again he locks eyes with Tobias.


                                      90.
             TOBIAS
      You probably shouldnt have come 
      out and chased em off.  For your 
      own safety, I mean.  You got lucky.  

             MIKE
      Lucky?  Theyre a bunch of fuckin 
      retards, lucky I didnt kill em.

             THE KID
      This is why these fuckin gun laws 
      piss me off.  Its first amendment, 
      so why cant we carry?

             TARZAN
      My second cousin was killed by a 
      firearm.

             MIKE
      OK - just chill out, its fine.  
      Just wish they wouldnt of smashed 
      the table.      

Dallas comes into the room, looks at the Kid and Mike. 

             DALLAS
      Look what the cat dragged in.  
        (off their looks)
      Yall got nothing to say?   

             MIKE
      It was fucked, man.  No point in 
      discussing it.  

             DALLAS
      And Im assuming you didnt collect-

             MIKE
      I forgot to ask em while they were 
      chasing us out the fuckin windows.  

             DALLAS
      This is the last thing I need for 
      my reputation right before we make 
      the big move.  

             MIKE
      Yeah, well you wouldnt be making 
      the big move without me and the 
      Kid so maybe you should chill out. 

             DALLAS
      Whatd you say, buddy? 


                                      91.
             MIKE
      I said chill out.   

Dallas goes to Mike, gets real close.

             DALLAS
      You better watch yourself, old 
      friend.  No one walks on water on 
      my team.  

             MIKE
      No one but you.  

Dallas processes the comment.  He leans in, lowers his voice.

             DALLAS
      Thinkin bout biting the hand that 
      feeds you, big dog?

Mike looks back at Dallas, says nothing.  

             DALLAS
	(CONTD)
      Thats what I thought.  We got our 
      blowout show next weekend.  You 
      better be there with bells on and 
      act like the professional I trained 
      you to be.  Well put this all 
      behind us in Miami.  

             MIKE
      Roger that.  

             DALLAS
        (gets up, to the room)
      OK boys, lets rock and rule!

INT. XQUISITE STAGE - MOMENTS LATER

The shows in full swing.  Lets Get Married by Jagged Edge--

      exchange some vows so get those 
      tissues out and please welcome up 
      to that center stage, Mister Magic 
      Mike!

Mike, dressed like a GROOM, goes out to a SCREAMING crowd, 
begins to dance up to girls in the crowd.  They eat it up--

Girl lets just married, I just wanna get married...


                                      92.
Mike takes his shirt off in front of a group of birthday 
girls.  We see that the birthday girl is SUSAN (the Kids ex-
girlfriend).  Susans embarrassed but her friends CHEER as 
Mike dances on her--

Mike moves to another group.  ON HIS FACE as he unbuckles his 
pants, takes them off.  Girls GROPE, stuff dollars at him--

Mike dances up to a girl in camo shorts whos MISSING AN ARM.  
He gives her an extra long lap dance.  She smiles.

MOMENTS LATER:

Mikes routine ends.  

             DALLAS

             THE KID
      That ones a winner, man.  

             MIKE

             DALLAS
        (over P.A.)
      ...stepping right up to that center 
      stage with his six shooter cocked 
      and ready to rock-- THE KID!


                                      93.
The Kid steps out on stage.  Im a cowboy...On a still horse 
I ride.  Im wanted...dead or alive.  

The lights go up and the Kid starts to dance.  On SUSAN as 
the Kid dances towards them.  She looks up---

Their EYES MEET--  HOLY SHIT.  The Kid freezes---

             DALLAS
	(CONTD)
      Alright birthday girls, you dont 
      just have to look - you can touch!

He starts back into his dance, goes up to the girls.  Susans 
AWESTRUCK as the Kid dances over them, right up to her--

The Kids routine ends.  He picks up dollar bills.  

MOMENTS LATER:

             DALLAS
	(CONTD)
        (over P.A.)
      Alright ladies, give it up for our 
      resident outlaw, the Kid!

The Kid walks off the stage.  On his way he turns, sees SUSAN 
get up, WIPE A TEAR away, walk off through the crowd.   

INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

The Kid walks backstage.  Mike sees somethings up.  

             MIKE
      You good?

             THE KID
      Yeah.  Lets get crazy tonight.  

             MIKE
      I dont know, man.  

             THE KID
      Come on, pussy.  Its Saturday - 
      lets do this!

The Kid swallows a couple PILLS with a swig of water, gives 
Mike a crazy face.

             MIKE
      Oh youre gonna challenge me, huh?
        (the Kid nods - its on!)
      Thats it - gimme some.    

Mike snaps into PARTY MODE.  


                                      94.
INT. AMPITHEATER CLUB - NIGHT

Bounce by Calvin Harris shakes the bass through a packed 
house.  Glo-boys dance on stage.  The crowd dances, sweats.  

MIKE, ZORA, AMBER, and THE KID wildly dance in the crowd.   

They all walk out of the club, high as hell.  

A COP CAR screams by.  On the Kid - the SIRENS reverberate 
over and over though his head.  He laughs-- 

                                   LATER:

INT. MIKES TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

They cross the bridge on the way to Mikes.  Zora holds her 
PIG in the backseat.  The Kid sees a HUGE CELL-PHONE TOWER at 
the far end of the bridge, overlooking the water.  

             THE KID
      How high is that?

             ZORA
      Like a hundred feet man.  

             THE KID
        (to Mike)
      Pull over.  

             MIKE
      Huh?

             THE KID
      Pull over - right there.  

Mike pulls over.

EXT. ROADSIDE - CONTINUOUS

The Kid gets out of the car, walks over to the cell tower, 
HOPS THE FENCE surrounding it--

             MIKE
      Fuck is he doing?

The Kid starts to CLIMB the side of the tower--

ZORA laughs as the Kid climbs higher up.

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      Shit. 


                                      95.
Mike hops the fence after him.

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      Kid!

The Kid looks down and laughs, climbs higher--

EXT. CELL PHONE TOWER - CONTINUOUS

The Kid makes his way towards a small LEDGE at the top.  He 
reaches for a hold, barely grabs it, pulls himself up--  

             THE KID
      Whooooooo!!!!

The Kid starts DANCING on the ledge, looks over the city.  

Zora blasts MUSIC from Mikes car, laughs as the Kid dances.

Mike climbs up after him, looks down -- holy shit its far.

The Kid does a HANDSTAND.  Zora holds up both her hands--

             ZORA
      Thats an eight, baby!

Mike gets to the ledge, grabs the hold, pulls himself up.

             THE KID
      Welcome to the top of the world!

             MIKE
      You crazy motherfucker.

Mike climbs up on the ledge and does a TWIRL.  The girls hold 
up their hands--

             AMBER
      Nine!

The Kid climbs onto a railing and starts to walk it like a 
TIGHTROPE-- 

             ZORA
      Wooooo -- Ten!  

On his feet, step after step, they wobble...then--

He SLIPS--

But Mike GRABS him at the last second, pulls him back to the 
ledge.


                                      96.
             THE KID
      Holy shit!!!

             MIKE
      Lets get the fuck outta here.

They look down - a big drop.  Mike lets out a nervous laugh. 

EXT. MIKES BEACH CONDO - THE NEXT DAY

Music plays loudly inside.  Through a window we see Mike 
SOUND ASLEEP in bed next to Amber--

A KNOCKING--  Mike still doesnt wake up.  

More KNOCKING--

PAIGEs face comes to the window.  She sees Mike in bed, 
knocks hard on the window.  

             PAIGE
      Hey!  Open up.

Mike finally opens his eyes, sees Paige.  He gets up, goes to 
the living room, opens the door.

             MIKE
        (over the music)
      Hey.  

             PAIGE
        (yelling)
      Have fun last night?

Mike goes to talk, realizes how loud the music is, turns it 
off, comes back to the door.

             MIKE
      Sorry.  Whats up?  

             PAIGE
      Is Adam here?  He left me a couple 
      weird voice mails last night.  He 
      sounded all fucked-up, now I cant 
      reach him.    

Mike takes a moment.  Paige looks down, sees the Kids SHOES.

             MIKE
      Oh - yeah.  Hes fine, hes in the 
      guest room.

Paige walks in past Mike.


INT. MIKES BEACH CONDO - CONTINUOUS
Paige looks around Mikes place - still trashed, scattered 
beer cans lie everywhere.

                                      97.

             PAIGE
      Wow.

             MIKE
      Vandals.  Smashed everything.

             PAIGE
      Nice floors.  

             MIKE
      Yeah - its cherry walnut.

They walk to the guest room.  A pigs GRUNT.  Mike looks at 
Paige, shrugs. 

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      Just knock in case--

But Paige just OPENS the door, sees--

THE KID, passed out face-down on the floor in a POOL OF 
VOMIT, a bloody SCRATCH on his back-

ZORA lies on the bed, her bra pulled up over her breasts--

             MIKE
	(CONTD)
      What the fuck--

The PIG squeals.  On PAIGE--

She RUNS to the Kid, flips him over.

             PAIGE
      Adam!  Adam...

She slaps his face a couple times -- nothing.

             PAIGE
	(CONTD)
      Whatd he take?

             MIKE
      I--  Ecstasy, maybe some G, I dont 
      know--

She lays him down, starts PUMPING on his chest--

             PAIGE
      Come on, come on--


Nothing.  On Mike - hes frozen, SHOCKED--  He bends down to help.

                                      98.

             MIKE
      Cmon, Kid!  

             PAIGE
      Get off!  God, please--

She puts her ear to his chest.

             PAIGE
	(CONTD)
      Hes barely breathing.
        (screaming)
      Come on, Adam!

Paige raises her hand, POUNDS down on his chest, then--

The Kid GASPS, spitting up vomit-- 

He coughs, looks up at Paige with bloodshot, glassy eyes.

She and the Kid meet eyes for a long moment.  Then, Paige 
looks at ZORA, RUNS over to the bed, JUMPS on her--

             PAIGE
	(CONTD)
      What the FUCK did you do to my 
      brother you fucking slut!!

Paige CHOKES Zora and starts PUNCHING HER IN THE FACE--  But 
Zoras still passed out like a wet noodle, she just groans.

Paige gets a few huge rights in, then Mike GRABS her--

She turns, PUNCHES MIKE in the face, knocking him backwards.  
She comes to hit him again, raises her hand, Mike FLINCHES--

             PAIGE
	(CONTD)
      Ill kill you!

He and Paige meet eyes.  Shes on fire.  

             MIKE
      Im sorry.  Im just trying to 
      HELP!

             PAIGE
      Youre sorry?  Oh, I apologize 
      then.  I didnt realize that all 
      this time you just wanted to help.  

             MIKE
      Hes OK.  I fucked up, but thisll 
      be OK.  


                                      99.
             PAIGE
      OK?  You dont get it!!
        (points at the Kid)
      Thats my brother!  Thats all I 
      have.

Mike goes to speak - but hes got nothing.

             PAIGE
	(CONTD)
      Oh - whats the matter?  No 
      bullshit excuse for that?  No 
      clever line to calm me down?  

             MIKE
      Paige--

             PAIGE
      Shut up!  I see you, dude. You 
      think youve got everyone all 
      figured out, but I see you.   

             MIKE
      Yeah?  What do you see?    

             PAIGE
      You talk a big game, and cause 
      youre so cool you got everybody 
      buying the shit you sell.  But 
      youre just a fuckin loser, pulling 
      everybody down into your shit.  

             MIKE
      Youre fuckin crazy.

             PAIGE
      Yeah, and youre a thirty year old 
      bullshit male stripper.  

             MIKE
      Fuck you.   

             PAIGE
      Great answer.  Next time try 
      youre right, I need help.

             MIKE
      Get out.

Paige bends down to pick the Kid off the floor.  Hes limp, 
she struggles.  Mike goes to help--

             PAIGE
      JUST LET ME CARRY HIM!


                                     100.
Mike backs off.  Paige lifts the Kids arm over her shoulder, 
walks him to the door.  Mike watches as they exit. 

He looks around his wrecked house, breathes--  

Then, he PUNCHES his wall!  The force is so hard his fist 
goes right through.  He hits it AGAIN and AGAIN--

INT. PAIGES CAR - MOMENTS LATER

Paige drives.  The Kid wakes up in the backseat, covered in 
vomit. He gets his bearings, sees Paige.  They meet eyes - 
shes on the verge of tears.

             THE KID
        (sheepish)
      My bad, sis...

Paige looks at him like she wants to hug him and kill him at 
the same.  She lets out a nervous laugh as a tear falls-- 

             PAIGE
      I cant take it anymore, Adam.  

             THE KID
      I know.  

EXT. MIKES BEACH CONDO - THAT AFTERNOON

Mike walks back from the beach.  Rows of houses with for sale-
signs line the community.  Mike sees TOBIAS waiting in his 
driveway.  He walks up.  

             MIKE
      Hey.  

             TOBIAS
      Hey, buddy.  Been trying your cell 
      all day.

             MIKE
      Left my phone at the house.

             TOBIAS
      Yo, that claim come in yet?  I 
      gotta tell my guys something.

             MIKE
      They fucked up, man. 


                                     101.
             TOBIAS
      I know.  Theyre willing go down to 
      $500 in consideration--

             MIKE
        (snapping)
      Fuck them!  If they want it tell em 
      to come and get it from me!

             TOBIAS
      Chill.  We made a deal.  So Ill 
      tell them youll give em the $500 
      when you calm down. 

Mike looks at Tobias.

             MIKE
      OK, buddy.

             TOBIAS
      You seen the Kid around?  He aint 
      picking up his phone either. 

             MIKE
      Yeah - he had a rough night.

             TOBIAS
      We all did, but hes late on a 
      front.  

             MIKE
      Its a hundred bucks.  Relax, hes 
      good for it.     

             TOBIAS
      A hundred bucks?  He went in on a 
      pack with me.

             MIKE
        (Jesus)
      WHAT?  How much is his half? 

             TOBIAS
      Five grand.  
        (off Mikes look)
      Listen, Mikey - this kids gonna 
      have a tough time dancing if his 
      fucking legs dont work. He needs 
      to take care of this, now. The only 
      reason I'm giving him the benefit 
      of the doubt is cause of you. Hes 
      been putting me off for weeks. 

Mike takes a deep breath, thinks.


                                     102.
             MIKE
      Come inside.

INT. MIKES BEACH CONDO - MOMENTS LATER

Mike opens up his WALL SAFE, takes out his MONEY, starts 
counting it--

                                 FADE TO:

INT. CHILIS RESTAURANT - DAYS LATER

Mike waits in a booth.  THE KID comes in, sits down.

             THE KID
      Hey.

             MIKE
      Hey.  How you doing?

             THE KID
      Good.  Sore throat, about it.

             MIKE
      You're the luckiest damn kid I've 
      ever met.  

             THE KID
      Im luckier my sister didnt kill 
      me.  

             MIKE
      Yeah.  Hows Zora?

             THE KID
      I went back to see her last night 
      at Mons Venus.  She was dancing on 
      stage with two fuckin black eyes.

             MIKE
        (chuckles)
      You talk to her at all?

             THE KID
      Thats what messed up.  I asked her 
      if she wanted to hang out later and 
      she told me to deal with her pimp.

             MIKE
      Whatd I tell you, Kid?  


             THE KID      I know, I know.  

A WAITRESS takes their orders.  The Kid turns back to Mike.

                                     103.

             THE KID
	(CONTD)
      Listen, I dont know what to say 
      about the money.  Just-- thanks for 
      doing that, you didnt have to.

             MIKE
      Eh - youd do it for me.

             THE KID
        (would I?)
      Im gonna pay you back. 

             MIKE
      I know.  I was thinkin maybe you 
      could help me set up some shit to 
      get my company going.  We could 
      work on it together, you know.  
      Like a business plan.  

             THE KID
      Yeah--
        (beat)
      You mean like take a break from the 
      club?  

             MIKE
      Yeah, I guess.  Just take it easy 
      for a bit, you know.      

On the Kid - not what he had in mind.

             THE KID
      Listen - I know I fucked up.  But 
      Im not ruining this for both of 
      us.  This is Miami, man.  Were 
      gonna own a piece of that club. 

             MIKE
      I dont know.  These last few days, 
      I just started thinkin, you know--

             THE KID
      I know, man.  But whatre we gonna 
      do?  Open up a building business in 
      this economy when we got a gold 
      mine just laying at our feet?  

On Mike - maybe the Kids right.  


                                     104.
             THE KID
	(CONTD)
      This is our opportunity.  Were 
      good at this, and you know how 
      crazy its gonna be.  Plus I aint 
      goin back to Dillards.

             MIKE
      Why not?  At least you smelled good 
      back then.  

They laugh.

             THE KID
      Come on - lets do this.  We got 
      the blowout show this weekend, Ill 
      start paying you back, well get 
      down to Miami and itll be like 
      none of this ever happened.  

             MIKE
      What about Paige?

             THE KID
      Im leaving on Sunday, dude.  The 
      other night was the last straw - we 
      aint made to be roommates.    

             MIKE
      You could say that again.  

The Kid lifts his beer.  

             THE KID
      Hey--  To great friends and 
      beautiful futures.

Mike looks at the Kid - its like looking into a mirror.  

He smiles, raises his glass--  CHEERS.

EXT. XQUISITE - SATURDAY NIGHT

FLYERS featuring Mike and the Kid scatter the ground.  The 
Xquisite Closeout Blowout!  Girls file in in droves.  

INT. DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The Kid, Mike, and all the strippers get dressed.  

             MIKE
      See Tito, your problem is the 
      details.  



                                     105.
             MIKE
	(CONT'D)
      The frozen yogurt stands didnt 
      work out because you put them in 
      the malls.  You shoulda gone to the 
      waterfront where theres less 
      competition.

             TITO
      Who knew Pinkberry was gonna be so 
      huge?  

             KEN
      Fuck Pinkberry.  Im telling you 
      guys its all about these Hospis 
      stores.  You just buy the shit from 
      em for nothing, then re-sell it on 
      E-Bay with premium branding and 
      shit.  Huge margins, huge.    

             THE KID
      Whats Ebays cut?

             TITO
      Like thirty-three percent.

             KEN
      Im sure we could get them down if 
      we deal in bulk.

             THE KID
      What if we sold it off our own 
      website?  I mean, with social 
      networking we have the power to 
      just do it ourselves.

On the other strippers - the Kid has a point.  Tobias enters--

             TOBIAS
      Gotta get that boom boom boom--

He passes around some mini bottles of GHB.  TARZAN downs one.  
Dallas enters.

             DALLAS
        (loudly)
      Yall ready to go out with a bang?
        (mimics banging a girl)

They stippers clap.  The crowd ROARS outside.  

             DALLAS
	(CONTD)
      Suit up, my brothers.  Im joining 
      you tonight.   

They all throw on MONK ROBES.  Dallas throws one on as well.


GREGORIAN CHANT music swells--
                                     106.

MOMENTS LATER:

The strippers line up on stage in the darkness - MONKS 
praying in a V-formation.  Dallas looks at Mike.

             DALLAS
	(CONTD)
      Just like old times, partner.

             MIKE
      Yeah.

             DALLAS
      You ready to live the dream?

Mike looks at Dallas.  Dallas smiles--

Then, the LIGHTS GO UP as the song transitions to ITS 
RAINING MEN.  The gigantic CROWD GOES WILD!

The dancers shed their robes and begin their routine.

Mike watches as Dallas grabs a torch, BLOWS FIRE into the 
air, dances wildly out into the crowd, grinds on some girls.

Dollar bills rain down as Mike and the Kid dance into the 
crowd.

                                  CUT TO:

INT. BACKSTAGE - MOMENTS LATER

The shows in full swing.  Tarzan dances as the other 
strippers change backstage.

             DALLAS
	(O.S.)
        (over P.A.)
      Alright you lovely ladies - this is 
      Tarzans last time swinging through 
      these trees, so he wont mind if 
      you defile him.  He likes it dirty!

Mike puts on his CUT-OFF TUX outfit while the Kid puts on his 
COWBOY costume.  

             THE KID
      This is nuts!  You see that blonde 
      in the front row?

             MIKE
      With the huge rack?  


                                     107.
             THE KID
        (nods)
      Im hittin that.  She was eye-
      fuckin the shit outta me.    

             MIKE 
      Go for it.

             THE KID
      See you out there, man.  

The Kid walks out, leaving Mike alone.  He looks into the 
MIRROR as he pulls his pants over his thong, buckles them--

On his face, studying his reflection--

INT. STAGE - CONTINUOUS

Tarzans routine ends.  

             DALLAS 
        (over P.A)
      Cmon and show some love for our 
      wild, beastly friend, ladies!  

Tarzan wobbles off the stage.  On his way he stops, teeters-- 
Is he gonna G out again?  

Then, he catches his breath, carries on.  

             DALLAS
	(CONTD)
        (over P.A.)
      A little too much jungle juice for 
      Tarzan.  

The lights dim, turn BLUE.  The FOG MACHINE spurts--

The beginnings of Ushers MY WAY fade up from the speakers--

             DALLAS
	(CONTD)
      Alright, ladies.  You know what 
      time it is.  Its time for our 
      featured performer!
        (cheers)
      His names traveled for miles.  His 
      moves mystify the mysterious.  His 
      gaze can pierce your soul.  And for 
      the very last time in Tampa 
      history, please welcome up to that 
      center stage-- the Houdini of the 
      dance floor, Mister-- MAGIC MIKE!!!    

The girls SCREAM!  On the stage--


                                     108.
Nobody steps out.  Fog blows.

Tobias looks at Dallas, loops the song.

             DALLAS
	(CONTD)
      For the last time ever, Mister 
      Magic Mike...

Still nothing.  A few seconds go by.  On the faces of the 
GIRLS in the audience, waiting, confused.  

             DALLAS
	(CONTD)
      Maaaagic Mike!

Nothing.  Dallas rushes backstage.

INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

             DALLAS
      Mike!  What the fuck?

Dallas rushes in, looks around-- Mikes nowhere to be found.  
All the other guys shrug-- they dont know where he is.

INT. MIKES TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

MIKE DRIVES, still dressed in his cut-off tux.  He breathes 
hard.  The Tampa urban sprawl speeds by outside.

INT. BACKSTAGE - MOMENTS LATER

Dallas takes a moment to think--

The crowd grows RESTLESS.  Dallas looks at THE KID.  

             DALLAS
      You ready, my man?  

The Kid takes a moment, thinks--

INT. MIKES TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

Mike drives, takes a turn, pulls the car to a stop.

He looks out the window at something, breathes.

DEAD OR ALIVE plays--


                                     109.
             DALLAS
	(O.S.)
        (over P.A.)
      For the last time ever here at

INT. XQUISITE STAGE - MOMENTS LATER

The song kicks into high gear as THE KID launches into his 
routine--

Girls go crazy and shower the stage with dollar bills.  On 
the Kid.  Hes the man now--

INT. PAIGES APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Paige reads in bed, hears a LOUD KNOCKING at her door.  She 
gets up, walks to the door, opens it--

MIKE stands there, sweating, in his cut-off tux.  She looks 
him over - somethings definitely not right.

             PAIGE
      Hey.  What are you doing here?  

             MIKE
        (I dont know)
      I, ummm--

             PAIGE
      Arent you supposed to be at the 
      show? 

             MIKE
      Yeah.  Listen, I--  

             PAIGE
      What?

             MIKE
      I just-- I need to talk.  

Paige studies him a moment - this isnt the Mike she knows.  

             PAIGE
      Cmon in.    

She opens the door, lets him in.  


They sit down and look at each other.
